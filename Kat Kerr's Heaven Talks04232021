12:25
hey thank you Father for speaking amen
12:31
[Music]
12:41
amen we thank you for your presence
12:44
[Music]
12:52
the stand before the throne of God is a
12:54
powerful life-changing
12:56
[Music]
13:00
your flesh dies I know a lot of people
13:04
say you cannot see the face of God you
13:06
will die you're right your flesh will
13:12
die every thought you had of what was
13:17
important what was great
13:20
who you are what plans you had what you
13:23
thought about others even those who
13:25
attack you it dies it's like dust it's
13:31
like it never existed when you're
13:35
standing before the Holy One and you
13:38
burn for him because you're burning with
13:43
him our God has eyes of flames of fire
13:49
that's his passion for all of us even
13:53
those who don't know him he loves them
13:57
we all came from him we chose different
14:01
paths in our lives some of us just ran
14:05
immediately after him some took the time
14:09
to do it but they are now running after
14:11
them but even if it's at the very end
14:14
they run after him we all will receive a
14:18
great reward he does not want you to
14:23
remember your past when you did not
14:25
belong to him neither does he want you
14:28
to remember or talk about others paths
14:30
their past before they belong to him we
14:35
cannot repeat a matter we cannot speak
14:39
against our sisters and brothers if
14:41
they're born again now God remembers
14:44
none of their past why can never happen
14:48
we cannot hold things against people if
14:52
they repented God and given their self
14:54
to him it's like God said you remember
14:59
it no more that means you act like it
15:03
never happened that is love love is not
15:09
just loving God and hating others that's
15:13
not love because if he sent us to love
15:17
and to be just like him then you have to
15:21
forgive even if people have not said
15:24
something to you even if they haven't
15:27
said I'm sorry it happened you have to
15:30
act like it never happened
15:31
love does not remember that walking in
15:41
real love is living the truth and loving
15:45
others we cannot approve or agree with
15:50
their sin not ever sin is sin last night
15:57
he had me explained that making mistakes
16:00
that's different than sinning making a
16:03
mistake you just say I'm sorry that's an
16:05
apology okay so you can apologize for
16:08
things if there was no sin involved you
16:11
don't have to repent for that but we
16:15
have to be like him that's why he died
16:18
he died to multiply himself it says
16:22
don't think it's bad to count yourself
16:24
equal with him or he would not have said
16:28
we are joint heirs when the father said
16:34
and the son know ye not that ye are gods
16:38
they weren't saying that we were the god
16:42
of everything they were saying that we
16:45
are in their family we are many ones
16:49
many and what they were saying was you
16:52
have the right to have authority in the
16:54
spirit realm you have the right to have
16:56
power over all the part of the enemy you
16:58
have the right to stop the storms to
17:00
stop the earthquakes to multiply food to
17:04
call those things to be not as though
17:07
they were we can do that we are the
17:12
father sons and daughters
17:15
we're joint heirs with Christ he is our
17:19
bridegroom
17:19
[Music]
17:22
we cannot say that we're sinners saved
17:25
by grace anymore because you are not a
17:29
sinner and if you say that you're
17:33
talking about your past he does not want
17:36
you to talk about your past if you talk
17:40
about your past you will stay in that
17:42
place and if you talk about other's
17:45
pasts that are now believers you will
17:49
stay in that time our words are precious
17:54
but they're powerful we cannot ignore
17:57
what the word says about our words
18:00
everything he made he spoke into being
18:04
you speak things into being whether good
18:08
are not good if people are continually
18:13
bashing you and hating you
18:15
you have to forgive them but they
18:17
themselves are putting themself into
18:18
place they're not going to want to be in
18:20
because there are consequences to sin
18:25
even believers who do that are putting
18:28
yourself in a place they won't want to
18:30
be in and I pray for God to have mercy
18:32
on them I've had to forgive a lot and
18:37
act like it never happened even though
18:41
those people may not want to even accept
18:45
that that I pray for them for God to
18:47
have mercy on them to forgive them for
18:50
what they say against me or accuse me
18:52
wrongly of because I tell you the
18:56
persecution is the evidence that I am
18:59
doing right if you're being persecuted
19:03
God said count it as evidence that
19:06
you're standing in the right place with
19:09
him and he does not hold any of that
19:11
against you and I even tell people don't
19:15
even write it down what people have said
19:18
against me I don't want you to write it
19:20
down I have forgive them I want you to
19:23
act like they never did it that's true
19:26
forgiveness because then you won't
19:28
repeating it later you won't be
19:30
repeating it
19:33
you really have to be like that if
19:35
you're gonna represent him you can't
19:38
decide to be that way one day and then
19:40
walk in the flesh the next day when you
19:44
do that you are stepping back you can't
19:47
go forward in the kingdom making
19:49
conquest for Christ crushing the
19:52
darkness pushing it back speaking to the
19:55
water the land the air if you're doing
20:00
that going forward and then all of a
20:02
sudden decide you're just going to get
20:03
in the flesh and blasts people crush
20:05
people with your words you have a step
20:07
back into the flesh you stopped you
20:12
stepped out of the spirit walking in the
20:14
spirit you step back in the flesh this
20:16
is life this is death you speak life
20:21
you speak death you draw a life to
20:24
yourself you draw death to yourself if
20:27
you keep doing that you will not be fit
20:29
that doesn't mean you won't be in heaven
20:31
that doesn't mean he won't love you that
20:33
means you are not fit to go forward and
20:35
rule in the kingdom because when you do
20:41
that there's really no forward motion
20:43
this is what you're doing you can't go
20:46
to the next level of glory if you're
20:47
doing this all the time you're not going
20:50
to be a good witness if you're doing
20:51
this all the time people will not know
20:53
or even believe that you belong to God
20:55
if you love them one moment and then
20:57
you're bashing them if you love
20:59
strangers but you're bashing your own
21:02
family you tell about Christ how awesome
21:05
he is then you repeat everything wrong
21:07
that your family members are doing you
21:10
are going in the spirit and you're
21:12
stepping in the flesh because your flesh
21:14
wants to do that when you're walking in
21:17
the spirit and going forward you will
21:19
not fulfill the desires of the flesh and
21:24
the more you walk in the spirit you
21:27
begin to walk in his ways and you let
21:32
him have his will and when you begin to
21:35
do that consistently he will then give
21:38
you his own thoughts you cannot ask for
21:43
his thoughts
21:44
you can ask for his way you can ask for
21:47
his will and only when you begin to walk
21:50
in that will he give you his thoughts
21:54
and you want his thoughts the more you
21:59
have his thoughts the more you will know
22:01
him and understand him the more you will
22:04
want to be like him and not yourself and
22:10
what you actually becoming is the real
22:13
you that is not touched or controlled by
22:18
the flesh that then cannot be touched or
22:21
controlled by the enemy because the
22:24
enemy cannot use a dead person so when
22:30
you die to yourself to your own will to
22:34
your rights to your opinions to your
22:37
attitudes when you die to that you get
22:40
filled with him and the enemy will run
22:43
from you because you have died that is a
22:48
good place to be if I ever have a school
22:51
it's gonna be the school of dying and if
22:54
you don't come dead we will kill you
22:58
because I love being dead when your dad
23:04
things can't penetrate you the enemy can
23:07
waste his time all day long trying to
23:10
convince you of something and you can
23:12
just flick him away and he will run
23:15
people not waste his time on you trying
23:19
to use you or control you he will have
23:22
no control over you what we allow is
23:27
what we have right now what we have done
23:31
with our own will and chosen with our
23:33
will makes us who we are right now as a
23:37
man thinketh in his soul
23:41
so is he if you don't like you change it
23:46
say something different live differently
23:50
don't let people you know what that
23:53
means but it says got no me and take
23:55
your crown that means if you let people
23:58
wound you or hurt you or put fear in you
24:03
your crown is sliding off your head and
24:06
you let man do that man's words are not
24:10
supposed to hurt us or control us we
24:15
belong to the Living God we don't listen
24:18
to hell
24:19
we don't speak hell's language they have
24:24
one language just called profanity if
24:27
you have an issue with it get rid of it
24:30
because what you speak here will draw
24:34
the light or the darkness to you
24:37
fulfilled with the light of God and you
24:40
let darkness get in when the enemy comes
24:42
to check you out he'll see gray you
24:45
don't want him to see gray in use you
24:48
cannot mix the light with the darkness
24:52
it says don't hide your light how do you
24:54
hide your light you're letting darkness
24:58
in this is a holy time it's an exciting
25:05
time it's a powerful time it is a
25:08
humbling time if you all come believe
25:13
before God then you don't have
25:16
consequences this is a time of blessings
25:20
this is God's time to bless us this is
25:23
our time of great wealth great
25:26
excitement great prosperity joy
25:28
celebration creativity that's the time
25:32
you're in right now we're not living in
25:36
the past anymore we're whatever people
25:39
judge us judged us as we begin to
25:41
believe that God validates you not man
25:49
there's a lot of profits that really
25:51
only hearing God they may hear a word
25:54
and give a word but if that were to
25:57
crushes somebody that's mixed with man
26:02
if you don't say humble before God
26:05
especially as a prophet and you get
26:08
filled with yourself and people begin to
26:10
idolize you that voice that you hear
26:14
gets really thin and you begin to mix it
26:19
with your flesh and the word sounds good
26:22
and it sounds right but what kind of
26:25
spirit is this person walking in
26:29
we can't let self rule us we all have
26:34
wills we have a will we have a choice he
26:37
made us that way on purpose even the
26:39
Angels have a will the Angels have a
26:40
soul they had to choose were they going
26:45
to follow God or Lucifer every one of
26:48
them in heaven was tempted and he won
26:52
one third while he lived in heaven while
26:57
all these dangers lived in heaven they
26:59
knew God they knew he was a creator and
27:01
yet they chose the lie and when you
27:07
choose deception you become so deceived
27:10
you can't see that you're deceived
27:12
people believing these messages that say
27:16
you can freely send all you want to and
27:18
the grace will cover is alive from Hell
27:21
and sometimes you can't convince them
27:24
because they had said yes they have said
27:26
yes the people have said yes I can live
27:28
any way I want to it doesn't matter the
27:30
blood of Christ set me free you need to
27:37
keep your discernment sharp you need to
27:40
stay in the word you need to have a time
27:42
with God time with the Lord on purpose
27:46
if you have to set a clock and say I'm
27:49
meeting with you tonight at 10:30
27:53
and you go sitting-room and you wait and
27:56
just say I am here if you have to do
28:00
that for seven months two years three
28:03
years I promise you one day he's gonna
28:08
walk through the walls and you will see
28:11
him face to face whatever it cost to
28:17
know him it's worth it
28:18
but in running after him you cannot
28:22
abandon your family when you go to
28:27
heaven this is what God will say to you
28:32
he will not say how many people have you
28:35
won he would not say how much have you
28:39
given away to others he won't say that
28:42
he'll say did you love your family well
28:48
that's what he's gonna ask you the ones
28:52
he gave us and put us together
28:54
he chose before this earth was made who
28:58
your family members would be he put you
29:02
in a lineage he made you a generation of
29:06
something and we are accountable for how
29:10
we treat them we cannot force them to
29:12
receive Christ but you have to love them
29:16
you cannot enable them to stay in the
29:19
place they are if they're in drugs or
29:22
pornography or even crime don't give
29:25
them a place to live with you you will
29:29
enable them to stay right where they are
29:33
when they're old enough to know better
29:35
and understand and they don't want to go
29:37
by the guidelines the God has given you
29:40
to live by then they should not live
29:42
with you it's true we had many people
29:48
come and stay with us and if they didn't
29:51
want to go by the guidelines God has set
29:53
for our household we had to ask them to
29:55
leave because they'll bring hell with
29:58
them and you'll be battling it all the
30:01
time
30:03
so make sure you're hearing God clearly
30:05
if he said you help this person and then
30:09
ask him how do you want me to help them
30:11
because some of this some of us have big
30:14
hearts and it's hard not to just run get
30:17
them and bring them in because you have
30:19
such an awesome atmosphere presence of
30:21
God in your home but you want to
30:23
maintain that and if they're if they're
30:25
saying yes to your help they should be
30:27
willing to attend church they should be
30:31
willing to read the Word of God they
30:33
should be willing to allow you to pray
30:35
for them and if they won't do those
30:37
things then they don't have a right to
30:38
be with you amen see if you have
30:44
college-age kids that come home and
30:46
bring their drugs with them don't let
30:48
them stand at the door and say we love
30:51
you but that cannot come in you cannot
30:55
invite your friends over who are wicked
30:56
or living evilly because you're helping
31:01
them to stay in that place my mom would
31:05
just say I'm giving you to God and he
31:07
can help you but you cannot stay here
31:10
if you cannot maintain this atmosphere
31:13
that we have here
31:14
I had a great mom was she's still here
31:19
she lives with me she's still my mother
31:23
although I'm 66 I'm still her daughter
31:27
she absolutely loves my husband he is
31:31
the head of our house right now which is
31:35
very challenging right now since we all
31:38
live in our office I kept telling God I
31:42
wanted office is good change your home
31:43
into an office
31:46
you put everything in storage that is
31:48
yours personally and you make this look
31:51
like an office and we had 14 staff every
31:57
room and that place is the office even
32:00
our bedrooms have desks in it there are
32:03
no beds in there we sleep on sofas or
32:07
nice lounges but we obey we already know
32:12
the place that he's going to give us a
32:14
beautiful place beyond anything we could
32:16
afford and we know he's going to give it
32:20
to us but we obey when you set something
32:22
so make sure you know what you really
32:24
want when you ask him and not only that
32:29
we have the staff around us all the time
32:31
like running our microscope would you
32:36
like to move 14 people in with you if we
32:42
go off somewhere and we can't even say
32:43
we're going back home we're going back
32:45
to the office it's his office he can do
32:48
what he wants to there that's why he
32:51
trusts us because we've laid down our
32:54
own desires and our life for whatever he
32:58
wants whenever he wants it wherever he
33:02
wants it so it's wonderful to share
33:06
beautiful things to people about how
33:09
grand and fill with splendor and not
33:13
just peace but the absence of evil and
33:15
fear heaven is it's wonderful to talk
33:19
about these great days on the earth that
33:21
is for everyone all of his children in
33:25
this time he is offering you to live on
33:28
earth as they live in heaven it's called
33:30
heaven culture it's a new culture coming
33:34
to the earth not created here but
33:39
birthed from heaven and sent here for us
33:42
to tell and show what heaven is who he
33:49
is and who we are and when you choose to
33:52
live that way you live free from sin
33:55
free from lack free from fear
34:00
free from the enemy and heaven comes in
34:04
partners with you the angels are seen
34:07
all the time in her home and around our
34:08
home by people by the neighbors who
34:11
aren't even Christians they either
34:16
change or move really today my message
34:26
for you is how to live heaven culture
34:28
which also means to partner and command
34:33
the army of heaven heaven did not create
34:38
an army to protect itself god never
34:43
created the army to protect him he made
34:48
them
34:50
he doesn't need their protection he made
34:54
them for a purpose every tribe of angels
34:56
angels are made in tribes some of those
35:00
tribes are under Gabriel some are under
35:02
Lucifer and some were under Michael my
35:07
friends are the ones under Michael I
35:11
know some of them by name because the
35:13
father introduced me or jesus introduced
35:16
me our Holy Spirit introduced me this is
35:18
what happens when you become the friend
35:20
of God you become a friend of heaven
35:23
they celebrate your life because they
35:26
know you're gonna speak only truth that
35:30
you will forgive no matter what is said
35:32
or done against you you will bring life
35:34
and hope wherever you go that the glory
35:38
will wash over people the anointing will
35:40
wipe out the evidence of hell and hell
35:45
will burn if they touch that anointing
35:48
you know things about the past before
35:53
the earth was made you're shown things
35:56
about the future even the new earth God
36:00
did that with many of his friends my dad
36:02
was God's friend I found out about the
36:06
Father the Son and Holy Spirit from my
36:08
earthly father and his mother and we
36:11
have seven generations
36:13
of us who knew him most of them are
36:17
living in heaven right now they wanted
36:20
to go to heaven the other thing that the
36:24
Lord is offering is if you want to
36:25
remain till he comes again this is a new
36:30
time a new time when the supernatural
36:34
beyond your imagination will happen
36:36
there is not one human on this earth
36:38
that can gauge what the presence of God
36:42
the Father does when it touches
36:45
something but we will feel that on this
36:50
earth all flesh will feel it that'll be
36:55
a new day you've ever wondered about the
36:58
baptism and fire it has not happened yet
37:00
because you will know when it does you
37:05
the day the Holy Spirit moved inside of
37:07
you packed up his stuff and moved in you
37:11
knew when that day was you knew when
37:13
Christ became your Savior and then if
37:17
you loved him to be your Lord that's a
37:20
whole different thing you knew when that
37:23
happened so when you get baptized in
37:28
fire you will know it you will not have
37:34
to ask someone do I have the fire of God
37:37
because I've only had a measure of it I
37:40
still remember the day the month and the
37:45
year that happened to me when I received
37:49
it I was in church
37:50
and I was thrown and hid the usher
37:53
behind me and through both of us back
37:56
three or four rows into the congregation
37:59
it burned me like a blowtorch it burned
38:02
everything off the walls of my heart
38:04
that was not God it took away the memory
38:08
of some things that I didn't want it
38:11
catapulted me out of this world into
38:15
heaven my spirit man was taken out of me
38:21
and it was taken back in time it was
38:25
like you see on
38:26
Star Trek or Star Wars when they go warp
38:28
speed I watched he takes you back in
38:31
time and we were flying at such a rate
38:34
all I could see was light shooting at me
38:36
Shh
38:39
and I felt myself traveling it's the
38:41
only time every time he catches me up in
38:43
heaven I'm here and then I'm up there
38:47
and he was taking me back because he was
38:51
blessed that I had obeyed and said yes
38:53
when he asked if I wanted that and for
38:59
two weeks I could only speak in tongues
39:02
my body was in the church shaking and
39:05
they locked me in with a security guard
39:07
my pastor was wise enough to not touch
39:10
me they left a note stuffed up in the
39:14
sleeve my daughter when my mother comes
39:17
to and can crawl over to the side
39:19
call this number my dad will come and
39:21
get her
39:26
guys probably they're like 10 hours or
39:28
12 hours my body shook the whole time it
39:32
was the fire on me it's one of the
39:35
evidences yo shake you'll burn your body
39:38
will get so hot it will burn all fear
39:42
out of you it'll burn out the fear of
39:44
the face of man you'll burn
39:47
fear out of the face of the enemy it
39:51
will make you so bold you stand in the
39:55
highest mountain until everyone around
39:56
you about him all I talk about is a
40:00
father son Holy Spirit heaven the future
40:04
the new earth our weapons he's given us
40:08
crushing the darkness not tolerating the
40:12
enemy changing the atmosphere speaking
40:15
to the ground so produce can come up
40:17
speaking to the storms and the
40:19
earthquakes and the tsunamis and
40:22
avalanches even the fires it doesn't
40:25
matter
40:26
it can't a pulse you into a whole new
40:28
place where you fear nothing because
40:32
that fire you're gonna be baptized with
40:34
comes from the heart of the Father the
40:38
consuming fire that burns in him and
40:41
outside of him that the Lightning shoots
40:44
out of you may expect that to happen to
40:46
you one day
40:47
it's didn't somewhere a lightning bolt
40:49
start shooting on you that's fine with
40:53
me if he wants to do that I don't mind I
40:57
don't mind you're not the same person
41:01
and I only had a measure like a drop
41:08
when that fire touches the people on
41:12
this earth they're either gonna run into
41:14
God or run to get away from it the enemy
41:20
is terrified of that day he tear he's
41:24
gonna be terrified he's gonna lose a lot
41:26
of those who followed him a lot of the
41:30
supernatural be seen openly angels will
41:32
be seen everywhere moving and doing
41:34
things with
41:37
heaven really is invading this earth and
41:39
then the veils gonna be ripped away and
41:41
the spirit realm will be evident
41:45
there's the convergence of the spirit
41:48
realm into this natural realm it's gonna
41:52
happen and no one can stop it from
41:53
happening I'd rather be operating in it
41:58
than be ignorant of it that's why we get
42:07
baptized and fire it is literally a
42:11
separate baptism the Holy Spirit looks
42:18
like he's on fire all the time I see
42:22
fire trails all the time in my house but
42:27
when I go somewhere and sit and get up I
42:29
see fire on that seat everything I touch
42:34
I release it into it it can't be erased
42:38
it can't be washed off it can never be
42:41
watered down it's an eternal thing this
42:46
is what he wants for everyone this is
42:49
his passion for everyone to walk in that
42:51
place I'm not so special that I have
42:55
something you can't have but I chose it
42:59
I chose it every time he asked me
43:03
something I said yes so if you play with
43:08
your foot half way in the world and half
43:10
way in heaven you're not gonna go
43:13
anywhere because you're also like this
43:15
you get pulled from this side then your
43:18
friends are something influential to go
43:19
over here or you watch a horrible
43:22
demonic movie with graphic violence
43:24
profane language and sexuality you're
43:27
gonna be pulled way over here because it
43:29
goes in your soul what you watch goes in
43:33
your soul
43:34
well you here goes in your soul what you
43:38
say goes in everyone's soul that's in
43:41
hearing distance it goes in your own
43:43
soul you have layers in your soul so
43:48
whatever you Lao
43:49
on those layers that get stored there
43:51
that's why you can remember things your
43:57
your soul is your mind what you think
43:59
about your will what you choose to do or
44:05
not to do to say or not to say to hear
44:08
or not to hear you're the right to tell
44:11
anybody who's using profane language I'm
44:13
sorry but you know I don't listen to
44:15
health language and I'd like to spend
44:17
time with you but but you know I have to
44:19
go because I'm guarding my soul I let
44:23
God use my soul if you'd like to do that
44:26
let me know because if you stand there
44:29
and just allow and allowing allowing it
44:31
you're filling it in your soul
44:33
eventually it will come out of your
44:35
mouth amen
44:40
so this is a new way to live it's a
44:43
lifestyle change you're not here getting
44:46
a just a Bible meeting this is not
44:49
something just to try to remember some
44:51
scriptures that's not why I'm here I
44:54
already did that growing up the word
44:57
lives in me it comes out of me all the
44:59
time because I put it there but I've
45:04
guarded my heart and my soul for a long
45:06
time and I realized even in high school
45:10
I didn't have to be around people that
45:11
did stuff I was never part of a group or
45:14
a clique I didn't do drugs that happened
45:19
started in the 60s when I was in high
45:21
school I didn't tolerate it and they
45:23
found out real soon if they asked me
45:25
they would never ask me again so I set a
45:30
boundary boundaries for myself I wasn't
45:34
forced to take those boundaries but I
45:36
set them for myself and I stuck to them
45:39
because I realized even back then I knew
45:42
there was a god I really believed you
45:45
saw everything that I did or thought and
45:48
I knew my own angels because I'm a seer
45:51
we're with me all the time they live
45:54
with you give them some slack okay watch
46:00
something good
46:02
say something good someone wants to
46:04
fight don't fight with them your angel
46:06
will be cheering you on and applauding
46:09
you for speaking life when they're
46:12
giving you death and do you know that
46:15
when someone's bashing you to your face
46:16
you begin to say how much God loves them
46:19
you're piercing their soul with those
46:21
words and those words won't leave their
46:25
soul and there's something in there that
46:27
can fight the darkness in them I've seen
46:31
people in these fights domestic fights
46:34
or just fight somewhere you know
46:36
screaming at each other little demon
46:39
sits here and pricks that person who's
46:41
angry or upset and says to them I hate
46:46
you I can't stand you I don't ever want
46:49
to see you again and out of their mouth
46:50
I hate you I can't stand you I never
46:52
want to see you again and when the
46:55
person across them starts yelling back
46:57
they're doing that because this demon
46:58
jumped to the other person's over one
47:01
little demon this big they'll prick them
47:04
and give him the answer and the answer
47:06
will shoot out of their mouths and
47:07
escalates and then they're screaming
47:10
really horrible things and all is this
47:12
demon jumping back and forth picking
47:14
them laughing and laughing and laughing
47:16
and laughing that they are now
47:18
controlling those people whether they
47:21
are a believer or not you give
47:23
permission so don't do it no matter how
47:30
hard it is turn around and walk away
47:35
because you can stop that stuff we have
47:39
a choice to participate or not
47:42
participate these are all keys to
47:47
walking in the spirit the morning you
47:49
choose God's Way and not your flesh our
47:51
man's way the more you learn how to walk
47:54
in the spirit in this in walking in
47:56
spirit is more important than having
47:58
encounters being taken to heaven having
48:01
all the wealth of the world given to you
48:03
having great influence over people being
48:06
in a high position it's more important
48:08
to walk in the spirit than any of those
48:12
because in your life
48:14
God can use in great ways and you have
48:19
the most unexpected things happened to
48:21
you because you're walking in the spirit
48:25
and you're not fulfilling the desires of
48:27
the flesh amen
48:30
because what you get in return is worth
48:33
everything it's worth everything you
48:37
live in his presence all the time your
48:40
discernment becomes extremely sharp and
48:42
people won't be able to lie to you
48:44
you'll know what they're thinking before
48:46
they say something jesus knew the
48:51
thoughts and intents of everybody's
48:54
heart when it talks about the heart in
48:56
the Bible they're talking about your
48:57
soul why do they do that because you're
49:00
a living soul you are a living soul
49:04
people have described their self many
49:06
ways and held army but when he made
49:08
add-on what did he call Adam a living
49:11
soul when we lived in God we we had a
49:15
soul but we didn't need to use it we
49:17
need to decide where are we gonna live
49:18
what are going to eat what are we gonna
49:20
do we didn't have to make in those
49:22
decisions
49:23
he was our world he was our very place
49:26
of existence and him we lived we moved
49:28
we had our very being but when when Adam
49:33
was formed and the in Christ made him
49:37
the word made him when God spoke the
49:40
word made Adams body and then the father
49:43
leaned over and breathe Adams little
49:45
spiritual being into his nostrils and he
49:49
became a living soul who would then be
49:52
accountable for his actions his choices
49:56
what he was thinking what he was doing
49:58
what he was displaying because the other
50:01
part of your will is what you display in
50:04
your emotions so people know what's in
50:08
your soul and one day the father showed
50:10
me people walk up and they'll go what's
50:12
in your layers they won't say what's in
50:15
your wallet they'll be talking about the
50:18
layers of your soul if you're displaying
50:21
something that is not displaying haha
50:23
you're you're enraged something or you
50:27
just try
50:28
mashing people or you're spewing not
50:32
heaven all over the welcome to go so
50:35
what's in your layers because what I see
50:38
is not God because one day at least all
50:41
the body will know how their soul is
50:43
made and the Father said it will change
50:46
the way the body of Christ lives when
50:50
they realize what they're allowing in
50:53
there is causing them to think or act a
50:57
certain way and you can change that you
51:03
made trauma that wasn't your fault you
51:06
were innocent of it but it still was
51:08
recorded in your soul even if that abuse
51:10
wasn't against you and you saw what that
51:12
was recorded in your soul and it can
51:15
control you for the rest of your life if
51:17
you let it but you don't have to let it
51:20
you can choose with your own will to
51:22
loose that trauma from your soul like it
51:26
never happened because living heaven
51:30
culture means you're using the keys to
51:32
the kingdom every day of your life this
51:37
is a lifestyle he wants you to have any
51:40
lifestyle if you can live on earth as it
51:43
doesn't happen that means something is
51:44
going to have to change is that right we
51:47
had to have new things to understand how
51:50
we could put our self in that place and
51:52
not be affected by hell or man
51:57
the main way you do that is to keep all
51:59
their junk out no fear no offense no
52:05
unforgiveness no drugs no bashing no
52:11
doom and gloom
52:13
no fear at all no one's words that are
52:19
being said to you no matter how bad they
52:21
are you loose every word they spoke
52:24
every word sound image frequency
52:29
thoughts or actions of hell or man you
52:33
can loose them from yourself all day
52:35
long if you have to and you'll walk so
52:38
free
52:40
and your life it will be like you're
52:43
living in heaven they have a protocol to
52:47
do this you get filled with grace every
52:50
day well I have grace I'm gonna be saved
52:52
yeah you are saved you have eternal life
52:54
right but there's another kind of life
52:57
you can live - it's called abundant life
53:00
there's great fun dn't life if you know
53:06
living in abundant life you aren't
53:08
asking for that grace where is it in the
53:11
word or my throne of grace to find Grace
53:16
and help in time of need you need help
53:20
when someone's bashing you you need help
53:23
when you solve some traumatic thing or
53:25
some actions or images that you didn't
53:27
want to see what you see goes in here
53:31
does it say the eyes are the window to
53:33
the soul that wasn't just a remark that
53:37
was truth so your own self what you
53:40
choose to watch you're gonna be held
53:42
accountable for that you don't want a
53:46
lot darkness in the father said this to
53:49
me one day it's not that people or
53:52
businesses or churches cannot win but
53:58
somebody in leadership or chose to let
54:03
darkness get in it will affect you it'll
54:09
affect your whole life if you're the
54:11
head of your household it will affect
54:12
your whole family because then you're
54:15
carrying it with you and if you minister
54:19
and you got it you're giving it to
54:20
people if you're raising the family it's
54:23
going to affect everybody in there
54:25
because you allow things of the enemy to
54:27
come in if you watch horrible things on
54:29
television when your kids go to sleep
54:31
you still let the enemy come in amen we
54:37
allow or don't allow if you've been
54:40
doing that go home open the door your
54:42
house and you dipped all the enemy that
54:44
you have let in there
54:47
I'll go in people's home sometimes and
54:49
I'll see like demons standing right next
54:51
to the television they're not visitors
54:54
they're residents because of what was
54:58
continually watched in the home if you
55:01
ever buy a home that someone else lived
55:03
in make sure you cleanse it because the
55:06
atmosphere remains you're moving into it
55:09
it's there I don't go into a hotel
55:12
without kicking everything out of the
55:14
entire hotel and every room of every
55:17
every room in the hotel no matter where
55:21
I'm staying I'm not living with hell you
55:24
don't know what they watched in those
55:25
television you don't know what they did
55:28
in those rooms you don't know what they
55:30
said in those rooms because I can go to
55:32
a place and hear words that were spoken
55:33
for years ago friend of mine brought to
55:37
me - let me see their new school
55:39
facility and it was where the offices
55:43
were and the wherever I can't remember a
55:45
lot of human man things but it's where
55:48
you come in to sign in you know where
55:49
they read stuff the offices whatever I
55:52
went in there and I heard prayer like
55:55
I've never heard before I had images of
55:58
people laying on the floor crying out to
56:00
God like hundreds out there it was a
56:01
huge place they're crying out to God
56:04
calling in the move of God calling hope
56:06
for the people that were there and
56:08
crying out for their families and I said
56:11
what was this place before they said
56:14
well it's all remodel them and I'm not
56:15
talking about the Tilton what was here
56:18
what was done here they said why and I
56:21
told him what I saw and they began to
56:22
cry there but this is their 24 hour of
56:24
prayer house
56:26
all those prayers that ascended to
56:30
heaven were also still there so words
56:35
remain and some of them you wear on your
56:40
garments the Bible says do not touch a
56:46
garment spotted by the flesh people come
56:54
in my office I see words on them I hear
56:58
words that they weren't saying then my
57:03
people that my staff know that if I sit
57:06
in their chair I'll hurt every word they
57:09
said the night before I will see every
57:11
image of what they watched the night
57:12
before because the more you become like
57:16
Christ
57:17
you know the thoughts and intents
57:19
people's are and sometimes you wear it
57:23
on the outside of you it's a garment
57:27
it's been spotted by the flesh so if you
57:30
buy stuff from the thrift store
57:31
and I'm saying that because I love to go
57:34
treasure hunting I don't have to but I
57:37
love it
57:38
I will cleanse everything I buy whether
57:42
it's a trinket or a piece of clothing or
57:45
anything else that I take from there I
57:47
cleanse it for the kingdom I pick it up
57:49
I cleanse this for the kingdom it
57:51
removes everything that was ever spoken
57:53
that was in the presence of something
57:55
this is what the spirit realm is all
57:58
about this is why you need to recognize
58:00
the spirit realm is real and you don't
58:04
see it with your physical eye but it's
58:06
real and things remain that you release
58:10
in that spirit realm it's wrapped all
58:13
around this physical round when God when
58:17
God was in heaven there was nothing but
58:19
his home his world called heaven there
58:21
wasn't anything there wasn't the planets
58:22
there wasn't this earth there was
58:23
nothing and the word would step inside
58:30
the father and he would go somewhere
58:31
where there's nothing and the father
58:33
would speak and the world would step out
58:36
make it that's why the word says there
58:39
wasn't anything that was
58:39
that wasn't made by the work he was
58:43
called the word because he took his
58:45
words and made them that's how that's
58:49
done when he said Jesus said to the
58:53
Father you and me and me and you that's
58:56
what he's talking about
58:56
they went someplace together and created
58:59
together but the spirit realm is the
59:05
original round it's not just the other
59:08
realm it's not just some kind of round
59:11
it is the permanent eternal realm that
59:15
existed before this physical world was
59:18
here and when God spoke the Lord the
59:25
word there was a little drop of water
59:28
and from it he pulled a scroll and he
59:30
took the scroll and opened it like a
59:33
curtain and wrapped it around the
59:35
spiritual realm that's why at the end he
59:41
said I will take it and fold it away
59:44
like an O garment he's talking about the
59:47
physical realm talking about the plan
59:50
that's this earth people don't like it
59:52
when I say there's gonna be a new words
59:54
you should celebrate if God's gonna make
59:55
it it would be better than this one and
59:59
people go oh no the very core the center
60:01
will remain it doesn't matter
60:02
he says he's folding it all the way like
60:05
a garment you know why he knows where
60:07
the ends are and he'll just fold it up
60:10
and go away and create a whole new thing
60:16
he knows that things remain in that
60:19
spirit realm and people always talk
60:22
about well you know my dead relative is
60:24
living in my house and they turned the
60:26
lights off and I bump things no that is
60:28
not your dead relative no one remains on
60:34
this earth when they die they go one
60:39
place or the other their body may die
60:45
and be buried but their spirit man which
60:49
is very much alive
60:51
remains either in heaven or in hell and
60:55
I've seen both you want heaven because
61:00
in heaven you just to live and hell
61:02
there's not even existence let alone
61:05
living it's as real as heaven is and
61:10
what we say and do with their life will
61:13
attract one side or the other
61:15
that means your angels are with you all
61:17
the time but if you're doing something
61:19
wrong the demons are laughing at your
61:21
angels this is a real life this is this
61:25
is truth you want truth you couldn't get
61:27
all the truth that's why we're held
61:33
accountable and the thing is when you
61:35
begin to walk in the spirit you have
61:38
learned the joy of obedience when you
61:42
walk in the spirit there's not
61:43
consequences
61:45
it's a place you've lived in John was
61:51
Indy say it loud on the Lord's Day so he
61:57
wasn't in the flesh he was in the spirit
62:00
that's when you heard and saw the door
62:02
open and the voice all that that was in
62:05
the spirit when he was walking in the
62:06
spirit he probably wasn't even on the
62:08
Isle of Patmos he was the closest
62:14
disciple to Christ
62:15
he got as close to him as he could he
62:19
wanted to be just like him and this was
62:21
one of the sons of thunder who couldn't
62:23
wait to fight with his brother over
62:24
girls
62:26
he was so changed by Christ by following
62:32
Christ believing Christ he believed he
62:37
had risen from the dead remember that
62:39
John the Beloved the one Christ loved
62:42
the one who loved Christ I love all the
62:45
little tags he gave himself didn't even
62:47
say John the one who loved Christ the
62:51
one whom Christ loved where he loved all
62:54
the disciples but the one who stays the
62:56
closest gets the most of him he even
63:00
took John back in the past how do I know
63:05
because he couldn't make that statement
63:08
John couldn't state make that statement
63:10
the Word was with God and was God and
63:15
there was nothing that was made that the
63:18
word didn't make he would not have known
63:22
that unless he was shown that he also
63:25
knew the word became flesh he knew who
63:28
Christ was before he was Christ still
63:32
same being but the word was all spirit
63:37
he didn't have flesh on him he didn't
63:39
even look the same Satan did not
63:41
recognize him he kept trying to figure
63:44
out who he was do you realize that even
63:49
on the Mount of temptation he but they
63:50
didn't know who he was but he was trying
63:52
to find out because his features weren't
63:56
the same as when he was the world
64:00
because John became a friend not just a
64:06
disciple did you become God's friend he
64:09
shows you things and he takes you places
64:12
he always did that in the past he hasn't
64:15
changed he still does it
64:17
amen so that's why we need to be
64:20
accountable and really care not feel
64:23
like we're being commanded to do it or
64:26
forced to do it guys drink some water
64:34
one day I believe I won't have to eat or
64:37
drink
64:37
I've only eat of him and drink of him
64:42
and heaven you don't have to you eat
64:46
because you want to not because you have
64:50
to even God likes to eat
64:53
does she Christ Christ got ruined by the
64:57
sweets
64:59
his flesh wanted the sweets I don't
65:04
think he much cared when he was just in
65:05
the spirit all the time but when he came
65:07
to this earth grew up like we did he
65:09
fell in love with sweets blame your
65:13
sweet cheese on him we are joint heirs
65:16
with Christ I don't know very many
65:20
people that don't like sweets I will
65:22
raise my hand who likes sweets let me
65:23
see your hand
65:25

65:29
in heaven it would be chocolate and they
65:34

your apple pie whatever it is that you
70:54
like it won't run out amen and this is
70:59
the best part I actually was invited by
71:03
the Lord to go to someone's home that
71:05
was living in heaven they didn't see me
71:06
nobody in heaven sees me when he takes
71:08
me there he hides me in heaven because
71:11
if he did not they know what I do down
71:14
here they know I go there and come back
71:16
here they would be chasing me down the
71:18
streets of gold handing me pictures of
71:20
their family members with their names
71:22
written on it their addresses because
71:24
they know where you live and their phone
71:26
numbers and they would say please go
71:28
tell them I love them I'm making plans
71:31
for them I'm so excited for what they're
71:34
doing today I can't wait to see them
71:36
again that's what they say they get a
71:40
little singing a pom quarter I don't
71:42
know what you call it and every time I
71:43
see a place you would like they put it
71:45
in this when you come up in heaven
71:48
they'll hit it here comes this list and
71:51
then want to take you to every one of
71:53
those places and taste all these
71:55
different foods from different bakeries
71:56
different restaurants I was invited to
72:00
this place and I saw this dining room in
72:02
a mansion would see 100 people and all
72:08
the tables were set like a king's
72:10
banquet and all the family members and
72:13
friends and the prophets and the
72:14
Apostles all came we're coming to eat at
72:16
this person's home and everyone sat down
72:20
and they still think God for the food
72:23
isn't that awesome and then they said
72:25
what they want it appeared on
72:27
everybody's plates
72:28
to perfection Meiji perfection the best
72:33
tasting none of it was ever left on
72:36
anybody when you ate it and we're done
72:40
it all disappeared off the plates nobody
72:44
cleaned it up there is no garbage in
72:46
heaven there's no waste in heaven say
72:49
that's heaven that's where I'm gonna
72:52
live one day
72:54
don't worry about your little grandma
72:56
she's not up there scrubbing dishes for
72:58
a hundred people but I know some
73:05
grandmas that love to entertain and
73:07
actually cook cooking is our gift they
73:10
will have a fully supplied kitchen three
73:12
times bigger than this room is their
73:15
kitchen and there'll be appliances and
73:18
weird things there that we never had in
73:19
the search that they use to prepare all
73:21
the food and what they're given is not
73:24
like real animals that died it looks
73:28
like it because it's made out of light
73:31
they put in their order the angels
73:33
deliver the food and the groceries
73:36
whatever they need vegetables doesn't
73:39
matter what it is side dishes the
73:41
entrees the desserts but this grandma
73:43
that was a grandma that now looks 25 is
73:46
going to cook for all 100 people and she
73:49
I saw her I saw her in her kitchen she's
73:52
gonna make salad and they had salad
73:53
bowls like this she was slicing
73:55
cucumbers as she sliced a cucumber and
73:58
the peel came off it disappeared there
74:01
was no trash whatever she peeled off it
74:04
disappeared and she was just singing and
74:08
so happy some new family members they
74:11
come in to heaven and she was throwing a
74:12
party for them that's what she was doing
74:13
so there was no waste there was no
74:16
garbage but what was left was the best
74:18
meal they ever had so that's like what
74:21
happens when you go to visit someone in
74:22
heaven and that awesome it is worth
74:27
everything you live in the manifest
74:31
presence of God his presence is in your
74:33
furniture piss in your floor's it's in
74:37
the walls even the walls of your home
74:40
will worship God the streets of gold
74:42
worship Him every pebble in heaven has a
74:45
face and they worship God the flowers
74:47
sing the trees sing is a powerful
74:52
beautiful place to live and they are
74:55
watching our lines
75:00
now they don't see a lot of the
75:02
tragedies that happened and they don't
75:04
see every sin that somebody committed
75:06
because it's time to celebrate but they
75:09
know what God's plans are for you and
75:10
they would declare over you every day
75:14
amen if you were angry please please
75:19
hear this if you had a fight with them
75:21
and then they died and you didn't get to
75:25
say you were sorry
75:26
they already forgave you and if you
75:29
mention it to them they won't remember
75:30
it when you get there they'll be so
75:34
happy to see you if it makes you feel
75:37
better just look up and say I'm so sorry
75:39
Bob that fighting out there they're
75:40
gonna go what was that I don't remember
75:43
that they'll remember every good and
75:45
happy thing that you did every gift you
75:48
gave them every time you kiss them every
75:50
time you hugged them they love you more
75:53
now than they did when they were here
75:55
because now they're filled with that
75:57
love this is how while the love of God
76:02
is there can be somebody who killed
76:05
somebody and that person went to prison
76:07
and that person in heaven will pray all
76:12
the time
76:12
God's let them know you I forgive them I
76:16
want them to know you they need to know
76:18
you and they will pray over that person
76:20
all the time to know the Lord send
76:22
someone to talk to them
76:24
let your spirit go consume them but let
76:26
them know you that's how much they love
76:29
him that person gets saved in prison
76:31
they go home to heaven they are best
76:33
friends
76:35
best friends best friends
76:40
that's how far-reaching the love of God
76:43
is that's why he wants us to live the
76:46
way I've been talking to you about our
76:49
life is a witness it's a testimony of
76:52
who we are of who he is and you need to
76:57
know all this because one of the most
77:00
powerful things we do so there's a
77:02
protocol in heaven if you want to live
77:04
on earth like they do in heaven every
77:05
morning when you get up before you get
77:07
out of pad this works I get more emails
77:11
about this one simple thing that
77:14
anything else God has me teach people
77:18
it's the scripture about the throne of
77:20
grace you yourself every day of your
77:24
life can be filled with fuel from heaven
77:28
that will be poured into your being that
77:31
will make you feel different act
77:33
different
77:34
think different and you won't show up at
77:37
your friend's house heaven well it's
77:41
real simple the Bible says that the
77:45
father filled his own son with that
77:48
grace he didn't have to fill a son with
77:51
eternal grace but he had to have grace
77:54
for abundant life because then he could
77:57
tell people I come to bring a life and
78:00
life more abundantly
78:03
you know what abundant life is it's
78:05
being free from all kinds of things that
78:08
come you face every day
78:10
everyday normal things you go to work
78:12
people are egging where you're getting
78:13
blamed for something you didn't finish
78:15
something you're getting blasted by
78:16
somebody or ridiculed by somebody if you
78:18
are filled with that grace from heaven
78:20
it won't even touch you it won't it's
78:23
hard to even be afraid or get afraid
78:25
because fear can't penetrate it it's
78:28
heaven in you by simply saying every
78:32
morning I asked for father because
78:36
remember we're talking about his throne
78:38
father everybody say it father
78:41
say it loud father I asked for and
78:46
receive grace for this day amen
78:52
and right now in my being I feel it
78:55
being porn in it feels like light
78:58
electricity I literally feel if I said
79:01
or five times a day I would feel it
79:03
coming in its fuel and it only comes
79:06
from one place heaven how simple is that
79:10
it did not cost you a dime nothing it
79:13
cost you nothing it is free ask for it
79:17
you have not this is one major thing to
79:23
living on earth as they do in heaven
79:25
because they're filled with that all the
79:27
time they walk in it all the time
79:31
there's nobody nobody gets angry in
79:33
heaven no one's fearful nobody has
79:35
regrets nobody's condemned
79:37
nobody is rejected there's no room for
79:41
it because they are filled with heaven
79:43
you can have that on earth as it is in
79:48
heaven that is the number one thing you
79:51
learn about living on earth like they
79:53
live in heaven I had to do all these I
79:56
do every one of them the second one was
79:58
loosening stuff from your soul it's
79:59
called a soul checkup and I don't do it
80:03
every now and then I probably do it 15
80:06
times a day because of who I am and what
80:10
I'm confronted with I don't keep
80:12
anything inside of me that people say in
80:15
emails and comments on the phone in
80:18
person through a second or third person
80:21
I don't keep it I don't want it I don't
80:25
have to keep it so as soon as something
80:27
happens I go I choose to lose all those
80:29
words unkind harsh negative judgmental
80:33
words I loose them from my soul right
80:35
now I will not keep them and I bind to
80:37
my soul the love and the life of God and
80:40
then I'm joyful all the time I've
80:43
already got fuel from heaven now I'm not
80:46
keeping anything in my soul the keys to
80:48
the kingdom
80:49
what you loose on earth will be loosed
80:53
from
80:55
and heaven will come and pull it out
80:57
because Christ is the restorer of our
81:00
soul if you have cares you cast them on
81:05
him he comes and pulls them out but it's
81:08
the keys of the kingdom you bind and you
81:10
loose I bound the devil for years most
81:13
intercessors buying the devil all the
81:15
time you can buy them if you want to buy
81:17
grab the loose in light of my life
81:18
I know my family's life I'd rather loose
81:20
invite in my home and then buying the
81:23
things of God because what you lose from
81:25
your soul leaves what you bind in your
81:29
soul will remain if you want to be happy
81:33
this is this is real this is real this
81:36
is how we live on earth as we do in
81:38
heaven we do these three there's three
81:41
things it's a protocol first when you
81:44
get right second one you don't keep
81:46
anything in your soul you don't want
81:47
there and the first time you do it every
81:50
trauma you ever had is gone it can even
81:52
addictions we've even had witchcraft
81:54
spirits loose from people's soul when
81:56
they chose chose to loose it from their
81:58
soul it's gone like it never happened
82:01
what you loose on earth is loosed from
82:05
heaven like it never happened
82:07
what you bind on earth it will be bound
82:11
and written down in heaven you can find
82:14
the life of God the love of God the
82:18
presence of God the celebration the
82:23
expectation the creativity is unending
82:27
and guess what you have it in there and
82:32
then you will live like that
82:34
that's what you think on it's what you
82:37
choose it's what you're going to
82:38
demonstrate with your emotions if you
82:41
love joy and happiness and a great
82:44
future and your gift being used you can
82:48
bind every one of those to your soul and
82:50
he was trying to teach us something when
82:53
he said don't let the Sun go down upon
82:56
your wrath otherwise it will stay and
83:02
yourself and you'll get up in the
83:04
morning and you'll be angry
83:06
and you'll think about it you talk about
83:08
how angry are your filling the layers of
83:10
your soul with anger then you can stay
83:13
angry then you'll be so angry nobody
83:14
wants to be around you what is in there
83:19
is what you will become so don't let it
83:21
stay you don't have to keep it you don't
83:24
have to keep depression oppression
83:26
despair or suicidal thoughts you can
83:29
loose every one of them from your soul
83:31
the father spent four earth hours
83:34
teaching me about the keys to the
83:37
kingdom
83:37
he said because you're willing to listen
83:40
I'm gonna show you who Mel cuz if it is
83:43
she came your promises because I'm gonna
83:46
have you trained everybody everywhere
83:48
you go you're gonna train them how to do
83:50
a soul checkup it will change the way
83:52
the body of Christ lives they won't need
83:55
deliverance they won't need six weeks of
83:57
counseling because they won't keep
84:00
anything in them he said and when people
84:03
who do counseling learn to do this those
84:05
people won't have to come back for a
84:07
second visit I have amen I have youth
84:12
centers youth centers youth and by me to
84:17
come and train all their workers how to
84:18
do this and they're crying the entire
84:21
time they say when you youth come to us
84:24
it's on drugs and they're in despair it
84:26
takes it's a year just to get them free
84:29
we'll do in five minutes they can have
84:33
the whole year to get stronger and more
84:36
powerful in God and know who they are
84:38
without carrying that and that's what's
84:41
happening these places are getting
84:43
undone I was shown the future I saw in
84:47
businesses in churches a little thing on
84:49
the door that says soul doctor
84:53
you all need to be so doctors God calls
84:55
me a soul doctor I saw them even
84:59
businesses had them because when people
85:01
get undone or sad or broken you're not a
85:04
good worker you're actually not good for
85:08
much of anything you're in a pitiful
85:11
place I know I worked in a law firm and
85:14
the ones who did the family law the
85:16
divorces and all that stuff like that
85:18
they were always so burdened down
85:20
because they're carrying all that inside
85:22
of them they could be free in five
85:26
minutes
85:28
free from homosexuality we have a young
85:32
person in Lamar Missouri just because
85:36
they lose two from their soul it ran out
85:40
of them and they have never had any of
85:43
those feelings emotions again it is
85:47
powerfullest like you mix the greatest
85:49
deliverance and intercession that you
85:52
could possibly do or look for in the
85:54
earth is available to you personally
85:58
every intercessory group needs to know
86:00
about this it changes the way you pray
86:04
for people how you feel yourself you
86:07
can't carry those burdens I know someone
86:09
who was so burdened down with
86:10
everybody's problems and things you were
86:13
going through she's a powerful woman of
86:14
God it aged her so much she went around
86:17
sad and just broken and I said you
86:19
cannot live like that anymore God didn't
86:22
tell you he had to carry those things
86:23
she loosed him off from her soul and now
86:26
she has a whole new life it will change
86:31
the way we live as the body of Christ
86:32
and the third thing you taught me was
86:35
how to invite heaven's army to be my
86:38
weapon and command the army I don't have
86:42
time to read every scripture that talks
86:45
about us commanding or being commanders
86:47
there are many there are many scriptures
86:51
in the Bible to talk about that I love
86:53
the one where God said come in-you me
86:55
that means you're supposed to be a
86:57
commander that doesn't mean you're gonna
86:58
tell him what to do that means you're
87:00
gonna say what will happen people we
87:03
can't do that what is called those
87:04
things that be not as though they work
87:05
we're saying
87:06
something right there to create
87:08
something right there you should eat the
87:10
works of your mouth you know that that's
87:13
because what you're saying whether good
87:14
or bad is what you're gonna have we're
87:16
already using our mouths to create but
87:20
we need to command command Satan to get
87:23
out of your face get out of your home to
87:26
get out of your finances but we're not
87:29
supposed to fight him our battle is the
87:33
spiritual battle is that true we do not
87:36
wrestle against the flesh but we spend
87:39
so much time fighting each other we
87:42
don't do anything against the enemy amen
87:47
it's really simple there's another
87:51
provision protocol in heaven you have to
87:52
invite we didn't have Christ until we
87:56
invited him is that true amen
87:59
we didn't have Holy Spirit until we
88:02
invited him during 12 us is that true we
88:06
were asking so we received the same
88:11
thing goes for the angelic you have to
88:16
invite them to be your weapon when the
88:19
word says that our weapons they are
88:22
Mahdi it doesn't say it not saying your
88:26
weapon isn't it it says they who are
88:31
they who is created informed by God to
88:35
fight the darkness the army they are our
88:42
weapons who pull down the strongholds of
88:45
darkness around us who shred the
88:48
platforms that demons have been ruling
88:50
from for years but they were not given
88:54
permission to just go attack on the road
88:56
and say they are a military a military
88:59
needs orders
89:02
they need the authority of your person
89:07
giving the orders so who has given
89:10
authority over the darkness
89:12
say it loud so we've been given the
89:17
power say we have a power given to us by
89:22
Christ that is over all the power of the
89:25
enemy
89:28
you can say Christ commanded the host
89:34
even as a righteous man when he's being
89:38
judged by the Sanhedrin he said if I
89:45
wanted to I could call the army of
89:48
heaven to fight on my behalf he was
89:54
showing us we had the right to do that
89:57
so if we have the power over all the
89:59
part of the enemy which by the way we're
90:01
not using it
90:02
or we wouldn't be harmed just to say
90:07
that in the word I'll give you power
90:09
over the brother noon you know I know
90:10
about the stepping on things and all
90:12
that but at the end of it scripture says
90:14
and nothing by any means shall harm you
90:21
Luke 10:19 he wasn't just telling us a
90:27
nice story he was showing us who we were
90:33
so if he did this even walking as a man
90:38
he could come in the hosts are we joint
90:41
heirs did he say what I did you can do
90:44
that gives us permission that gives us
90:48
permission we are not under the Angels
90:52
we are over them we lived in God we are
90:57
his offspring they're not his offspring
90:59
they were all created for a purpose if
91:01
one third of them were created just to
91:04
fight the darkness well it's not in
91:08
heaven no not theirs being threatened
91:12
but he comes here the enemy to kill
91:15
steal and destroy that doesn't mean we
91:19
have to let him
91:23
we are concerned royalty we have a
91:28
kingdom that I'm talking about right now
91:30
living heaven culture is operating in
91:33
the kingdom the pearl of great price
91:36
sell all you have just to get that that
91:39
means give it all up you're flush
91:41
especially yours you're flush your mind
91:44
says stop having to justify everything
91:49
if God's given it to you you just take
91:52
it and then you do it because having
91:57
heavens army to command them the number
92:01
one thing they're going to protect is
92:02
you and I and my husband will testify
92:06
have not been attacked by Satan in six
92:10
years is this true yes it is true
92:14
because why I use the army and I command
92:19
that and when you invite them to be your
92:22
weapon because you have to invite you
92:26
get 100 members of heavens best assigned
92:31
to you and they will live in the sky
92:33
over your home
92:35
they won't come and fight and go back to
92:36
heaven they're being assigned to you
92:40
every King has an army but if that King
92:45
just sat there even in the natural for
92:47
King and then after sat there and did
92:49
nothing with their army they would be
92:50
run over they'd be robbed from they'd be
92:52
killed than having stolen from this is
92:54
this true that's what we've been doing
92:58
that's why we need revelation revelation
93:02
changes everything
93:03
revelation on the Word of God revelation
93:06
honoring God what who he says we are
93:08
revelation on what heaven is what the
93:10
spirit realm is where our rights are
93:12
what our Authority is where our weapons
93:14
are that doesn't mean you don't use the
93:16
blood of Christ the Word of God doesn't
93:19
mean you're not going to use them but
93:20
add this weapon to it
93:22
and this army harkens unto the word of
93:27
the Lord now I know you think that just
93:33
means Jesus Christ
93:35
we are spiritual Lords under the Lord of
93:41
lords and we are kings spiritual kings
93:45
under the King of Kings he didn't write
93:49
down on his side cuz he was talking
93:51
about King David or Solomon it was us in
93:55
this time on the earth literally ruling
93:59
with him we don't have any of that
94:02
authority without him but he gave it to
94:05
us you do really simple you choose with
94:10
your will to invite heaven's army to be
94:11
your weapon and then you thank God and
94:14
then 100 members are signed to you
94:17
immediately and then you learn how to
94:19
send them an assignment you have to give
94:22
them orders you couldn't go to our
94:24
military here and send them some more
94:25
and not have a written out by someone
94:27
who has the authority to give the orders
94:30
and they decide they don't decide I'm
94:33
going to do this order but not that one
94:35
they can't do that oh well we're gonna
94:36
do this but we don't want to do that one
94:38
we're just gonna do this and go back
94:41
their butts would be in trouble they
94:45
would get chewed out they'd have all
94:48
kinds of things assigned to them that
94:49
they don't want to do I'm talking about
94:51
the Earth's military my husband's a
94:54
Marine once a marine always a marine oh
94:56
he had training in Parris Island he
94:58
knows exactly what I'm talking about
95:00
they can't decide to do things on their
95:03
own they have to go to the ones who have
95:06
the authority to give the orders we are
95:12
the only ones who have authority to give
95:13
the orders
95:14
I'm not saying Christ can't be ternoon
95:17
that forever he is now saying as joint
95:19
years you're doing this if you want to
95:21
not be attacked or not harmed or not
95:26
having stolen from you that army will
95:29
keep it from happening they can bring
95:32
back wealth that was kept from you you
95:35
can send them in all the traffic and
95:36
they'll do traffic control and you will
95:38
never have an accident
95:41
never the only time I've ever was when I
95:44
forgot or when he forgot never that's
95:50
part of what they do for you
95:53
amen and then you have to keep doing it
95:57
this isn't a one-time thing you do it
95:59
every day you be strategic make a list
96:01
you know what where do you send them
96:03
wherever the army of darkness is doing
96:08
something especially wherever you go
96:12
send them before you every day even when
96:14
you're on vacation when you're going
96:16
into a meeting to decide if you're gonna
96:18
get the loan or not send the host in
96:20
there to give you favor they'll speak to
96:23
the people like this I like these people
96:25
I'm just gonna say yes I'm really
96:28
serious they will give you favor they
96:31
will open doors for you doesn't this
96:34
sound like a wonderful plan they will
96:39
you can send them to your College your
96:42
students College wreak havoc on health
96:45
what he'll have a bad day let the
96:49
professor's be confounded by the words
96:52
that come out of your child's mouth
96:54
they'll have to give them favor even if
96:56
they don't like them even if they don't
96:57
know them you won't get attacked by
97:01
people bombarding you with hell when you
97:03
go in to sign into the lobby if a people
97:05
used to tell me all the time am I to go
97:06
to the restaurant and get attacked by
97:08
people that the clerk doesn't like me
97:10
that the waitress doesn't like me the
97:12
hotel clerk just crushed me we'll send
97:14
the host before you go in there don't
97:18
ever buy land well setting the host into
97:20
the deal we're sending you I command you
97:23
to go in there you find out anything
97:25
that's not legal that's not right you
97:27
expose it let me know if it's okay I'm
97:30
getting that deal that's why they're
97:33
here who wouldn't want to live like that
97:37
say in heaven they have no problems
97:43
they're never turned on or rejected they
97:47
never have traffic jams everyone chose
97:51
them favor on earth as it is in heaven
97:56
and he even made that possible why not
98:01
30 years ago because this is the time he
98:03
chose to call the kingdom age when we
98:06
would visibly be seen operating in that
98:10
spiritual Kingdom there proof will be
98:12
our life how it is live what we are able
98:15
to have that's the proof it works and I
98:20
had to live every single bit of this
98:22
then I'm telling you if you're married
98:25
this is a free tip please love each
98:30
other
98:30
my husband would laugh every time you'd
98:33
hear me say this and since he knows that
98:36
he really uses it all the time the Holy
98:39
Spirit came to me and he said these were
98:43
lacking anything this is what you do
98:45
when the love goes out the supply comes
98:49
in if you're not loving you're not gonna
98:53
get supply so if you want something love
98:56
even more I'm talking about between
98:57
husband and wife you know what I'm
99:00
talking about say Amen yeah stop making
99:04
war by fighting and start loving and
99:08
make warfare there's like three things I
99:11
have a CD back that are called
99:13
passionate power it is powerful when you
99:18
love one another it's almost the highest
99:19
level of warfare you can make for your
99:21
children for your marriage for your
99:24
finances if you're mad at each other
99:27
loose it from your soul and bind the
99:31
love of God the passion of God for your
99:34
spouse to your soul it'll change your
99:36
marriage in every way all three of these
99:40
things if you live them as a lifestyle
99:42
you will never fail the enemy will be
99:46
terrified at you hell would not want to
99:48
be around you but the host will love
99:51
living with you
99:54
so if you wanted to do that stand up
99:59
leave without that army and I want to
100:02
tell you this you can get strategic and
100:05
make a list and even when the Isis were
100:07
everywhere my favorite thing to do is I
100:10
would command my host to go boating on
100:13
the Strongs the strongholds of Satan
100:15
commanding the ISIS and fear would fall
100:18
on them and then I would say go house
100:21
that the ISIS have a severe crisis and
100:26
they begin to find weapons abandoned in
100:29
the desert in the Mideast they didn't
100:32
know what happened
100:33
the ISIS would drop their weapons and
100:35
run because my host went there they
100:39
pulled down all the demonic controlling
100:42
them it's always about the spirit of
100:44
darkness I didn't fight against the
100:47
flesh I was fighting with the army
100:49
against the spiritual darkness they pull
100:51
down the strongholds those those those
100:53
Isis had no power from Satan because
100:56
they couldn't hear they were removed
100:59
fear and confusion falls on them even in
101:03
games the same thing happens and gangs
101:06
and Marauders and all kinds of drug
101:10
lords and human trafficking everyone
101:12
doing heaven human traffic ministry they
101:14
need to have an army wherever evil is
101:18
you can send them but especially around
101:22
you your household your family your
101:25
close friends I send them all the time
101:27
and the Wyss White House I went there in
101:32
person and I asked for sentinels to be
101:36
posted all the way down Pennsylvania
101:38
Avenue all the way through them all
101:42
through the through the Capitol Hill all
101:44
the way up to the White House to protect
101:47
Trump
101:49
this was before the election and I saw
101:53
them visibly being posted there to
101:57
protect and keep him and his family and
102:00
pens and his family because pence will
102:03
be our president after Tonks terms two
102:07
terms are up and they already have the
102:11
host all around them you can post them
102:15
places and so there's a protocol
102:18
wouldn't you invite them so if you want
102:20
to do that we're going to choose to
102:21
invite them say I choose with my will to
102:26
invite the host of heaven to be my
102:30
mighty weapon I receive them in Jesus
102:35
name Amen
102:38
well now you all have 100 members if
102:42
you're both sided you have 200 if you're
102:46
children I said it with you we have 10
102:48
year olds a command an army from heaven
102:50
10 and 8 year olds that command their
102:53
army is probably into the millions by
102:55
now because they've been doing it for
102:56
years they're growing up knowing these
103:00
truths they lose stuff from their soul
103:02
they asked for grace every morning
103:04
they're living already on earth says
103:06
they live in what are they going to be
103:07
like when they're 40
103:10
relentless against the enemy speaking to
103:15
the mountains and their cast into the
103:17
sea that's what they'll be doing and no
103:21
one can tell them that you can't do that
103:23
they didn't argue in their mind about it
103:26
they didn't say oh no that is not
103:28
scriptural I don't want to write No
103:30
my pastor doesn't teach that no I'm not
103:32
going to do that I don't believe that I
103:33
said you can choose it or you can die
103:36
because then this time there is great
103:39
darkness being loosed on the earth great
103:40
deception great darkness but when you
103:42
live on earth as they live in heaven it
103:44
won't touch you so we are now going to
103:47
send our armies you say Jesus I take
103:56
power over all the power of the enemy
104:01
attacking me my family my household my
104:08
finances my body my destiny I command
104:15
the hosts of heaven to go right now hold
104:22
on every stronghold
104:24
of Darkness shred every platform the
104:29
enemy's been ruling from for years
104:33
against me and my family and I command
104:38
them you trash those demons you bash
104:43
those demons you throw them in a dry
104:46
place and have fun doing it
104:51
go home make toast
104:55
I can tell you they sing they sing while
105:09
they do it
105:10
because they have been waiting for ages
105:12
to do this oh they whistle they whistle
105:21
and if I'm really ticked off with the
105:23
enemy I'll tell them to spit on them and
105:25
then I'll say tell them I sent you
105:29
I wanted them to know that I sent them
105:39
we're supposed to we're supposed to
105:42
commend we are not under hell's foot
105:47
hell is our doormat we are not doormats
105:54
[Applause]
105:56
when it says turn the other cheek that
105:59
doesn't mean you stand and let them beat
106:00
you to the ground
106:01
that means you decide not to blast them
106:04
back God didn't ever say to us tolerate
106:10
sin beating you up I'm talking about
106:12
humans now he never said that and as a
106:14
matter of fact in marriage he never told
106:17
the husband or the wife that you had to
106:20
tolerate sin in their lives they're
106:23
running around if they're beating you
106:25
that is sin he didn't say to submit to
106:29
their sins if they're doing that it's
106:33
okay to leave if it's your property tell
106:36
them to leave
106:37
I had a face-to-face encounter with
106:40
Jesus Christ telling me that I was I was
106:43
married once before a long time ago was
106:45
a big mistake wasn't God's choice
106:47
and for six and a half years I was beat
106:50
up with words and crushed almost to
106:52
nothing and in this is a believer I was
106:55
married to and I never asked God so
106:58
finally he he walks to the wall of my
107:00
been home and says and I finally said to
107:04
God what do I do about it and so he
107:06
walks through the wall he goes now
107:07
you're asking me you're asking me now
107:12
because that was not my choice he said
107:16
so you go break your contract this part
107:19
really surprised me go break your
107:21
contract you made with him because the
107:23
word says what God has joined together
107:27
let not man put asunder it didn't say
107:32
anything about one man put together and
107:37
people are getting married everywhere
107:39
all day no love there's no love a
107:45
covenant is between you and God loving
107:48
one another honoring one another not
107:52
beating some up like a doormat or you
107:54
want to take advantage of them or you
107:56
think they're going to make your life
107:58
easier that is not a wise thing to do
108:00
because your life will be miserable
108:02
it'll be like you're in prison and then
108:04
it will end up being not good at all no
108:08
if you didn't know I can hear people's
108:10
thoughts if you didn't know about that
108:12
and you have a wonderful marriage of
108:13
somebody even if they're not a believer
108:15
then let them remain that's what the
108:18
word says right it's going to honor God
108:21
if they're gonna love you if they're
108:22
going to love you and and you don't have
108:25
they're not sinning all over the place
108:26
then they can state God will accept that
108:29
marriage but for me he had somebody and
108:34
he said this is what the Lord said to me
108:36
if you do not break that contract and
108:38
end that contract and you'll have to go
108:40
repent to him when you said you loved
108:42
him you did those marriage vows you
108:43
didn't mean them you'll have to repent
108:46
and I did I went to repent you see the
108:49
blender at me not him
108:50
do the blender at me and I ended the
108:53
contract and then I didn't want anybody
108:55
I didn't want anybody and God said no I
108:59
have somebody for you
109:01
and is absolutely necessary for you to
109:03
marry them if you're going to complete
109:04
your destiny because with the other one
109:05
you would have never completed it I
109:07
could understand why I wasn't doing
109:10
anything wrong
109:11
I just didn't ask that's an important
109:14
thing to know if it's God amen
109:17
and if you both were not saved at the
109:19
time you got married God will still
109:20
honor that but when you know who better
109:24
and you should have asked so when I met
109:27
him oh man was he good luck oh he still
109:31
is
109:31
we've married 40 years when I met him he
109:40
didn't know who Moses was he didn't
109:44
didn't know anything you probably better
109:46
he didn't have any religious baggage
109:48
number one that's what God said oh no
109:50
he'll become a mighty man of God but you
109:52
are marrying him because you get your
109:54
place where you let God tell you what to
109:56
do if you've died then he tells you what
109:58
to do and if you obey it's gonna be good
110:01
he said no your marrying him I picked
110:03
him when you were still in me you have
110:06
to have him to complete your destiny and
110:08
you will produce holy seed and I need
110:13
that holy seed that's what this is this
110:14
is my conversation with God no you're
110:17
gonna marry him you will have three
110:18
daughters and I need that holy seed in
110:21
the earth so you go tell him yes because
110:25
he wanted six kids and I had told him no
110:27
and I went God said go yep she said go
110:31
do a deal with him he actually did
110:37
he said he loves you so much and will
110:42
always love you so you go do a deal with
110:44
him and you tell him you'll have three
110:46
[Laughter]
110:49
doesn't it sound like a divine thing you
110:54
go tell him you're gonna marry me buddy
110:55
but you'll only have three and they're
110:56
gonna be spread apart and and there was
111:00
one more thing you said to tell him and
111:01
he'll always buy me disposable diapers
111:05
because I had changed diapers on twelve
111:08
of my siblings coming up cloth diapers
111:12
hanging him on the line in Florida where
111:13
I got it would rain every 15 minutes
111:15
they would get mildewed you'd have to
111:17
take them down like eight clotheslines
111:19
I'm talking about eight clothes on
111:21
take them down stick them in a wringer
111:23
washer and right when they go through
111:26
the wringer my brothers are still a bug
111:28
on there I had seven brothers there's
111:32
almost nothing you can say that it's
111:34
going to bother me okay and I had seven
111:38
sisters does a lot of drama he made sure
111:43
I was dead before I left home so I said
111:48
yes and we got married and I I was madly
111:55
in love with him I mean I want to
111:57
encourage everybody here if you've never
111:58
married don't marry do not marry
112:00
somebody you can live with marry someone
112:04
you cannot live without
112:08
the more modest air the more love you
112:12
have each other the greater chance you
112:14
have of it surviving but now that you
112:16
know about loosing from your soul if
112:19
when have you upset each other home in
112:21
the bathroom and loose it all from your
112:22

112:38

113:21
theater like a big theater as part of
113:23
your mansion you'll have Studios to

113:35
every beautiful mansion but your whole
113:38
property if you're gonna have rodeos
113:39

113:41
horses that have learned to buck really
113:44

113:47
will never win with those bowls because
113:49
they'll be yelling you the whole time
113:51
you are not staying on me that isn't
113:56
gonna happen you may have been a
113:58
champion on earth forget it they'll have
114:03
a massive range so I'll have the whole
114:04
thing they'll have the whole ring that
114:06
you have all these things in that's your
114:09
passion if you mean the best barbecue in
114:11
your city you'll have a restaurant and
114:14
serve the best barbecue in heaven it's
114:17
what you've always wanted to do it is
114:19
you well yes is a fisherman oh the
114:25
hunters oh you can still hunt in heaven
114:30
but you do it with like a scope it's a
114:32
camera scope looks like a gun but it's
114:34
just a camera and the way you capture
114:37
something is on the image the image if
114:39
you can see them in the mountain of
114:41
spices you'll go backpacking up there on
114:44
your horses the horses are laughing at
114:46
you the whole time because they know
114:48
you're never gonna find the creatures
114:50
that you're hunting and the creatures if
114:53
they capture you first with the scope
114:56
you go back to their club and there's a
115:00
massive screen like 30 feet 30 feet 30
115:03
feet and there will be your picture and
115:05
then the car will be the creature that
115:07
captured you
115:09
[Applause]
115:12
so nobody guys but it becomes very
115:17
intense extremely and rarely has a human
115:24
being ever captured these creatures and
115:26
so they're determined I'm gonna be the
115:28
first one and they go well I think I got
115:30
some I'm pretty sure I got some yeah
115:32
then you show up and there's your
115:33
picture plastered all over the big train
115:38
heaven is exciting amen
115:43
so I hope you've grown and you've
115:46
learned and you said yes if you do those
115:50
three things then you will live on earth
115:53
that's they live in heaven but it is a
115:55
lifestyle and the more you send the army
115:59
it doesn't have to be just for you
116:01
it can be for family members friends
116:03
missionary groups and if you hear
116:06
something going on if there's a war in
116:07
another country you literally can send
116:09
your army to pull down the darkness
116:11
controlling that whole army and if you
116:13
get people to come together we know
116:15
people who come together once a week and
116:17
strategically send their armies together
116:19
it's devastating it's devastating the
116:23
hell's planes amen
116:25
the more you sound the more you get they
116:30
get multiplied like you don't get
116:32
another hundred if you've been sending
116:34
them for a whole week you'll get 10,000
116:36
then it goes to a million and I've been
116:40
doing it probably around five years or
116:41
so I have 33 billion that I send
116:47
everywhere all the time
116:49
I do sweeps of host states to expose
116:52
every every group of human trafficking
116:55
drug trafficking violence witchcraft
116:59
whatever it is I send them they do is
117:02
sweep cuz I'm gonna make Florida a
117:05
region of light
117:07
[Applause]
117:08
Colorado yeah
117:12
Bessie Denver's ending in the Denver all
117:14
the time you can even send them into the
117:17
laws that they're gonna make that you
117:20
don't want or even after they have been
117:22
made the hosts can go influence the
117:27
people who are over those laws or they
117:29
can expose all the crime that's being
117:32
done because of those laws and they'll
117:35
realize we should have never done this
117:36
you can use it in Congress in your own
117:40
city government in the state government
117:42
and I certainly sent them throughout the
117:46
entire election and the midterm
117:50
elections end every voting booth to
117:55
speak to the people in the voting booth
117:58
they vote for life freedom and justice
118:03
and they will go and they'll come back
118:08
quickly so be strategic the more you
118:11
send the more you get amen and and they
118:14
know it works and we get things from all
118:18
over the world the people that are doing
118:19

122:50
everywhere you go don't forget to send
122:54
them against darkness every day of your
122:56
life don't forget to ask for grace and
122:59
don't keep anything in you that you
123:02
don't want so let's stand up it'll be
123:04
the last thing we do we're gonna have a
123:06
soul checkup right now we're gonna get
123:11
it done it's like anything else you have
123:15
to choose with your will to do this and
123:18
we know people I tried it didn't work I
123:20
said you didn't really mean it
123:21
they're wanting to be free from
123:23
cigarettes and you can be we've had a
123:25
lot of people be free from that but they
123:27
still wanted them and they still smoked
123:30
them and what well you know if you want
123:33
to give it up you're actually supposed
123:34
to say no if that comes back to you and
123:37
the enemy will try you you just say no
123:39
and so I said well I'm still not sure
123:41
about that but we've had a lot of people
123:43
set free from all kinds of things like
123:45
we talked about including homosexuality
123:47
which is not of God it's the devil
123:50
perverting the image of God because we
123:53
are made in His image
123:55
everyone in Genesis 1:26 was the
123:58
everyone God ever made we were made in
124:01
His image and after his likeness so
124:05
anything that doesn't line up with that
124:06
is something that Satan got into he
124:10
wants to destroy images he wants to
124:11
destroy destinies and I pray they
124:14
actually call me they call me and ask me
124:16
how to be free and they go even though I
124:19
say this is okay I'm talking about the
124:20
homosexuals even though I will tell
124:22
people I love this and I'm doing great
124:24
they're not they said I suffer inside my
124:27
soul fights with me all the time I don't
124:31
know why it fights and when it because
124:33
God put things in you before he sent you
124:36
and it's not agreeing with what you're
124:39
choosing and they said well no I mean I
124:42
really want to go to heaven cuz even
124:44
though I say this is OK inside I know
124:47
it's not OK so no matter what they say
124:50
they know deep inside it's not it's not
124:53
right and so I just take him through the
124:55
word about showing them about the image
124:57
of God and and how he lived in God and
124:59
what his plans are for us and they get
125:01
saved they pray and they get saved
125:03
and then they loosen because then it
125:06
never they don't feel like that anymore
125:07
amen
125:08
so we're gonna choose to lose all kinds
125:11
of things from our soul and then when
125:13
we're done with that we will bind the
125:15
things of God to our soul and you can
125:17
say you had a soul checkup
125:18
but you can actually teach other people
125:20
how to do soul checkups especially
125:23
people you know that are broken are
125:24
really sad they're in fear they need to
125:27
loose that from their self almost
125:28
everything being displayed from people
125:30
99% of the time it is what is in their
125:33
soul as you think it's in your soul so
125:38
are you so people are angry all the time
125:40
or they're in fear they feel unworthy
125:43
unworthiness you know they could have a
125:46
spirit of infirmity you can even lose
125:49
them from your soul and they'll be gone
125:52
so we're gonna say I choose as an act to
125:56
my will and a child of God I lose for my
126:02
soul
126:04
all fear all anger all unworthiness all
126:12

131:14
God right now if you did that every day
131:18
of your life what would happen you would
131:24
be walking on air that's when the
131:29
greater works if you weren't here the
131:33
other day I talked about how that
131:34
actually just happened to me in Reno of
131:36
all places
131:37
and Reno I just stepped off of the stuff
131:40
and didn't realize it and I literally
131:42
walk down there about this far off the
131:44
ground my sisters like freaking out
131:46
behind me no Mike I'm what I'm like I
131:52
look Turnham like I was standing on air
131:54
and so I say to the father Wow father is
131:59
that as good as walking on water and he
132:02
goes no it's a greater work water you
132:06
can feel the air you can't feel he said
132:12
you better get used to that because
132:15
you'll be doing it it's a manifested
132:18
daughter of God amen if you see the
132:22
rainbow coming out of your head that's
132:24
the image of God if your eyes become
132:27
flames of fire that's the Lord's image
132:30
and the father's image if you have
132:34
gemstones appear on your skin which
132:36
might sound weird you but everybody in
132:39
heaven wears them on them they come from
132:44
the Father they come from his heart he
132:47
has them all so it's one of his images
132:51
gemstones in heaven are so extremely
132:54
valuable because they all come from the
132:55
heart of God they're put on your robes
132:58
of righteousness there in your walkways
133:00
up to you of your home I was in
133:02
someone's home and I saw massive
133:03
gemstones which was what they were they
133:05
had on the on their table as decorations
133:08
decor for this table that probably
133:10
seated like I don't know I've been in
133:12
homes
133:13
a hundred people the dining room I'm
133:15
talking about in someone's home but I've
133:17
been in one even bigger than that
133:19
this one had about baby 460 people and
133:21
the drapes on the windows were so sheer
133:24
they were moving they were living and
133:26
they had pearls this big on the end of
133:28
all the drapes their chandelier was 50
133:31
feet long in their dining room and it
133:35
was real gemstones all from the heart of
133:37
God and their glory was reflected
133:40
because all over the ground reflects the
133:42
glory the sky has the glory the
133:45
buildings are filled with the glory of
133:46
God if you walk and live in the glory of
133:49
God you live you live in the glory down
133:57
here we are practicing because up there
134:01
it will be your life you come in your
134:05
mansion and the mansion will speak to
134:07
you and say welcome home even your
134:13
mansion knows you knows your name the
134:16
disciples will come and greet you
134:18
they'll come and move in for a while
134:19
King David will come and take you in his
134:22
own chariot across the skies of heaven
134:24
on a tour of heaven you go see Paul who
134:27
sits in this garden all the time and all
134:29
you're talking about is the epistles but
134:31
when he gives the epistles he's given
134:32
what happened in the spirit realm your
134:34
HOH testimony changes because you get to
134:36

00:00
[Music]
00:03
everyone this is my husband captain me
00:16
first time he's been here I'm excited
00:19
man
00:25
can you hear me
00:28
[Music]
00:34
make sure this is on
00:36
it's on now I just had to push that back
00:39
nine
00:40
okay we're on well the time of my
00:45
message tonight is time for freedom if
00:50
you wonder why all the time a lot of
00:53
confirmations on that from God he said
00:55
it's time for freedom so that's the
00:57
title of the message for us to operate
01:00
your freedom in our own personal lives
01:03
and our country especially in America it
01:08
is time for freedom for the body of
01:10
Christ it is time for freedom it's the
01:15
time to rule and freedom amen because we
01:21
all know that the truth will make us
01:24
[Music]
01:27
free indeed and that's really what time
01:31
it is in our lives and especially all
01:34
those who came here tonight you will
01:36
leave with a deposit of heavens freedom
01:39
in you amen and my notebook is blank
01:46
it's here to hang on to I guess I tell
01:51
people if you're gonna talk about having
01:53
an you've been there you don't need
01:54
notes because you will never forget it
01:57
never if you had a dream so vivid ten
02:01
years later you remember if it was in
02:03
heaven then you probably were there a
02:05
lot of people don't know you're taking
02:07
even in your sleep your spirit man can
02:10
be taken in your sleep and that dream is
02:12
so vivid you recount everything about it
02:14
what it felt like the music the aromas
02:18
the experience of just touching heavens
02:20
ground being in the throne room a lot of
02:24
places in heaven and heaven is coming
02:27
and invading this earth
02:30
you know the body will pick up and hear
02:33
something from heaven and they'll say
02:35
that for years and then it actually
02:37
happens and so this is the time for it
02:40
to happen
02:41
heaven is converging with this earth
02:44
that means a lot will change in our
02:46
lives that means we need to start living
02:48
on earth like they live in heaven that's
02:51
called heaven culture heaven has their
02:53
own culture trust me every when you move
02:56
there they know that their life is
02:59
radically different and their existing
03:03
to live down here we have to kind of
03:07
exist sometimes except in this time we
03:09
actually can live in the past you know
03:11
you have to take have a living in your
03:14
life in order to exist you had to make a
03:16
living right but in this time it's time
03:19
to exist to live if we can live on this
03:23
earth like they do in heaven and heaven
03:25
is invading this earth and are all of
03:27
our senses are being brought alive
03:29
moving into manifest and I'm sitting
03:31
there and God says there'll be
03:32
manifestation and demonstration there'll
03:36
be signs and wonders you know there's
03:38
all kinds of things that they're saying
03:40
about this time on the earth and we
03:42
should all be able to experience them
03:44
and actually help make them happen you
03:49
know when Christ was here he was a
03:51
living example for the disciples he was
03:54
training them the whole time he walked
03:57
in his life those last three years of
03:59
his life everything you did or said that
04:01
was training for the disciples well I
04:04
come to Train I'm not here to give you a
04:08
nice word I'm not here to give a nice
04:10
message that might tickle you a little
04:12
bit I'm here to change you to Revelation
04:17
manifestation demonstration signs and
04:21
wonders and I know some of that will
04:24
come from heaven itself but really it's
04:26
because heaven is invading us it's us we
04:29
it is our turn right now to manifest for
04:33
heaven in this earth you know we're
04:35
putting on the show say we're putting on
04:37
a show
04:38
and the show has begun we are the third
04:43
show the first one was the father the
04:48
second one was Christ in hell on the
04:51
third day well we are the third show
04:53
being put on in this earth amen he's
04:56
going to show up and show off in us that
05:00
is a show so if you had if you had a lot
05:06
of showman in you you're ready you are
05:09
so ready a lot of the body has to be
05:12
transitioned into being a very open
05:14
person expressive person doesn't matter
05:17
what anyone says or you know sees about
05:20
them
05:20
God isn't hiding us anymore he's not
05:25
hiding us time for the body of Christ to
05:28
come out of the closet and let the world
05:34
see us operating on the stoats just like
05:38
they do in heaven we're supposed to
05:41
manifest the image of the Living God and
05:44
if you're ready for that you should be
05:47
saying to the father I want to look like
05:50
you and act like you and singing to his
05:53
son I want to look like you and act like
05:56
you and even the Holy Spirit I want to
05:59
look like you and act like you we will
06:03
fulfill Genesis 1:26 what God said let
06:07
us make man in our image there you go
06:10
look like them and operate like them
06:13
their likeness is how they operate
06:17
that's revelation on that scripture
06:20
people think why are they saying the
06:21
same thing twice they're not when you
06:24
begin to understand heavens language
06:26
they can say something to something
06:28
similar to the next word but those are
06:30
always going to be two different things
06:31
their image and their likeness are two
06:35
different things
06:36
their likeness is literally how they
06:40
operate so worse was the operating on
06:44
this earth on this earth like they are
06:46
in heaven that means you may have a
06:49
manifestation
06:50
manifestation is something supernatural
06:52
that people haven't seen before coming
06:55
from you
06:56
I have already had four manifestations
07:03
knew never done before coming from me as
07:06
demonstration of the Living God just
07:10
because I started telling him I want to
07:13
look just like you
07:14
so they've seen the rainbow moving in
07:17
and out of my head say God as the
07:21
father's image isn't it they've seen
07:27
that they've seen my eyes become flames
07:30
of fire amen like my pupils are flames
07:34
of fire and this was just in the last
07:37
few months this has started happening
07:38
and the third thing is that I was just
07:44
in my products table like saying hi to
07:46
people and the father had warned me at
07:48
any time because they gave permission I
07:52
want you all to say this I give
07:53
permission anytime anywhere you want to
08:00
you may demonstrate through me and I yes
08:06
you need to mean that when you say that
08:10
father anytime anywhere you choose I
08:19
give you permission to demonstrate
08:24
through me
08:26
who you are and Jesus Christ I give you
08:31
permission Holy Spirit I give you
08:35
permission to demonstrate and manifest
08:40
through me your image and the way you
08:44
operate so be it
08:47
I receive it amen I'm gonna take a
08:55
minute and remind you of some of the
08:58
things some of the images that Christ
09:00
took on this earth his eyes were flames
09:04
of fire he walked on water he made food
09:08
created food amen he traveled in the
09:12
spirit realm and controlled time because
09:15
it's Ellery them they stepped in the
09:17
boat they were there that's one of the
09:21
things that he did is one of the ways he
09:23
operated he raised the dead even after
09:26
they were stinking he terrified the
09:31
demonic all the time
09:34
amen he walked on water are you willing
09:42
to do that the Holy Spirit the Holy
09:48
Spirit one of his images is littered
09:50
becoming a flame of fire it was a flame
09:54
of fire that couldn't be quenched
09:55
couldn't put out he showed up in the
09:57
upper room and boy did he have drama
10:03
drama comes with him he is called the
10:06
drama king in heaven just wait and see
10:10
what's going to happen he was invisible
10:16
everybody say
10:19
one of the ways he operated yet he had
10:23
many things that represented him in his
10:26
image that he used in this earth a man
10:28
and the father the living rainbow moving
10:34
in and out of him it's not just a
10:38
rainbow it's alive moves in and out like
10:40
this in waves all the time in heaven in
10:44
and out of him that's who John saw in
10:46
the book of Revelation in chapter 4 he
10:50
saw him sitting on the throne with a
10:52
rainbow like unto an emerald you notice
10:57
he didn't say just like an emerald
10:59
because he didn't have a word for teal
11:04
teal is the father's favorite color and
11:09
those bands coming out of him can be
11:12
like that can be one full band that goes
11:15
from him to the walls of the throne room
11:17
it could be like red or blue or blue
11:21
green teal it could be purple it can be
11:25
blue and a red mixed together whenever
11:28
those rainbow that rainbow comes out of
11:30
him when you're in the throne room you
11:32
could have been there seven different
11:33
times and that rainbow was a different
11:35
color every time everyone in this in the
11:38
throne room would turn that color it
11:41
would saturate them and turn them that
11:43
color say that's the father's image
11:52
there are cosmic waves I call cosmic
11:55
waves like I think to me the biggest
11:57
greatest thing is like cosmic it's
12:00
bigger than all the cosmos out there he
12:03
has waves to come through from him love
12:06
I'm telling you the greatest love come
12:09
from him and then the glory when the
12:11
glory comes you hear it has a frequency
12:14
the love and and the glory of God and
12:17
the peace of God they have a frequency
12:20
that comes with him and I've been in
12:22
there before one like this wave like
12:24
continue like a shock wave would come
12:26
from him and it would go like mmm mmm I
12:30
can't even make the sound it was so loud
12:32
and it would penetrate everybody in
12:34
there all the way around him and they
12:36
would get they would get thrown to the
12:37
floor that's that's one of the ways he
12:41
operates it is he also has flames of
12:46
fire his flames the fire are blue his
12:48
pupils are literally flames of fire and
12:51
the glory comes something so great if
12:54
you stand in front of him long enough
12:56
you'll see these flames of fire that are
12:58
his eyes it's one of his images so all
13:04
these amazing images are these images in
13:07
the way they operate from the father
13:08
from his son from the holy spirit he is
13:12
a whirlwind I've seen him come in many
13:14
times as a whirlwind sometimes he was a
13:17
whirlwind of the rainbow and he come and
13:20
he he would be like you know kind of
13:22
invisible but he's actually big he's
13:24
actually got a body arms legs a head or
13:27
you wouldn't have one they all do the
13:31
Father the Son Holy Spirit all have an
13:33
actual body because we're made in there
13:37
or you wouldn't have on those images are
13:44
manifested in different ways and of
13:46
course the Holy Spirit also in the image
13:49
of a dove that was not just a little
13:52
dove with feathers that Dove had
13:55
feathers what were made out of flames
13:56
the fire when he came down and was over
14:00
Christ when John was going to baptize
14:03
him
14:03
remember when he baptized him and that
14:05
dove came down and then they heard the
14:07
voice of the Father declaring who his
14:11
son was and he was pleased in him and so
14:15
they have a voice there's another thing
14:17
about their voice haven't experienced
14:19
that yet I've heard it when it talks in
14:22
the Bible that it was sounded like many
14:24
thunders or many waters because they
14:28
didn't have like today's language to
14:31
interpret that he has his voice is
14:34
layered there's layers in his voice
14:38
that's why it sounds like many many
14:40
thunders or many waters he literally has
14:43
layers in his voice expect that to
14:44
happen to you one day when you get up to
14:46
speak and people are shook they're just
14:49
shook to the core when the hearing
14:50
speaking is like layered like many
14:53
saying it instead of one this is his
14:57
this is one of the images this is this
14:59
is one of the images that they and the
15:00
likeness that they operate in so if
15:02
we're supposed to be just like them you
15:04
better be ready for any of these things
15:05
to manifest to you okay just the works
15:10
of Christ was shocking to people but the
15:13
greater works then he is reserved for
15:16
this time there's time again this is a
15:21
different time if you've never heard
15:24
that said you're not living in the same
15:27
spiritual time that we did even a few
15:30
years ago because I've been talking
15:33
about this for a lot of years a lot of
15:37
many years I've been talking about all
15:39
this happening and you know but God has
15:41
on this timeline a time when that starts
15:44
and we're not waiting on that time
15:47
anymore we are in that time we're in
15:51
that time where we will stand out and
15:53
stand up and show off
15:56
you can you stayed up and you can you
15:58
know you need to wake up and stand up
16:00
and that's nice
16:03
but standing out and showing off is a
16:06
whole different thing that's when you
16:08
can't hide and you'll never be able to
16:11
hide again because God has marked you
16:15
for greatness if you're alive in this
16:19
time even those who don't know him you
16:22
know some of them are marked for
16:23
greatness and so we need to believe and
16:26
have faith and hope for everybody no
16:29
matter how wicked they are God right now
16:32
in this time is moving on the hearts of
16:36
very wicked people he really is and you
16:42
may not see Christ coming from them at
16:45
the time but you'll see a major change
16:46
in the way that they talk and they live
16:50
like the North Korean president
16:58
if people don't realize there is a major
17:00
change in that man that didn't just
17:07
happen for any reason that was God's
17:09
plan he had a plan I'll either change
17:14
him or remove him off the face of the
17:15
earth and many leaders and countries
17:19
right now are in that place because God
17:22
is trying to align as many countries as
17:25
he can to agree with his plan and those
17:29
countries will prosper beyond measure
17:32
because they've heard him and they are
17:35
shifting God is right now shifting she's
17:40
shifting governments to shape that
17:42
nation Korea is going to be shaped by
17:46
God by God as America is right now we're
17:53
being shifted right now do you haven't
17:57
noticed
17:59
in the shifting process all of Hell will
18:02
be exposed people no matter how high up
18:11
the ladder they have gotten if they're a
18:14
wicked if they have a wicked agenda and
18:16
they've been hiding it it will be
18:18
exposed and those who are in leadership
18:23
or in our government or even in big
18:26
business this includes big business - it
18:28
even includes the church those who are
18:32
hiding lying sinning and thinking that
18:36
they could stand here and give the Word
18:39
of God and speak on his behalf if they
18:41
think they can do that anymore not in
18:43
this time they will not and the Spirit
18:47
of God is really moving on the hearts of
18:49
those that are doing it so they don't
18:51
die I'm just as serious about that is
18:57
all the rest because there this is a
19:00
time that's so important to God that
19:02
he's removing all the roadblocks he's
19:05
removing all of the weights anything
19:08
that has held us back to be able to
19:10
prosper to have a voice to have a
19:12
platform everywhere to speak on his
19:15
behalf whether is the business arena the
19:17
governmental arena arts and
19:19
entertainment arena news and media arena
19:21
he's moving on the hearts of people and
19:23
he is shifting even in those different
19:26
arenas you're gonna see major changes in
19:31
all of those arenas when God's gonna do
19:35
something new he always sends a a
19:37
messenger or messengers and they have
19:41
revelation in them the messenger if it's
19:45
about heaven or time or God they have to
19:48
have revelation in them that's not
19:51
something that came from their own mind
19:53
never in my life did I set a time
19:56
thinking I was gonna do any of this I
19:59
had my plan
20:02
me Father Son and Holy Spirit and a nice
20:07
little you know executive apartment
20:09
somewhere moving and shaking the
20:11
business world that was my plan so what
20:15
does he do
20:16
remove me totally completely out of the
20:18
business world well that took that off
20:20
his plan off my plan my plan that was
20:23
gone it was just gonna be me did you get
20:25
that me not a husband not children me
20:30
father said in Holy Spirit
20:32
well that was wiped off you know that
20:34
was quite tough of my plan I obviously
20:36
got married I I have three beautiful
20:42
children that God said they were holy
20:46
seed and he informed me because a long
20:51
time ago I gave him my life he informed
20:54
me you are marrying him he did not ask
20:59
me when you get the place what God is
21:02
telling you that is significant because
21:06
you're not going to fight against your
21:07
gonna say okay yeah I gave you a
21:08
permission which you did tonight and he
21:14
started a 40-year plan on me to prepare
21:18
me for what he was gonna do with me he
21:20
even took me out of my wonderful job I
21:23
had there was high paying and I loved it
21:28
so I thought well you know I'm married
21:30
but I can still work in the business
21:31
world and I loved it I've worked over 25
21:34
years in the business world well he
21:35
wiped that off from my plan by getting
21:38
me fired
21:41
he's gonna make sure I left but he was
21:45
kind enough to tell me 30 days before it
21:48
happened in 30 days you will not be
21:51
working there anymore I was working in a
21:55
law at a nice job with a Christian
21:58
lawyer which was a miracle Oh a
22:01
Christian comedian lawyer which was a
22:03
double miracle so I had a lot of fun I
22:07
love my job enjoyed it didn't know a
22:09
thing about law but was trained in
22:11
business law estate and probate and tax
22:15
law and real estate which I didn't know
22:17
a thing about it and he still hired me
22:18
that's called favor that's also called
22:22
God's plan so he really did he got me
22:26
and shifted me everywhere and then I had
22:30
my three daughters that was a big
22:33
surprise but he also told me that you're
22:38
gonna marry him you'll have a three
22:40
girls and I need them all so you will
22:45
say yes to him because I would say nope
22:46
see one at six
22:51
and I am one of 15 at the not the very
22:56
top if you've never been part of a big
22:58
family especially one of the older ones
23:00
you don't know what dying is you die
23:04
every day so I hope to raise 12 of my
23:07
siblings and now he's telling me
23:10
remember my plan no husband no children
23:13
just the Trinity and me doing big
23:16
business together and he informed me
23:21
each of these times because from the
23:23
time I was young I could hear him well
23:25
but the more I gave myself to him and
23:27
the more I chose his will his way and
23:32
obey I will tell you right now a very
23:36
important keys right his will his way
23:40
not yours a lot of people on his will
23:43
they do it their way it takes longer
23:46
it'll slow things down you may have to
23:49
start all over again sometimes so I
23:51
decided I'm doing it I'm gonna have I
23:53
want your will your way and then I had
23:56
to obey even when it didn't make sense
23:59
and I promise you he is almost never
24:02
going to make sense one of my friends
24:07
recently made a statement she she
24:09
preaches a lot her family have like
24:11
seven churches everywhere and she's
24:14
blocked so she's got a lot of layers in
24:16
her soul she's extremely expressed that
24:19
she's a lot of fun but she will tell you
24:20
the way it is let me tell you she said
24:23
God always ask you to do things crazy
24:27
things he lets you do crazy things that
24:31
don't make any sense to you but yes for
24:33
the crazy things so that it can bring
24:35
the supernatural what usually doesn't
24:39
make any sense either and I promise you
24:43
she was right on when she said that it's
24:46
almost always crazy doesn't make any
24:48
sense because he is not a man he has his
24:53
own plan right so here is after saying
24:58
all that in all these years he then
24:59
began to tell me okay right now you're
25:01
marrying him you're gonna have three
25:03
girls you can have them five years apart
25:04
if you want to but you're gonna have
25:05
them and then as a baby he showed me the
25:10
destiny of each one of them I saw what
25:14
they would be doing I know what they'll
25:16
be doing for a very long time in their
25:18
in their life need some water
25:22
I'll talk to nothing comes out I don't
25:28
want to waste time so Jesus as one of
25:34
the way he operates he wasn't that
25:36
bombed by time even as a righteous man
25:38
and I like to remind everybody yes he
25:40
was the son of God but he walked and
25:42
lived as a righteous man just like you
25:46
he had to face everything you faced he
25:49
had to make decisions how he was gonna
25:51
respond react what he was gonna allow in
25:53
his soul but he wouldn't allow in his
25:55
soul that he would love instead of hate
25:58
he didn't sin he didn't sin he said no
26:02
to sin he had absolute authority and
26:05
power over all the power of the enemy
26:07
that's why he could give it to us he
26:11
would command the heavens to open did
26:14
you hear me say the word command say a
26:17
righteous man commanded the heavens to
26:21
open and he did that more than once
26:26
are we righteous can we command did he
26:32
command the hosts of heaven that's
26:34
another way he operated the hosts of
26:36
heaven are the armies of heaven and he
26:40
even said when he was on trial if I
26:43
wanted to I could call the army of
26:45
heaven to come and fight on my behalf
26:46
did he say that say as a righteous man
26:50
he said that he commanded when he was on
26:56
this earth he commanded the water to
26:59
turn into wine and that was not normal
27:03
wine he commanded the water to turn into
27:06
heavens wine when that be great for some
27:13
people
27:17
he did that all the time because it
27:19
reminded him of home heavens wine is the
27:24
best wine and that's why they said at
27:27
the wedding you have saved the best for
27:31
last
27:32
never have we ever had wine like this
27:34
before never yeah because it didn't come
27:37
from Earth it came from heaven and have
27:42
news for you Jesus did that at home all
27:43
the time
27:44
that's why Mary knew he could do it
27:48
right she knew that he could turn that
27:52
water into heavens wine he did it when
27:55
he was growing up nobody was ever sick
28:03
in his home while he was there the food
28:06
would all be always be multiplied on the
28:08
table he already operated in these
28:11
things and he knew one day he would step
28:14
out and do them remember what Mary said
28:17
go do whatever he says to do and Jesus
28:20
said are you making me step up before my
28:21
time no Mary knew it was time and when
28:26
they came for him remember when he's
28:27
preaching somewhere and they said your
28:29
mother and your siblings are outside
28:31
asking for you they were not asking him
28:34
to come home and preach say Amen or he
28:40
would have been they would have already
28:41
been in the meetings they missed heavens
28:45
wine they missed the food be multiplied
28:48
they missed
28:49
never been sick because of his presence
28:53
these are things he had to learn and
28:55
grow when he grew up in these but there
28:59
came a time in his life when he knew
29:00
exactly who he was he knew his purpose
29:04
from the earth he had to say yes like we
29:08
had to say yes he had to choose to do
29:12
these things you have to choose to be
29:14
chosen many are called but few are
29:19
chosen because they don't say yes to
29:23
being chosen
29:24
that's why I always say say I'll receive
29:27
it because when you say I received it
29:28
that means you're saying yes I want to
29:29
be chosen I had to choose even though he
29:33
was telling me what to do I still had to
29:35
choose to do I had to obey and the Bible
29:39
says those who are willing and she'll
29:42
eat the fatter the it's a promise in
29:47
this time it's really important to make
29:50
sure that you obey even if it doesn't
29:53
make sense and so I told you there were
29:57
four things he started manifesting in me
29:59
the fourth thing the fourth thing
30:01
happened last weekend when I was in Reno
30:06
Reno Nevada I walked on air remember how
30:13
they operate Jesus walked on water I
30:16
walked on the air and I was quite
30:20
shocked and my sister was behind me we
30:25
were going to the greenroom the pastor
30:27
was in front of me to head into the
30:28
green room and I didn't know that there
30:30
was a drop a step this big come to in
30:33
something there's a big step and then
30:34
you've stepped down I didn't see the
30:35
step I just was going because he was
30:38
beacon to me as he was going forward I'm
30:40
speaking to him while he's walking we're
30:42
both talking to each other and I stepped
30:44
off to step into nothing and it felt
30:49
like nothing if you stepped in water you
30:52
would at least feel the water so I
30:56
stepped off and I kept going and then I
30:58
stepped off with my other foot and I'm
31:00
there and I'm your sister like gas
31:02
behind me and and now we're so shocked
31:05
when I look down on this far off the
31:07
floor in the air this is what is going
31:13
to happen to you
31:18
and if you remember even as even at the
31:22
very end of G's Minh when everything was
31:24
done and he was going to go home
31:25
remember he just went up in the air
31:28
Jesus just went up in the air didn't he
31:30
say he walked down there right before
31:34
mine home so I'm just standing there and
31:38
I'm I said to the father
31:40
this is Myall and when is this sort of I
31:46
actually in my mind was speaking him and
31:48
he was answering me my mind and went is
31:50
this like walking on water he goes oh no
31:52
this is better
31:55
he said when Peter stepped out of the
31:57
boat he could feel the water you aren't
32:00
feeling anything and he said by the way
32:03
you better get used to this like
32:06
whatever you want and so my sister's
32:09
like yeah I'm standing on the urine
32:18
aperture on look at her wonder Stan yeah
32:20
yeah in her face is like and I actually
32:27
dropped my iPad I was so so startled and
32:30
at this point the passage around he goes
32:32
what's going on and the mini said that
32:35
my feet just on the floor and I'm like
32:39
that didn't bother me at all and Django
32:41
you know said why don't you just say I
32:43
was walking on it that sounds a little
32:45
bit better than flow I guess it always
32:48
both okay that was say a manifestation
32:52
of the power of God so all for these
32:58
things that have just started happening
33:00
is because I gave him permission I gave
33:04
him permission now he didn't warn me and
33:07
say oh in the minute you're gonna just
33:09
step on you're gonna walk on there he
33:12
didn't warn me about any of these he
33:13
didn't say oh by the way rainbow is
33:15
gonna start coming out of your head
33:17
moving in and out of your head
33:19
and and I've actually had a few people
33:22
together that saw another person he was
33:24
visiting and they were just talking to
33:25
me and I'm
33:26
in the middle of this kitchen and they
33:28
keep going like this like the tryna
33:30
mommy and I'm like what's wrong he goes
33:33
you have a rainbow that's like coming in
33:37
and out of your hat she tried to look to
33:40
see if it was the lights or was 7
33:41
reflecting and I'm he goes no it's the
33:43
rainbow
33:44
about an hour later he goes there's that
33:46
rainbow again I just totally ignored I
33:48
ignored him you know I thought well I
33:50
don't know what he ate for dinner but
33:52
maybe he's tired
33:54
and then the next weekend I went to a
33:57
church and was speaking and one thing
34:00
God the Father told me personally Jesus
34:03
and the father both told me that at one
34:04
point everybody in the meeting would see
34:06
the angels that are with me because
34:09
we're going to see heaven say we're
34:11
going to see heaven lots of heaven you
34:16
come in one day and see all the angels
34:18
waiting you see yours that came with you
34:20
okay and if any I'm coming to do
34:24
something for heaven Oh God
34:26
then you'll see them too in your mind
34:30
you have to stop thinking that you're
34:33
normal we are not like all the people on
34:39
the earth don't have Jesus their DNA has
34:43
not been changed but yours has and the
34:51
other thing too you better get ready for
34:52
as you actually do have power yourself
34:56
people oh that sounds just too oh no you
35:02
have power yet power because Jesus said
35:07
we did he actually gave it to us all
35:12
these are in the Word of God okay you
35:15
just maybe didn't know that you were
35:17
born in the right time the time that
35:20
you're born in is very strategic for God
35:22
and he will wait to a certain event
35:26
happens when an event happens a fullness
35:29
of time has come and when a bonus of
35:32
timing has come that means things will
35:35
be different in the earth that's also
35:38
scriptural
35:39
a fullness of time has come that means
35:42
the old stuff isn't going to be like
35:43
totally gone away but the way we operate
35:46
will be greater and more powerful than
35:48
the way we used to operate in the old
35:50
time and when when John the Baptist made
35:53
that announcement that certainly a
35:55
fullness of time had come
35:56
amen upon the time came when Christ was
36:00
born in the earth another fullness of
36:01
time came when he was going to step up
36:03
into his ministry was crucified on the
36:06
cross that was another time because
36:09
things would change things change when
36:12
Christ was born and things changed when
36:17
he stepped into his ministry and things
36:19
changed when he was crucified on the
36:21
cross and was rose from the dead major
36:24
changes were made this is the time this
36:28
is the time for the body the manifested
36:32
say manifested sons and daughters to
36:37
stand up and manifest in this earth say
36:43
the earth is crying out and it's shaking
36:46
in travail for us to stand up and speak
36:52
to the earth speak to the air speak to
36:57
the hosts for the impossible to happen
37:03
amen
37:04
the earth is not shaking because it is
37:08
the end and everything is going to be
37:09
all over the people who don't know God's
37:14
timing say it is and all the people in
37:17
the church who don't know this is
37:19
sitting on the rapture rugs because they
37:24
want to escape because it's so awful
37:26
well they will be sitting there forever
37:30
these are some of the greatest times on
37:33
the earth that God has written down and
37:35
he's not going to ignore them but he
37:38
expects us to participate
37:41
not escape participate don't escape
37:46
there's another t-shirt and so many of
37:53
the body think is so horrible and awful
37:56
they can't even when you get stuck in
37:58
that place you can't see the good that
38:00
is happening you have filled your soul
38:03
your own soul with doom and gloom wrath
38:08
and destruction and you can't even see
38:10
or understand this is the day of his
38:12
power not the day of his wrath those are
38:16
two different times we're in the last
38:20
days because we're a lot closer than we
38:22
were thousands of years ago we're in the
38:27
last days but not the last day and major
38:31
things will happen a lot of things have
38:33
to happen before the end of time comes
38:37
many many many things we'll be seeing it
38:41
doing it experiencing it but we aren't
38:45
going to escape it you either you either
38:48
feel it and watch it and sit on the
38:51
sidelines or you'll be in it I'm going
38:54
to be in it
38:56
amen so America right now is in it
39:03
America hasn't been brushed to the side
39:05
by god it's a baby nation it's one of
39:11
the it's one of the youngest nations in
39:12
the earth I mean there's I've recently
39:15
visited nations that were thousands of
39:17
years old I've been to them recently and
39:20
I come back here and there's no place
39:23
like here maybe Israel Israel was
39:28
powerful is a beautiful place filled
39:34
with the Spirit of God millions of
39:37
angels are in Israel they still stand in
39:40
the place where Christ knelt in the
39:41
garden had to drink that cup they're
39:44
still in the upper room and I already
39:46
seen the fiery open we're opening in the
39:48
upper room where the Holy Spirit came in
39:50
and anointed all them and the Holy Ghost
39:53
they're still there they're there even
39:57
over Paul's where he was held in prison
39:59
is an open stairway from heaven he
40:01
created an open heaven in the prison
40:05
it's powerful to see the things that
40:07
remain that we're done by those in the
40:10
past that love God obey God and we're
40:14
going to make a lot of those places
40:15
right now in this earth amen so this is
40:20
this is the time to walk in liberty
40:21
freedom
40:22
right and justice and I recently in Reno
40:27
we all know that Kavanaugh
40:29
I'm very political right now I'm doing
40:32
heavens politics executing God God's
40:36
government on the earth so if we have a
40:39
government on the earth from heaven that
40:41
we have to execute for him that's
40:42
politics so you're not going to escape
40:46
politics don't ignore it make sure you
40:49
vote for justice and righteousness right
40:51
and life and
40:54
God needs this nation free of the devil
41:02
which means it's gonna be good for
41:05
everybody here God is not gonna be a
41:09
parser to who's living here they will
41:11
enjoy all the Freedom and the Liberty to
41:14
prosper you know to live in health to
41:17
have new creations and inventions never
41:19
seen before in this country they'll
41:22
enjoy all the stuff that will be created
41:24
in these 24 years of God in the White
41:26
House you've never heard that that is
41:32
not news to me
41:33
and God has hand-picked the person he
41:38
wants there and there's no human being
41:42
on this earth there's nothing in the
41:45
Earth's over there's nothing that can
41:48
take those people from that white house
41:49
[Applause]
42:00
amen
42:02
hey man I hope everybody's happy about
42:08
that
42:09
that God would pick remember he's
42:13
strange he doesn't think like a man he
42:18
picked the most on likely never in the
42:23
history of our country has one man
42:25
caused such an uproar never in the
42:29
history of our nation or even in this
42:32
world except Christ because Christ
42:35
caused the greatest
42:36
uproar and his time he was not liked by
42:41
the hierarchy he was hated by the ruling
42:44
powers and the devil especially despised
42:47
him and tried every way he could to get
42:51
him out of the picture just have
42:54
something here
42:56
you never hear any of this coming
42:59
against someone who isn't gonna do good
43:01
did you notice that the ones you don't
43:05
care about the country don't even know
43:07
what they're doing that might not have
43:09
been their plan but they just weren't
43:10
the right person amen and that means in
43:14
any country it says when when the
43:18
righteous are in leadership when they're
43:20
in charge the people will they will
43:26
rejoice and God does love everybody but
43:29
just like he chose John the Baptist for
43:32
something Moses or something Abraham for
43:35
something Jacob Isaac it didn't go all
43:38
the way down the line David Solomon he
43:41
hand-picked them before they were here
43:44
he still does that
43:46
and it's usually if you look at King
43:49
David he smelled like the Sheep he
43:53
danced and sang in the meadows you would
43:56
not have picked him to be king
43:59
even the Prophet was amazed the ones who
44:03
look tough strong handsome those were
44:07
the ones he wanted to and God said no no
44:11
no no yeah and what about Gideon he here
44:19
all the time from God he actually told
44:22
God no no no no no I must have the wrong
44:24
person nope I'm not doing this no no
44:27
that is not me I am NOT doing it but God
44:32
kicked him did he do it you have to be
44:38
the same way because you know what I
44:41
wouldn't pick me and apparently neither
44:45
would a lot of pastors
44:52
they don't know what they're missing for
44:57
one reason they don't like the pink here
45:00
this is the absolute truth yeah God
45:04
would not do that that's our answer when
45:07
you know I love you but you don't know
45:08
him you might put color on your hair in
45:13
the middle of the night as you're
45:17
walking across a platform to speak turn
45:19
it green then they run wait for it
45:29
[Applause]
45:30
one change something so insignificant
45:37
because image is important your image
45:42
inside is always more important than
45:44
that outside and the thing is I've known
45:47
a lot of these pastors for 40 years
45:50
helped in all their projects my dad that
45:53
we would my family go help in all their
45:55
projects to help the poor the sick paint
45:57
their churches up to bring them food and
45:59
they were blessed beyond measure about
46:01
how godly and awesome we were until I
46:04
fell off the deep man and put pink in my
46:05
hair you choose they choose a man I will
46:16
tell you this their wives coming to my
46:18
meetings
46:23
and the other thing they say is well I
46:25
love what you do but our congregation is
46:27
not ready and when will I see them at
46:29
the meetings they show up I've got a
46:34
pastor something those church I'm so
46:36
glad and love with Revelation so you
46:43
have to choose through your whole life
46:44
you have to choose things and I am glad
46:47
he chose me and I actually like the pink
46:51
hair now it's not going away because in
46:57
this time we're gonna be strange just
46:59
like him we will be different speak
47:02
different live differently and it will
47:05
cause people to come and ask you why
47:07
amen I need a tissue
47:10
oh yeah if I if I if I cry during the
47:15
worship it's gonna be over any man yeah
47:22
Jesus makes me cry a lot the love he has
47:26
for us and he he looks beyond our
47:31
mistakes and the thing is people wanted
47:36
to throw mistakes in with sin and
47:37
they'll tell you have to repent you may
47:39
have made a mistake but you apologize
47:41
for mistakes you don't repent for
47:43
mistakes you repent for sin I'm having
47:46
to teach that to some people there's a
47:48
difference Amen I mean you know I've had
47:52
people say all kinds of things like well
47:54
you lied because you said you would come
47:56
by and you didn't
47:57
I said that's I forgot that's not lying
48:01
lying is saying something that's not the
48:04
true and so they're gonna get a lesson
48:07
if they say things like that to me and
48:09
what no I love you very much but you
48:12
know when you've got 15 phone calls and
48:14
people showing up you gotta make
48:15
decisions for things around the world
48:16
you probably forget some time I said but
48:20
that's not lying okay so I apologized so
48:25
don't let people make you feel like you
48:27
have sinned because you made a mistake
48:29
amen
48:31
okay making mistakes in this world is
48:34
gonna happen sometime right if I got to
48:37
send a letter to somebody you know the
48:40
simplest things but most people who bash
48:42
you by the way they don't have a vision
48:45
of their own the father showed me this a
48:48
long time a lot of the bastards out
48:49
there that bash you online or whatever
48:51
they don't have their own vision so
48:54
people who do they will bash you this is
48:58
truth that's why they can get so mean
49:01
they have nothing in their own life just
49:03
keeping them focused and their going
49:05
forward something they have nothing to
49:07
do and they don't want to do anything
49:08
they look around to see who they can
49:10
pick on let them go just let it go and
49:14
you keep running your race amen because
49:19
you know the enemy will try anything you
49:20
can to get you sad offended wounded
49:26
fearful that will crush you keep you
49:29
back take you off the track and so if
49:32
you can't get you to abandon Christ or
49:34
just say I'm giving up completely he'll
49:37
do whatever he can to delay you or
49:38
distract you so don't let it happen just
49:41
say well I'm not gonna let that it's not
49:43
touching me I'm not letting it penetrate
49:46
me you notice Christ walks like that in
49:47
this earth
49:48
amen so in this time we will do things
49:52
to manifest them and demonstrate for
49:55
them and it won't necessarily be in a
49:57
small crowd so get ready to go to
50:01
Walmart and you're walking in the air
50:03
while you're pushing your cart down here
50:04
down the aisle you know how if you're
50:07
walking your the carts down here see how
50:12
many people come to you say what is up
50:14
with you I am manifesting the Living God
50:20
that sound exciting he's given us a
50:26
whole new way and new weapons and
50:31
demonstrating and manifesting is one of
50:33
those weapons because you are terrifying
50:35
the enemy every time you do something
50:37
like that he'll is afraid right now and
50:42
they and you know what they're not
50:44
really good at hiding that whatever
50:48
rises up and they're afraid but they
50:49
will bash it bash it lies you know and
50:53
misjudgment and everything fails they'll
50:54
do it on purpose to make people think
50:57
that person is nothing
50:59
they're not worth something they have no
51:00
value whatsoever or they're not living
51:02
the right kind of line and they're not
51:04
going to jack the wicked any men but
51:08
hell hell is going to find out that
51:11
heaven is going to expose a lot of that
51:14
amen so we'll know who carries truth who
51:17
lives the truth so we can trust them
51:21
amen
51:22
is a powerful time time for freedom
51:26
everybody say time for freedom that
51:33
means your lies you'd be different your
51:34
children will be raised differently in
51:36
this time we have the right and the
51:39
freedom to command heavens army to push
51:43
back the darkness and crush their plans
51:45
right to raise the dead that we're
51:48
cremated stop earthquakes and make it go
51:53
back the way it was before it happened
51:54
oh stop the storms and not just the
52:02
Hurricanes and you know that has been so
52:05
powerful to work with people over the
52:06
last several months God started the
52:09
weather warriors I didn't and he put one
52:13
more thing on my plate get down there
52:17
and tell people how to take authority
52:18
over those storms
52:20
in this time in the earth you're not
52:22
supposed to have destructive weather say
52:26
I receive it Jesus didn't tolerate the
52:31
storm and that was not the only one he
52:36
stopped it wasn't the only one he
52:40
stopped you do realize the Bible is sort
52:43
of like a basic outline because the
52:48
Bible says itself if everything in all
52:50
the works that Christ did were written
52:52
down the books would go around the world
52:55
so how much do you not know about
52:59
he didn't just raise the people from the
53:02
dead you read about in that Bible it was
53:05
an example okay well while we raised
53:08
someone from the dead they were dead for
53:10
four days Wow way to spend thirty days
53:14
and you're your family members ashes
53:18
have been sitting on the Shelf in the
53:19
closet the mantle and you go oh well we
53:22
forgot to have their celebration service
53:24
so you're bringing a little ashes and
53:27
set it there you better be ready for
53:29
this one and Jesus says to you and you
53:34
hear him get everything laying hands on
53:36
that John come in the ashes come in
53:39
their life in their spirit to come back
53:41
into that body and it burst open and
53:46
there is a whirlwind of ashes right here
53:49
in wherever they're having the
53:50
acceleration there's gonna be a
53:53
celebration and those ashes go out
53:55
places they stopped and there's the
53:57
person I tell you they'll be miraculous
54:01
miraculous conversions
54:04
and salvations in the celebration when
54:10
they go in Jesus name I command that
54:12
spirit of the whatever tobe white to
54:15
come back into his body and that earned
54:17
burst and that whirlwind of ashes come
54:20
up say he can put the ashes back
54:23
together even if they sprinkled him on
54:27
the ocean he knows where every molecule
54:32
of our body is and he can bring it all
54:38
back together say that is a greater work
54:46
I've seen many of the greater works and
54:50
their greater or he would not have said
54:53
they were greater right so you know it
54:57
be praised against uh they pray against
54:59
the storms and everything and your
55:00
prayers probably made a difference but
55:03
when you command Christ commanded the
55:08
storm to stop he stopped the winds and
55:14
he calmed the waves amen
55:18
so we do greater works so we stop
55:21
earthquakes who make it put it back say
55:26
Amen well you believe it or not it's
55:30
gonna happen this is the thing if he
55:33
ever wants you to do something like that
55:35
you will hear him you're not going to
55:39
sit down and make a list I'm gonna go do
55:40
this on this day those type of things he
55:42
will say it to you and you will hear him
55:45
and he showed me that happening in the
55:47
earth
55:47
I was taken forward and I saw what
55:50
happening I saw a young person in
55:52
California they've been a massive
55:54
earthquake buildings crumbled everywhere
55:56
hundreds of people died in this
55:59
earthquake and they ran out in the
56:01
street and they said stop and then they
56:07
said put it back in Jesus name
56:13
and the earth began to shift and all the
56:17
parts of the buildings came up out of
56:18
the ground and put the building back
56:20
together the bridges came back together
56:23
and all the dead were raised and back in
56:25
the offices or the stores are walking on
56:27
the street where they were before it
56:29
happened
56:32
say greater work we will do them in that
56:39
powerful Jesus said all the works I did
56:44
you will do and even greater works you
56:47
will do we didn't know what the greater
56:50
works were is those things a plane
56:55
crashes everybody dies the news media
56:58
run to record it and show it and the
57:01
person with the microphones are believer
57:03
and Jesus says to them bring them all
57:06
back to a life and they command over
57:09
that whole thing you will go back the
57:12
way you were I command every spirit of
57:14
every person somebody come back into
57:15
their body and life will be restored now
57:17
I know I've told you before all the
57:20
people came back from the dead that were
57:22
burnt but the plane also came back
57:24
together like it never happened and
57:28
because she was the reporter they all
57:32
saw it all over the world because he's
57:37
not doing things in secret they will be
57:41
done openly manifests the way word
57:44
manifest means to clearly and plainly
57:46
make known you're living in those days
57:52
and I'm just giving you a warning a
57:54
heads-up then it will happen to you
57:58
sometime in your life
58:00
it's gonna happen and the mass dead
58:04
raising the raising of the masses of
58:06
dead it's going to happen in our
58:09
lifetime it's going to happen
58:13
that means if somebody went somewhere
58:15
some evil harming and the use chemical
58:18
warfare and the whole entire place was
58:20
dead you will go in there and speak
58:25
God's Word whatever God says for you to
58:27
say you speak and everyone who is dead
58:29
would be alive whole and well and all
58:32
the any remnants of that chemicals on
58:35
the entire city the ground the air the
58:37
water will be gone in Jesus name people
58:42
are gonna know and this is his real
58:46
reason for doing that they will know
58:48
there is a God and we only do this
58:53
because of him we can't do this without
58:57
him but we will do it for him and with
59:01
him and God's plan is to erase the whole
59:06
gray area that says there is no God so I
59:13
know I've seen millions of Muslims
59:16
running to the kingdom I've been shown
59:19
millions of homosexuals run into the
59:22
kingdom and as they ran into the kingdom
59:26
they got all their body parts back like
59:29
God made them God does care about them
59:35
and I can tell you this
59:36
I'm messing around this some of those
59:38
people has some of the greatest callings
59:41
on their life
59:43
or the devil would not have messed him
59:46
up and they think you were born that way
59:48
but God doesn't make anybody that way
59:50
because that is not his image and we are
59:53
made in His image there'll be some of
59:58
the greatest witnesses amen
60:03
Jesus even appearing before the scene he
60:06
not the Sanhedrin you know he just said
60:10
to me I already did that he does have a
60:17
sense of humor and he's like but here
60:19
beside me walking with ya I know he's in
60:21
me but he's also walking with me he'll
60:24
tell me things to say thing to talk
60:25
about because he loves this time amen
60:30
he's been appearing in person to the
60:33
Taliban even to some of the ISIS like
60:39
face to face with them someone I know
60:44
was going around preaching these they
60:47
preach a lot in the Middle East and they
60:49
went into this country where they're the
60:51
the Taliban were actually in this
60:53
country he's fearless this person is
60:54
fearless he's done all kinds of certain
60:56
signs and wonders for God in those
60:58
countries and then he went in that
61:00
country and separately I thought if he
61:04
was going on the sides to be one of us
61:05
all these Muslims came out to him and
61:09
the one in the front had a Bible under
61:11
holding a Bible on their head they were
61:14
walking to him not with guns now in
61:18
machine guns not wanting to blow him up
61:20
which was what most of them I do their
61:22
walk around with a Bible on his head and
61:25
they went up and said the 1-cos speaking
61:27
that's it did you bring Bibles with you
61:29
you have any Bibles because I've been
61:33
reading this one to them and they want
61:35
to know that God they want to know Jesus
61:38
Christ do you have any Bibles you have
61:40
Bibles that we can have because of one
61:46
of them having the Word of God they
61:48
didn't burn it they didn't throw it away
61:49
God moved on them to read it and they
61:53
begin to see a different kind of God
61:56
then who they worshiped and that whole
61:59
group got saved that was that was a
62:02
suddenly the other thing that is for
62:05
this time are suddenly say suddenly say
62:09
something will happen overnight
62:13
and it will change me forever it's
62:17
called a suddenly
62:20
[Music]
62:21
it's called a suddenly because we're in
62:26
an accelerated time even in our own
62:29
country here in America so many things
62:32
have already been shifted and begin to
62:34
change in a short amount of time over
62:39
the years we've fought there's been so
62:40
many jobs lost in this country it wasn't
62:44
just because of one one leader it's just
62:47
happened the economy has really gone
62:49
down and this time it will prosper and
62:51
flourish like it never has before
62:53
because of God's plan of our obedience
62:56
and because Jesus is here taking over ok
63:00
that there will be one suddenly after
63:03
another in our economy and and since we
63:06
now have a righteous man in the Supreme
63:09
Court and I started talking about
63:11
Kavanagh and stopped but we will have
63:13
one suddenly after another in this
63:15
country because this is God's plan and
63:19
we're ready for it amen but but in a
63:24
little bit over just a year or so two
63:28
million jobs have been created in this
63:31
country and in my own City I see signs
63:34
everywhere we are hiring hiring hiring
63:37
hiring we have so much hiring going on
63:40
in our city and when I visit places I
63:42
see those same signs they're hiring
63:45
because they have money and their
63:49
business is increasing that means they
63:51
need more people this is a good time to
63:54
get into business amen and I like to
63:58
tell people what Jesus says to me he
64:00
said I was sawn I was sent into the
64:03
business arena I was first known in the
64:06
business arena a carpenter he said my
64:10
father did not send me as pastor Jesus
64:13
he didn't he sent him as a business man
64:19
who could connect with every area and
64:22
everywhere whatever the arenas were he
64:25
could connect with him because he was a
64:26
businessman
64:28
why was the eating with the sinners
64:31
people wanna know how come he was sit
64:32
with sinners because he had business
64:35
contracts with them
64:38
he was a master carpenter he had the
64:41
best home they knew he did really good
64:44
stuff so he had all kinds of business
64:46
contracts all the time
64:47
Heymann had him with the sinners and
64:49
they liked him business is a good Avenue
64:54
to take the gospel that's why he's
64:58
sending me as a business woman I know I
65:04
have revelation I know talk about the
65:07
wild things of God he gave me that
65:08
revelation he gave it to me
65:12
I never said John said okay I want this
65:14
this and this I only asked him for love
65:17
I wanted to love him I asked him for
65:21
more love I'm gonna be like my earthly
65:24
father was who was filled with so much
65:26
of the love of God
65:27
he literally loved his enemies and had
65:30
fun doing it i understanding i
65:33
understand the blessing that curse it's
65:35
a whole lot more fun to bless people who
65:36
don't like you it gives the devil a
65:40
really bad day and it goes into the soul
65:43
of that person and it makes you happy
65:46
cuz it's better to give dad my dad lived
65:51
by that so I give away stuff all the
65:53
time
65:53
I had them come home from work there'd
65:55
be stuff missing
65:58
he knew I gave it away my dad did that
66:02
we get I give away food people give me
66:04
suffer give it away I get money I give
66:06
it away that's why I have a CFO that
66:08
takes care of the money I won't be able
66:11
to go anywhere I'm gonna make any
66:13
products when I first got products at
66:15
game all away I gave all my books away
66:18
I'm gonna bless you here's okay 500
66:21
books away marbles where's the books I
66:24
bless the people she says those were
66:26
supposed to be sold so we could get more
66:29
and then you can take some of them and
66:30
give them away blessed people so from
66:33
now on those products aren't coming to
66:34
you they're being shipped to me every
66:39
what happen on the products table
66:42
because my dad has such a heart to love
66:45
and care he didn't care what color you
66:48
were he didn't care what he didn't even
66:49
care what your faith was he was gonna
66:50
love you bless you and feed you he was a
66:55
good example for me that's why you got
66:58
to have people that can do the other
66:59
stuff even in business you can have a
67:02
visionary the visionary he's so excited
67:05
and passionate about everything if you
67:07
don't have something there to help you
67:08
with your money you're gonna have none
67:10
unless you have both of those gifts you
67:14
need someone who could be administrator
67:17
if you're thinking about going to
67:18
business make sure you have that other
67:20
half that you don't have you can have a
67:23
vision the parks look amazing but if you
67:25
don't have someone to make sure things
67:27
are done right or kept like all the
67:29
licenses and permits are renewed the
67:31
insurance is being paid you know the
67:33
taxes are being paid you better have
67:35
something that can do that keep track of
67:37
stuff for you okay and keep it multi
67:40
trillionaire didn't give whole
67:42
warehouses away if you want to this is
67:49
also a time for money to be manifested
67:52
in great amounts to us the wealth of the
67:56
wicked
67:58
and then I receive it - I'm gonna
68:02
receive that and people gonna want oh we
68:06
know we're getting out of here why did
68:08
you why'd you tell those people those
68:09
things we want to leave I want that's
68:11
not contain ship time you don't know
68:13
what time he's coming back that's what
68:16
we have some pins back there magnets as
68:18
they roll up your rapture rug that's
68:23
Holy Spirit yells that everywhere he
68:25
goes
68:25
roll up your rapture rug that's not what
68:31
he meant by occupy but that's what I was
68:37
taught my whole life in church Jesus
68:42
could come next week you might come
68:44
tomorrow oh and I don't think you know
68:47
that I think we should be encouraged to
68:50
be here stay here do something make a
68:55
difference and don't buy the c-rations
68:59
it tastes awful I don't even think the
69:03
raccoons would eat them people would
69:07
send us stuff in the mail when I don't
69:08
think I want this we throw it on the
69:11
back patio we have a raccoon you know
69:14
assembly that comes every now and then
69:15
they picked it up and threw it back down
69:18
and what we are not eating those okay if
69:22
the raccoons with Needleman a garbage
69:26
they are a bitter one I don't want it
69:29
amen
69:31
they like doughnuts
69:37
those raccoons were getting like that
69:39
fat we finally finally have stopped
69:43
feeding Emily because when we leave
69:46
there
69:46
no one's gonna feed them okay they're
69:48
not it doesn't say that the Lord will
69:50
set a table for them you could set a
69:53
table for us so yeah people come to my
70:01
house and the raccoons are staring this
70:03
like last door and they'll go down knock
70:07
on the doors if you throw something out
70:15
there like a sub sandwich they'll scrape
70:17
all the lettuce and tomatoes out not
70:21
eating that stuff peep out that you're
70:27
hurting the know we've never had a
70:29
single one die that have been
70:33
flourishing bountifully prospering in
70:36
every way the only issue is we've got
70:41
something to keep him away from coming
70:43
over the preserve work next to preserve
70:44
and the cats we feed out front
70:47
guess he's meeting the cats yeah they
70:51
know they're smart they came around the
70:53
front to get the cats food we have to
70:57
got them running away away of course
70:59
they know us so they're like wow you've
71:03
just moved dinner to the front you go
71:06
everything moves Pico there make sure
71:08
the raccoons yeah but there go go away
71:10
go away they like us
71:17
that's why I my I actually just redid my
71:21
whole bio to send out to the pastures
71:24
now who invite me and I've added to a
71:28
tormentor of demons apply for a job
71:34
somewhere to put it on there and see
71:36
what people say to you it is a great
71:41
thing I've had 25 years business
71:46
experience you know and all these people
71:48
and companies I've worked for and
71:49
everything and then I say you know and
71:51
you go on down the little list there you
71:53
know I've done this done that achieve
71:55
that wow that whatever and then I go I'm
71:58
a tormentor of demons I speak to the
72:03
weather you know and the storm stops and
72:07
I live with my husband so many years of
72:09
success with the resident raccoons is a
72:12
crazy squirrel and some rescue cats
72:16
that's either going to impress them with
72:18
nothing to do you I don't I don't have
72:21
to give up resumes now but that would
72:23
have been really nice to give that out
72:25
right be different this is the time for
72:33
great extreme extravagant favor for the
72:37
body of Christ like we have never had it
72:40
before and God told me in America there
72:45
will be a time when people will be proud
72:47
that they have you know Christians for
72:50
their friends the singers will be proud
72:52
to announce oh why not have a couple
72:54
Christians that are my friends they go
72:57
you have Christians what do they talk
72:59
about do they raise the dead you seen
73:02
them raise the dad do they have fire
73:06
coming out of their head
73:08
because we saw some of that on the
73:10
internet we want to know do you know any
73:13
other Christians that might want friends
73:15
cuz they're not doing that right now but
73:21
they will it's a time for freedom and
73:25
I'm also fill this in for free but there
73:29
will come a time that even the wild
73:32
animals will be at peace with us in this
73:35
earth they won't attack they will have
73:39
no fear of us because we'll have so much
73:41
of God's presence and our life they will
73:45
trust us and I'm talking about four
73:48
generations that will happen and then
73:52
when the last last days come there's a
73:54
scripture in the Bible that kind of
73:56
talks about that but it talks about the
73:59
beasts of the field will come and attack
74:00
the people and the people will be
74:02
shocked because it hasn't happened for
74:06
generations because of heaven being in
74:09
this earth and we allow it to be in our
74:11
lives we operate and and you know in the
74:14
supernatural with Jesus Christ he lives
74:17
in you he's gonna operate through you
74:20
then things are going to be drastically
74:23
different in this earth if you apply for
74:27
a job in the government you'll probably
74:28
be hired immediately because you have
74:31
Christian on your application this
74:35
government will be so radically changed
74:39
and justice will be given like it's
74:42
supposed to be given and now I'm gonna
74:46
go back to Cavanaugh for a few minutes
74:48
when I was watching that where they
74:51
actually gave the vote remember he won
74:54
by two votes that was probably by two
74:57
Democrats that changed their mind some
75:00
some of them did actually vote for him
75:02
when they were confronted I think it was
75:06
that one senator the stood up and said
75:07
that he was ashamed of all of them he
75:10
said they're lying and you know you are
75:12
lying but trying to prove Cavanaugh to
75:16
be a victor victor to be a perpetrator
75:21
he said when you say that he is wrong
75:23
he's committed a crime you're lying and
75:26
you know that person was paid and she
75:30
was paid Cavanaugh has been innocent his
75:34
whole life a strong believer a loving
75:38
family man even in high school in
75:40
college so many people who knew him came
75:42
up they didn't put him on the way to see
75:44
him but they told the news reporters in
75:46
anyway you never probably saw that in
75:48
the news they had so many more people
75:51
standing with him than against him but
75:54
they were desperate because nothing else
75:57
was working so they chose lying and
76:00
deceiving which is wrong and I'm talking
76:05
about this is about our justice system
76:07
this is about telling the truth this
76:10
whole thing was about telling the truth
76:11
is that right it wasn't just a position
76:15
it was about the Supreme Court or
76:19
they're supposed to you know make sure
76:22
truth is being done and justice is being
76:25
given while they weren't given him
76:26
justice and the father was telling me in
76:29
heaven he will win that seat and I will
76:32
make sure he wins that seat I don't care
76:35
what they try what they say he is
76:37
absolutely innocent and he himself will
76:39
have justice in that moment and he said
76:42
and when he wins the seat he is one to
76:46
see for heaven on the Supreme Court
76:51
because he's a believer and he said yes
76:54
to God we said yes to God you give him
76:57
permission to operate in you in your
76:59
household in your business and so when I
77:02
was watching all this going on God said
77:04
when they said you know he had one God
77:06
said this moment I am sending three
77:09
special ops angels to be with him the
77:14
whole time he's on the earth the whole
77:16
time he's in the Supreme Court which
77:18
will be a long long time
77:20
he said these angels will keep him from
77:22
all harm and no one who comes against
77:25
him will succeed and he said these
77:27
angels are some of them wants the hosts
77:30
the army who fought for Israel in the
77:33
flesh that's why they're special ops
77:39
special operatives
77:41
that's how importance is to God he said
77:45
when he won he won me a seat God said he
77:50
won me a seat in Supreme Court
77:52
[Applause]
77:58
he is serious about justice and at the
78:04
moment that they said that he had one
78:06
you know it was fifty two forty eight
78:08
and it's them they said he had one I
78:11
heard millions of little babies in
78:15
heaven celebrating and I heard them
78:22
shouting now in America freedom will
78:26
come to all the little babies and what
78:29
was allowed for us to die will be struck
78:33
down and the future is gonna be great
78:39
for the little babies being born in
78:41
America amen if you think heaven wasn't
78:45
involved in that they were very involved
78:47
even the ones living there were involved
78:50
but especially the little babies and
78:53
ones that were aborted that live in
78:55
heaven they were shouting and
78:56
celebrating they knew what was going on
78:58
in the earth they knew how important
79:00
that he won that seat because they will
79:02
overturn Roe vs. Wade
79:03
[Applause]
79:16
thank you Jesus
79:27
amen
79:31
heaven is very excited about this time
79:34
if you have family members living there
79:37
they are all cheering right now because
79:41
heaven is shifting our government so
79:45
they can then shape the future of this
79:48
nation and people will come to this
79:53
country to find God amen so this is
80:00
definitely a time for freedom and
80:05
everyone will benefit from it even the
80:09
ones who didn't want it and you can get
80:11
so far into deception you don't
80:13
realizing you don't realize because of
80:16
the heat of the moment and being used by
80:19
the enemy you cannot even you can't even
80:23
I'm trying to think
80:24
I don't not very good with with human
80:27
words yeah you can't comprehend what
80:29
you're saying yes to how that would
80:31
affect your future and they're not
80:33
realizing that they were damaging the
80:35
future of their generations coming on
80:37
the earth and then I will just talk
80:39
about the agenda because I will and God
80:42
wants me to the agenda of this
80:45
Democratic Party now not even before but
80:49
now has has really regressed into
80:53
darkness so much because they filled
80:57
their self with hate and judgment and
81:00
lies that were given and even the fake
81:03
news are getting physical I mean mental
81:05
therapy mental help because they've
81:08
messed up their own soul as you think it
81:11
in your soul or your heart that is what
81:14
you will become so what they spew down
81:17
all the time that's why they can't let
81:20
it go they have become the very thing
81:24
that they gave out to everybody they ate
81:27
it themselves every time they said it
81:29
and winning their soul and they don't
81:32
know how to be healed they don't know
81:34
how to be made whole
81:35
families were separated I know people
81:38
there family members will not talk to
81:41
them if they voted for Trump they've
81:43
written him off their list like they
81:44
never existed because their souls were
81:49
filled with darkness
81:50
I know Trump wasn't perfect God knows he
81:54
wasn't perfect but if we dug far enough
81:57
back and almost everybody's past we
82:00
should took every every part of the
82:01
media let's go back in their past 30
82:03
years and see what they were doing how
82:07
about all those senators how about all
82:09
those Democrats that were voting against
82:10
Cavanaugh why don't we go back in their
82:13
life and see what they did way back when
82:16
but when we give our lives to God and
82:25
whether you know it or not
82:27
Trump has given his heart to Jesus
82:30
Christ he's given his heart to Jesus
82:34
Christ I know a lot of leaders who he
82:35
calls in all the time Deacon consol he
82:37
stands in the counsel of the godly which
82:41
is another reason why the Liberals don't
82:44
like him because they don't want
82:47
godliness they don't want righteousness
82:49
they thought it was bad enough that
82:51
Trump won and they didn't like him but
82:54
they realized he was giving God a place
82:56
in the White House and welcoming God in
82:59
our country they really got terrified
83:01
thinking it's all over if he stays in
83:04
there we'll lose everything we've gained
83:06
over the last twenty thirty years we'll
83:08
lose it all
83:10
we need to do something to stop this but
83:15
they can't they can't and every time
83:19
they try to do something they desist on
83:22
heaven they will lose they'll lose in
83:28
the elections they'll lose in areas of
83:31
business they lose in areas of the
83:33
government because this is God's divine
83:36
time and when you said right before the
83:38
election I'm turning that map red
83:41
whether anyone likes it or not I'm
83:44
putting my hand on America I'm gonna
83:47
move across it when they wake up in the
83:49
morning they will find out that map is
83:51
red was it red well get ready for the
83:56
midterm elections
83:58
[Applause]
84:09
it's gonna turn it red again because
84:15
this is his plan and it goes from the
84:17
top down and our president is saying yes
84:21
to freedom yes to liberty yester
84:25
prospering yester protecting our country
84:27
yes to a sound military yes to the
84:30
rights of the believers being restored
84:32
right over to in the Johnson amendment
84:34
they said they couldn't speak from their
84:36
pulpit about about the but you know
84:40
about voting his stuff they couldn't
84:41
have a political platform at all which
84:44
wasn't fair because every other group
84:48
could do it it didn't matter what they
84:51
were they could be Satanists and they
84:54
still let them have a political platform
84:56
it didn't matter what kind of platform
84:58
that but then but not Christians because
85:01
we are a threat to the darkness amen so
85:08
God is moving powerfully on our country
85:13
so when Cavanaugh won that was a great
85:17
victory for justice for generations so
85:25
you should be really excited and
85:27
celebrate every day of your life that
85:29
God chose this time and he said I'm
85:32
starting with America because I know
85:35
who's going to win I know what their
85:37
whole plan is I know the body of Christ
85:39
had been praying and praying for years
85:44
that he would come and heal our land and
85:48
all those prayers were collected in
85:51
bowls and they were chipped amen they
85:56
were chipped so everyone who prayed that
86:01
prayer Chronicles for generations in the
86:04
past are a part of our victory today
86:07
amen because he is healing our land
86:12
and things are going to get better not
86:17
worse amen
86:19
so vote Republican I November to make
86:25
sure you go vote
86:28
there'll be angels in every voting booth
86:31
[Music]
86:35
people like you just wild yes I am I'm
86:39
acting just like heaven because guess
86:42
what they have seen the future they know
86:47
the future when your loved one goes home
86:50
God shows them the future they know what
86:54
you're gonna be doing you're you're just
86:57
you know you the generations after you
86:58
won't be doing he knows it all he's been
87:01
from the end at the beginning the
87:02
beginning to the end and he knows all of
87:05
it and he knows who he chooses is going
87:09
to be what he wants him to be amen so I
87:13
don't even know what time it is what
87:14
time is it okay see I don't that's too
87:18
small so that's what he wanted to talk
87:24
about tonight
87:24
he had me wear my patriotic
87:30
and before when you allow the burning of
87:36
our flag that flag will fly high
87:39
everywhere and that image is being put
87:42
on every kind of product possible you'll
87:46
see a lot more red white and blue I saw
87:48
hope businesses painting their
87:49
businesses red white and blue I did
87:53
everywhere I went and you know I've been
87:55
placed aboard the red white and blue
87:56
buildings clothing with it on it even
87:59
some cars were painted red white and
88:01
blue and I promise you you watch and see
88:03
how many me how many automobile I didn't
88:07
know what to call them
88:08
the manufacturers Saint you Holy Spirit
88:10
begin to send those cars and trucks out
88:13
painted red white and blue it's going to
88:18
happen more and more and more and our
88:20
flag will be honored because it
88:22
represents Christ event it represents
88:27
Christ and America belongs to God
88:30
America is a Christian nation
88:33
[Applause]
88:40
so I'm always happy to talk about
88:43
America that is beautiful because God is
88:47
here amen and along with that and the
88:51
body of Christ beginning to manifest in
88:55
amazing stunning shocking miraculous
89:00
things that that is one of the reasons
89:03
why God waited for the internet to do
89:05
this because no one can stop those signs
89:10
and wonders being seen all over the
89:14
world
89:14
amen I think a lot of people in this
89:19
country are very tired of doom and gloom
89:21
predictions this is not the time for God
89:25
to use whether as judgment it's not this
89:30
is the day of his power not the day of
89:32
his wrath those things are recorded in
89:35
the very end of the Bible
89:37
don't jump ahead okay make sure we all
89:40
walk out our lives and God's timeline
89:43
this is the time for us to stop those
89:46
things and it'd be strange that
89:49
something is allowed to bring
89:50
destruction through the weather because
89:53
we won't tolerate it so how many people
89:56
here have already be become weather
89:58
warriors can I see our hands in here
90:01
yeah where's the weather warrior you're
90:04
taking authority over the storm every
90:09
time and let me tell you the the
90:11
meteorologists don't know what's wrong
90:13
with their minds just like the fake news
90:16
don't know what's going on the
90:18
meteorologists don't know what's going
90:19
on actually we actually typed out one of
90:23
the reports after lane that was the
90:25
hurricane that was opposed to hit Hawaii
90:27
I think was a category 4 and it wasn't
90:30
very far if this is going to hit hit the
90:32
coast it's gonna do wipe out buildings
90:35
and many people will be killed and the
90:38
storm surge will go over the whole I
90:39
mean they were making the most
90:40
destructive you ever noticed how they're
90:44
getting more destructive with her with
90:46
her forecast
90:47
like I understand if a storm comes but
90:50
it's not wiping everybody out in the
90:51
state okay it's not they're getting and
90:54
the thing is this if it doesn't happen
90:56
they have to fake it I don't know if any
90:59
of you've seen that I have friends in
91:02
Florida when one storm came through and
91:05
it went down the middle and did almost
91:07
no destruction it actually just did
91:08
bypass Tampa completely and they were
91:11
saying Tampa is gonna be head-on it's
91:12
gonna wipe everybody out there was
91:14
nothing and I think Roy fields if you
91:17
know him Roy feels powerful recording
91:20
artists he's been he was in the Lakeland
91:24
revival he sings a lot for a lot of
91:27
known his way he put it was remember the
91:30
what he put it who's who in the
91:32
Christian leaders ooh he said I have
91:36
sung for them I have sung for them and
91:39
he said but I've never heard this
91:41
revelation before in my life I had had a
91:44
chance to meet him and talk to him for
91:45
about an hour and then his life was
91:47
totally different he said we all need
91:50
this revelation to know who we are he
91:52
said I didn't even know who I was I
91:54
didn't know I didn't know I lived in God
91:56
before I was here I didn't know what
91:58
actually was his offspring and so his
92:02
whole life he had his head out of there
92:03
encounter since then he came as the
92:05
worship leader of the last cruise I was
92:07
on and and he had an amazing time so
92:12
revelation changes you but he himself
92:14
had reported it on Facebook that they
92:18
were trying to fake the storm doing
92:20
destruction in his own City which was
92:21
Kissimmee Florida and there wasn't any
92:24
and they had like wind machines out
92:26
there they have water like rising up
92:28
around this and he said I'm standing out
92:30
my street like there's not a drop of
92:33
rain on me so he actually turned him in
92:37
Peter Nevins said no there's none of
92:40
that's going on and then we did have a
92:43
report when it hit you know in Panama
92:45
City I think I said and I'm trying to
92:48
think I said neither said the airport or
92:50
something was flooded with all the rain
92:52
and that bill when they showed that was
92:54
not even from there you have to
92:57
understand they have got years of
92:59
destruction
93:00
of storms years of them and so they've
93:04
been using some of them I'm not saying
93:06
it wasn't actually saying there wasn't
93:07
nothing that happened but even in
93:09
Florence I do know there was there was
93:11
flooding and stuff like that but you
93:13
need to realize that if that category
93:15
that storm and hit head-on they would
93:17
have blown the buildings off the beach
93:19
there would be no buildings there'd be
93:22
nobody because it's like it was like a
93:24
bowl and when that went think a mature
93:27
it was a tropical storm it started as a
93:29
four till we started taking authority
93:31
over and you saw every single day the
93:34
news media would say it would get
93:35
stronger but it got downgraded and it
93:38
even showed this thing zigzag because
93:40
every time we would hit it it was exact
93:42
and they went this is the weirdest storm
93:45
in the history of meteorology we've
93:47
never we could never predict it because
93:50
we were telling it what it couldn't do
93:52
the believers the sinners can't do that
93:56
you don't have authority over the storms
93:58
but the cuts again on Facebook you're
94:01
gonna start a whole new move of God move
94:04
of God means it's not gonna stop I've
94:06
called the weather warriors and I will
94:09
start in that way with the Bight of
94:11
Christ who doesn't care whose
94:13
denomination they belong to because
94:16
those things affect everybody everywhere
94:19
they're gonna lay down all I've no one
94:21
ever said it was assembly god I'm
94:22
Baptists I'm not I mean nobody ever said
94:25
that to me on all the comments they
94:27
never said that I'm so glad that we're
94:29
taking authority over the storm of the
94:30
body of Christ that's coming together
94:32
we're doing this together and we are
94:33
defeating them it was powerful amen
94:40
so why don't we stand up and do
94:42
something if you've never done it before
94:44
we're going to take authority over the
94:45
storms that are out there right now and
94:49
the reason why they've been doing such
94:51
horrible destruction is because we have
94:53
let it happen Satan has run rampant
94:57
earth ruling and reigning and the only
95:00
ones who really could stop him was the
95:03
body of Christ filled with Jesus Christ
95:06
because we've been given power over all
95:08
the power of the enemy
95:11
Christ stop the storm amen and he said
95:16
the things I did you will do is that
95:18
true well we haven't been doing all the
95:20
things but we are now so we're going to
95:24
do this together say I choose as a child
95:27
of God
95:28
through the blood of Jesus Christ I take
95:33
power over all the power of the enemy
95:37
operating through any storm out there
95:40
whether it's a tropical storm a
95:43
hurricane no matter what it is we take
95:50
power over that we come in the middle of
95:54
ours to rise in that storm so the high
96:00
pressure will crush us storm it will be
96:05
downgraded until it becomes nothing we
96:10
command the hosts of heaven to go in the
96:13
storms begin to shred the bands all the
96:17
way around the storm
96:19
[Applause]
96:23
we receive justice through the weather
96:28
through Jesus Christ so be it
96:32
amen amen amen
96:43
sit down so we did it through the but
96:50
Jesus gave us power worth while the
96:52
enemy God did not on purpose create
96:55
destructive weather to kill steal and
96:56
destroy
96:57
guess who kills steals and destroys yeah
97:00
the devil does and now he's losing that
97:04
remember the keys in hell
97:07
that Christ took away from him death
97:11
hell and the grave were those storms
97:15
bring death and we were also given the
97:19
keys to the kingdom is that right so
97:22
Jesus has given us keys he's given his
97:24
power and authority he's given us
97:26
declarations he's given as an example
97:29
how he lived his life we are joint heirs
97:31
with him I was in law for eight years I
97:35
totally understand what being a joint
97:37
heir is you have the rights whatever he
97:41
had we have whatever you did we can do
97:44
that's what that means you're a joint
97:47
heir the last Testament is the last will
97:52
and testament of Jesus Christ just like
97:55
in law he gave us us rights in that well
97:59
amen and when he died and was risen
98:03
again he even gave us power over death
98:06
so you don't have to die from sickness
98:08
and disease
98:11
even as your soul prospers you will
98:14
prosper and be in health it is so
98:20
powerful to understand what the word
98:23
means and how to apply it to your life
98:27
that is getting training every
98:30
missionary should know about commanding
98:33
the host of heaven and sending them
98:35
against all the darkness in the
98:37
countries that their Minister being
98:39
missionaries in anyone who works against
98:43
human trafficking should know about
98:45
using the host that is heavens army that
98:49
was not created to defend heaven then
98:53
didn't get to fight when Lucifer fell
98:55
not one angel fought against any of
98:58
those one-third of the angels God kicked
99:01
him out on a lightning bolt
99:03
he made heaven it is his home he is in
99:07
charge of heaven so why did he make the
99:09
hosts why did he make them there's a
99:16
scroll in heaven that has been opened
99:18
recently that talks about the destiny of
99:21
the hosts that they cannot complete
99:23
their own destiny without us they cannot
99:28
on their own decide to go attack hell it
99:32
would have been wiped out already they
99:34
can't just get together and say ok let's
99:36
see today we're gonna go to this country
99:38
and wipe out all this we're gonna then
99:40
we're going to go this one we're gonna
99:41
do all this they have to have orders now
99:46
I know they have positions they have
99:48
inspectors they have people who command
99:50
certain parts of the army they have
99:52
positions like inspector to transport
99:55
they have a scout to go behind the enemy
99:57
lines and film all the activities of
99:59
hell it goes back to headquarters heaven
100:03
they have all of these positions that's
100:07
why we have those positions in our army
100:10
even in our own army those troops on her
100:13
own the privates can get together and
100:15
try to drive weapons off somewhere and
100:17
attack something they can't do that they
100:20
have to have orders as the military to
100:23
operate
100:24
and so does Heaven's military but we
100:28
were created to be commanders there's
100:32
many scriptures in the Bible that talked
100:33
about commanding even God said command
100:37
ye me didn't he he was not saying tell
100:41
me what to do he was saying you command
100:45
what will be done if you already know
100:50
God you know what his desire is for
100:52
something you already know it you're
100:55
living righteous correct then you can
100:58
call the army to come and fight on your
101:00
behalf and not just fight on your head
101:02
behalf but command it or God wouldn't
101:06
say command Jesus was also the Lord of
101:11
Hosts he was over the army what he did
101:14
we can do I'm not here to tell you all
101:16
the Scriptures I'm just telling you you
101:18
need to command the army of heaven but
101:22
the first thing you have to do is you
101:24
have to realize that you were given
101:25
power say the hosts of heaven we're not
101:30
given power over all the power of the
101:33
enemy say the angels are under us not
101:39
over us do you understand that
101:43
we came from inside God himself
101:47
we are his offspring he spoke and the
101:49
angels were made they were sent to
101:52
protect us and keep us in all of our
101:54
ways
101:56
now some people knew that and they
101:58
operated in that that's happened with
102:00
people before but in this time he wants
102:02
the body of Christ to realize stop
102:07
fighting his plans the enemy wants you
102:11
to fight God's plans because then you
102:14
won't become what he wants you to become
102:16
which is dangerous just a matter what
102:22
your age is your position is how much
102:24
money you have
102:26
it doesn't matter if you receive Jesus
102:28
Christ as your Savior then wash clean of
102:31
all your sins you're kind of righteous
102:33
you have entrance into heaven into all
102:35
of eternity why wouldn't you be able to
102:38
man say we're kings and priests unto our
102:45
God those are spiritual levels of
102:50
authority say every King commands an
102:58
army in the earth as the body of Christ
103:04
we are in the kingdom a spiritual
103:08
Kingdom we have spiritual weapons we get
103:12
to use them to pull down strongholds of
103:16
darkness
103:18
so wherever darkness is and evil is
103:22
operating we can do something about it
103:27
amen in this time off living yeah
103:34
the Holy Spirit would always yell at me
103:37
don't try it you do it don't just try it
103:44
if we're supposed to live in a way that
103:48
nothing by any means will harm us and
103:54
people can quote that scripture all day
103:55
long and yet harm comes to you doesn't
103:58
it we're attacked by the enemy aren't we
104:01
yeah well the army was designed and
104:04
created to stop those attacks to keep
104:09
you in all your ways amen because when
104:13
we are free of fear of being attacked we
104:17
can push back the enemy because he
104:21
certainly is not expecting it so he
104:24
doesn't like this meeting he doesn't
104:27
like these words he doesn't like me at
104:29
all that's okay I don't like him either
104:33
he's on the bottom of my list actually
104:35
he's under my feet
104:41
he is our doormat the Bible even says so
104:46
so we're not under but we are over
104:52
because we rule and reign with Christ
104:55
and the Bible says in this life not talk
105:00
them up you know later on we will - not
105:02
that they will not in the in the next
105:04
life not your life but in the next time
105:06
when there is no time when time is no
105:09
more that's the end not the end of
105:12
everything is the end of time when time
105:15
when you don't have to have calendars
105:17
and your body's not going to age and you
105:19
have to be concerned about am I gonna
105:21
have this to do that when that time of
105:24
timeless comes when we're timeless I'm
105:28
asking for that right now
105:30
but you asked what you believe in your
105:32
house do not doubt you should have
105:34
whatsoever you say I'm saying I'm
105:36
timeless he is reversing back to my
105:42
youth the people in heaven are timeless
105:46
no one is old if your grandmother or
105:50
great-grandmother moved to heaven at 99
105:52
she is not coming back when they step
106:00
out of this body they're 99 this step of
106:03
the wrinkled right wrinkled hard of
106:06
hearing their sight I say it's going
106:08
they probably don't feel very good they
106:10
can't run a job and they step out of
106:13
that body no because of 25 do you think
106:14
they're going back they aren't they'll
106:20
pray for you and declare over you and
106:23
make plans for you in heaven but they
106:24
are not coming back they won't be happy
106:30
and the day when we are timeless there
106:35
will be no war no evil no sickness no
106:39
disease no lack no threats no rejection
106:44
of any kind and we will live like that
106:50
through eternity but we can still create
106:53
we can invent we can speak to things and
106:57
they will appear you can ride on light
107:00
you can ride on music be transported to
107:04
light do time you have planets to visit
107:09
for vacation the new heaven will be your
107:15
home but you're going vacation to other
107:18
planets he says there will be a new
107:20
earth new heaven say it
107:24
and a new earth the earth will not just
107:28
be God's home in my father's house this
107:33
is Jesus speaking in his house that's
107:35
the world in this world this home that's
107:38
called heaven are many mansions that's
107:42
what's going on now but at the end of
107:44
time when he makes a new earth bigger
107:48
than our galaxy a massive earth that has
107:51
one landmass in an ocean I know there'll
107:54
be no more seas the sea separate the
107:56
land masses but as long as God exists
108:00
the river of life will never stop
108:01
flowing from him that's how the crystal
108:04
sea is made in heaven on the bottom is
108:07
not saying just gemstones they flow out
108:10
of the Father they're a part of him so
108:13
if you should one day wake up and you
108:16
have emeralds in your skin as a bracelet
108:21
that's the father's image not even New
108:28
Age can do that the devil tries to steal
108:37
as much as he can he lived there
108:40
remember
108:41
he knew how things worked in a lot of
108:43
things he says or his we're never is
108:48
your life and eternity will be the most
108:51
most splendors wondrous thing you've
108:55
ever experienced people move to have a
108:57
noun for R&R because they won't be there
109:03
one day they'll be moving to the
109:06
father's house right now they have a
109:08
place in the father's house is that what
109:10
the word says right now they go to
109:12
prepare a place for you and the world
109:14
called heaven which is the father's
109:16
house but on the new earth it will be
109:20
our house and he's going to pack his
109:24
bags and climb on the New Jerusalem and
109:27
we'll come down to the new earth and
109:29
he'll be with us forever so even he is
109:34
willing to move with this whole plan for
109:36
eternity
109:38
and we will be timeless we will have
109:42
glorified bodies we will be immortal all
109:47
of this is in the word mortality will
109:52
take on immortality when he said know ye
109:56
not that your gods that's the little G
109:58
that's what he was talking about one day
110:01
we'll be immortal like them we'll never
110:02
die never sin will never lack we'll be
110:07
timeless there'll be no time in heaven
110:10
there's no time in the new earth and
110:12
he'll create all these new things for us
110:14
to go and put things on it for us to
110:16
enjoy and have fun every planet will be
110:18
different and you won't need a spacesuit
110:20
or a spaceship to go there you'll be
110:23
timeless this is a beautiful future
110:28
isn't it so this little bit of time that
110:32
we are on this earth but we will get to
110:36
do supernatural the Bible says will be a
110:40
type and group of people a generation a
110:42
type and group of people those are those
110:46
manifested sons and daughters of God it
110:49
wasn't about Israel becoming a nation I
110:51
know a lot of people think that
110:52
generation was the generation they would
110:56
still be here when Jesus came but a lot
110:57
of them I've already died moved to
110:58
heaven haven't they that was in 1948 is
111:03
that correct
111:03
Rick got that one
111:10
in 1948 a miracle happened in Israel do
111:15
what I'll fix my fix it is it falling
111:19
off thank you for telling me honey I
111:23
just I pinned my scars down these little
111:25
scarves they'd be all the way on the
111:27
floor I'd walk around with one little
111:29
piece up here and it's on the floor I'm
111:30
draggin and nobody ever told me nobody
111:33
ever said oh my your scarf is swimming
111:34
off of you so my team have little signs
111:39
you see they give but you know he just
111:43
kinda lets it go sometimes so we have
111:48
been chosen by God to be here or you
111:51
wouldn't be alive and sitting there
111:53
people go maybe I wasn't chosen are you
111:55
alive are you breathing were you born in
111:58
this time you were chosen you were
112:03
chosen and you're representing all those
112:05
who went before you and you don't know
112:07
who lived a thousand years ago maybe you
112:09
do maybe you don't know but somewhere in
112:12
your generational line was someone who
112:14
laid down their life for the gospel and
112:16
what he is doing is putting on the earth
112:20
right now those who generational line
112:23
somewhere lay down their life for the
112:26
gospel so don't say you didn't have
112:29
anybody you had somebody or you wouldn't
112:32
be sitting here we get to help complete
112:35
their destiny because he gives a destiny
112:39
or a purpose for a generational line and
112:42
even though they didn't get to complete
112:45
it they started it they share and the
112:50
same reward we got that's why they're so
112:54
excited that you're here right now you
112:57
are remember the body of Christ you are
112:59
going to reap reward for you and them
113:02
and they watch you do it they won't miss
113:06
one time that you win someone to the
113:09
Lord they won't miss one time that you
113:11
manifest for God in this earth they will
113:13
see all of it because we have a cloud of
113:16
witnesses
113:18
is that right according to Hebrews 12:1
113:21
we have a great cloud of witnesses
113:24
watching our race
113:25
that means they get to see it and
113:28
they're excited and they're all cheering
113:29
heaven is cheering they laugh every time
113:33
Satan fails and he can hear them all the
113:37
way down into hell and heaven roared the
113:42
other day they're gonna roar on November
113:48
6 so I've really enjoyed this time with
114:00
y'all I hope you were blessed by heaven
114:02
amen amen
114:09
and so just we never I told you all
114:11
these things that I will be working God
114:14
walked in the wall through the wall of
114:16
my hotel room a couple months ago and he
114:20
wrote on the wall literally what I'd be
114:23
doing for the next 50 years that's not
114:25
the end of my assignment but he wrote
114:28
for 50 years the platforms I would speak
114:30
from the very first one he was switching
114:33
now don't be concerned I've been
114:35
spending years many years revealing
114:38
heaven but I'm in my next phase which is
114:41
creating heaven to put in the
114:44
marketplace a lot of people heard me
114:45
talk about this a while we literally are
114:47
this year starting to put things in the
114:51
marketplace that look like heaven sound
114:52
like heaven you'll be eating off of it
114:55
wearing it walking on it listening to it
114:58
you'll have walls that move and say
115:00
things that's in heaven and so we're
115:05
doing that now so he changed and
115:07
switched my priority number one is the
115:10
business world the marketplace the
115:13
business world being CEO and putting
115:15
stuff in the marketplace it represents
115:17
heaven that this people really people in
115:19
this world need that because right now
115:21
Satan has put his mark on everything you
115:24
wear it you have to stand you look at it
115:26
it's in design it's an interior design
115:28
architectural design it's in clothing
115:30
it's an accessories it's in-home stuff
115:32
isn't everything it's in all the schools
115:35
it's everywhere so God is now putting
115:38
heaven there amen
115:40
and you can have things that represent
115:42
in heaven and so I have to do that or we
115:46
won't be there I'm not saying other
115:47
people won't do it but we will majorly
115:49
be impacting this world amen and number
115:53
two will still be revealing heaven and
115:55
training the body of Christ but number
115:57
three will be the arts and entertainment
116:00
world which means Hollywood
116:03
so I will be seeing many times with
116:07
celebrities in Hollywood directors
116:09
producers and don't do it a lot about
116:12
the Christians do oh my gosh that
116:13
person's over there talking to Holly bit
116:15
they're gonna go down the hole
116:16
no Hollywood's changing how it was
116:21
changing what they're gonna produce what
116:22
they're gonna put out there what they're
116:23
gonna market and even places of
116:26
entertainment never had before and earth
116:27
will be created for you to go and have
116:28
good family fun Amen new hotel designs
116:33
it's in it's totally invaded with heaven
116:36
that the stuff in the rooms the stuff in
116:38
the walls the stuff displayed there the
116:40
things you can do while you're there
116:42
it's all changing whole amusement parks
116:46
will be lined up with what heaven is
116:48
doing in the earth right now video games
116:51
will be shown that young people can be
116:53
part of working with heavens army
116:56
destroying the darkness pushing back you
116:57
know the evil and these video games
117:00
instead of being invaded by hell they'll
117:02
be invaded by heaven all kinds of things
117:06
whatever young people like we're making
117:08
it with heaven in it and so we all will
117:12
have movies in the movie theaters that
117:15
show a lot about heaven of time of the
117:18
spirit round the spirit realm the spirit
117:20
world they want the spirit realm they
117:23
want that unseen realm they're so hungry
117:24
for the unseen realm it's not a fake
117:27
it's not a fantasy you know they'll stop
117:31
running after maybe so superheroes for a
117:34
while but definitely aliens will be put
117:36
on the back burner although some of the
117:39
hosts look like them
117:42
so I just want to thank you for come
117:45
tomorrow I have another powerful message
117:47
to give to encourage and inspire you
117:49
it's gonna be amazing
117:51
you're gonna get some protocol from
117:53
heaven on how to work with the army of
117:56
heaven and things about your life to be
117:59
accountable so that you can work with
118:01
them because tell you heaven I know they
118:04
hear the prayers of sinners people think
118:05
they don't but they do
118:06
he hears the prayers of sinners he
118:09
couldn't he couldn't answer them amen
118:11
heaven here's everybody's words but the
118:15
army is not going to listen to someone
118:19
trying to command them when they're
118:19
sinning when they're sweating people
118:22
you're not going to do it they will stay
118:25
in there and stare at you so if you want
118:28
to be a part of using them as one of
118:30
your spiritual weapons and sending them
118:32
all over this world the potent
118:33
strongholds of darkness expose the
118:35
wicked people themselves take them down
118:38
not kill them
118:40
unless they have to I will let you know
118:43
this that I do know like for Cavanaugh
118:46
God is releasing ho
118:50
I'm trying remember what do you call
118:52
like a truth beam a group of military
118:56
like what aliens yeah he's sending ho
118:59
battalions of the hosts that have flesh
119:01
on them and they were the ones that
119:03
fought against the armies of Israel they
119:06
actually fought in the flesh and fought
119:09
against the flesh they are being
119:11
released into this earth to keep the
119:14
lives of those who say yes who say who
119:18
are willing who are bidden who say yes
119:20
and who live your life the way we should
119:23
is an example of Christ so there are
119:25
things gonna be change I'll be talking

00:01
let's welcome cat everyone up here okay
00:28
being the mother of three highly
00:32
anointed dancers who were born years
00:35
apart from each other
00:37
I planned mine being 1:15 I thought if I
00:40
ever have them being number three out of
00:44
15 I said if I ever have them I'm
00:47
planning them on purpose far apart so I
00:51
can enjoy my life in between and get to
00:54
know each one of them so I did I had
00:56
them five years apart within the same
00:59
month but five years apart except the
01:03
middle one
01:03
I needed seven years before I had to
01:06
turn off but God was amazing he gave
01:10
them all the exact same gift their
01:14
natural gift they will still use in
01:16
heaven is dance they've danced probably
01:18
some of them for 30 years some 25 years
01:21
and highly gifted they've raised the
01:24
debt by dancing they've had people more
01:27
actually healed by dancing they do
01:29
intercession and warfare by dancing so
01:32
much so that my middle daughter has
01:35
brass knuckles this big tattooed on the
01:37
top of her feet because there are
01:39
weapons of God God told her to do it and
01:43
so everywhere she goes she would have
01:45
pink hair purple hair she was on so you
01:47
think you could dance so she could
01:49
witness and testifies to the judges
01:51
because she had already been dancing
01:52
since she was four so what I think she's
01:55
like 20 something after 20 years of
01:58
dance she went said I'm going to testify
02:00
I know they won't put me all the way
02:02
through because I'll be preaching the
02:04
gospel at one point and they passed her
02:07
through every test she mentored sixty
02:09
other dancers who were going to be
02:11
trying out because they all had to wait
02:13
in a room
02:13
for five days as you waited for your
02:15
turn and the first day you showed up
02:18
they they gave you a test they played
02:20
music for 10 seconds have you passed
02:22
those judges you were in for the rest of
02:24
the thing and so every level she would
02:27
pass every level so she got her try on
02:29
the platform so she could testify and
02:32
her here at that time was cut a little
02:34
bit shorter but it was red with purple
02:36
overtones and she had her she had a Rose
02:40
of Sharon on her arm her brass knuckles
02:43
on her feet and it was modern dance so
02:45
she didn't have to wear shoes and this
02:48
was her moment they played the music and
02:50
she dances so powerfully anointed people
02:53
just sit there like stunned they don't
02:55
know what to do they don't know what it
02:56
is so they said and the whole time she's
02:59
preparing what she was going to save
03:01
them and so they said well we know who
03:04
you are you must be really hot they said
03:09
the wrong word so why are you here look
03:12
at you your cool tattoos and she stood
03:15
up with her moment she said you think
03:17
you know who I am but I'm a believer in
03:20
Jesus Christ I get my anointing from him
03:24
I dance and warfare and worship I
03:27
destroy the darkness through my
03:29
movements I make every movement I make
03:32
us for him it is to worship Him he is my
03:35
God I will serve no other and they all
03:40
were sitting there stunned and they
03:44
finally said we can't pass you through
03:45
nope nope nope nope we can't pleasure
03:48
they were so terrified thinking she
03:51
would do that while she did it on stage
03:52
she said I did not come to win I came to
03:57
testify to you that God has young people
04:00
in this earth so down on fire for him
04:03
who will not compromise with the world
04:06
but will make a stand for righteousness
04:07
and holiness and that's why I came and I
04:11
fulfilled my commission
04:15
and they centered and all of the younger
04:18
people cuz you know they're like what
04:20
1718 cent like that and they were so
04:23
angry because she was so powerful that
04:25
wasn't fair she said I didn't come to
04:27
win and every day they meet in this room
04:31
and they'd all get tweaked you know they
04:32
do their their thing trying to get
04:34
better
04:35
she helped every one of them with their
04:37
with their routines and she would make
04:39
them pray first and these kids were from
04:43
all over the world in every walk of life
04:46
in every ethnic group and they learned
04:49
to pray to Jesus and she was um she's
04:52
don't you ever stop praying he gave you
04:55
that gift I'll be rooting for every one
04:56
of you and so this is the heart of my
05:00
daughter's this is what they were raised
05:02
in that that was who they were they
05:05
weren't something else they never went
05:07
into the world to find out who they were
05:09
they knew they all still dance they all
05:12
still minister they performed some have
05:14
dance companies and and they're very
05:17
powerful and I'm blessed that God said
05:19
if you raise up in child and the way he
05:21
made them to be they will never depart
05:24
from that because it's knowing their
05:26
gift and being that gift so I love dance
05:29
I have 20 years of videos of taping I
05:33
was the videographer I don't have a clue
05:36
about dance myself I can't dance except
05:39
in one day and so I teach everybody when
05:40
they go somewhere I've been throwing out
05:42
a Jazzercise classes so that shows you
05:44
that was not my gift but we got to see
05:48
all these years of them using that gift
05:52
they never dropped it and one of them
05:54
has actually danced here before Kim my
05:57
daughter Kim and she wants to come back
06:01
she's gonna help me talk to you about
06:03
doing an arts a whole arts it's called
06:06
arts alive and they'll she'll teach
06:09
dance they have artists that will teach
06:11
art and they have others that will teach
06:13
worship you know powerful it's powerful
06:17
it's like a two day event and and people
06:20
come in for the first time learn how to
06:22
express yourself and dance so she has
06:24
two classes one for those who have
06:25
experience and those who have no
06:27
experience and you'll never be the same
06:29
again and like the fine art is beautiful
06:32
and amazing they teach you prophetic art
06:34
like with brushes and paints and stuff
06:36
and then the worship thing is phenomenal
06:38
and these are all experts in their field
06:40
professionals in their field and Kim
06:42
said as it was leaving mom make sure you
06:45
asked them and see if they want us to
06:47
come you know we would love to come yeah
06:52
she wants to very much come and do that
06:54
so I'll have to let her know the answers
06:56
yes but when they started because dance
07:00
is one of the hottest things done in the
07:02
throne room it's called in sums 149 it's
07:06
high praise read Psalms 149 it talks
07:10
about dance being high praise it binds
07:12
the enemy in fetters of iron it's a very
07:16
powerful weapon it is worship but it's
07:19
also warfare and I want you to know when
07:22
they first started the fire started
07:25
pouring down from heaven blue fire blue
07:28
fire was coming down all over this
07:30
platform it was around every single
07:32
dancer and then about halfway through
07:34
the line of Judah walked in that wall
07:37
right here huge lion it was Jesus and
07:41
receiving the honor and the praise they
07:44
were all dancing around him they didn't
07:46
couldn't probably see that the other
07:48
thing that happened was I almost never
07:50
see this but the Seraphim showed up the
07:54
Seraphim live over the throne in a cloud
07:58
of glory and they come down and they do
08:01
dance in the air above the throne their
08:03
heads are so on fire with blue fire
08:06
their hair is blue fire and they were
08:09
right up here in between these two areas
08:11
right here and they would dip down
08:13
and bring more release more fire in here
08:15
on the dancers so the throat the
08:18
throne-room was here today okay
08:20
receiving the honor and the praise from
08:23
the dancers it's a very glorious thing
08:25
in heaven to see that happen and so I
08:28
was delighted when I came and they
08:31
danced cuz I love to see that I love to
08:33
see it's very powerful and so truly one
08:37
of their dance directors was very ill
08:40
one time and so my oldest daughter and
08:42
my middle daughter who actually ended up
08:45
by teaching and taken over the studio
08:47
for a while
08:48
danced and she was raised up off her
08:50
deathbed and they did it for that
08:53
purpose they were interceding for her to
08:55
be made whole and she lived she was
08:58
raised up from the dead and she lived
09:00
another 10 years a wonderful the first
09:04
Christian dance company in our entire
09:06
city the company became 200 members in
09:09
the company and then the director needed
09:11
a new knee so my oldest daughter took
09:13
over the company and three studios and
09:16
worked all over for her and gave her all
09:18
the money and so because she loved her
09:21
because from the time she was 8 she had
09:23
taught her she used to dance the the
09:25
director with the New York City Ballet
09:27
and she had danced all over the world we
09:29
decided at one point I'm done with this
09:32
I'm giving myself to Jesus and she got
09:34
saved and came and started the father's
09:36
company and so powerfully effective
09:39
impacted our whole city and now Miss
09:42
Laury is in heaven watching right now so
09:45
so dance is something wonderful if
09:48
you're if you're any of your children
09:50
they had some guys that did too they
09:52
didn't wear tutus at anymore tights but
09:55
they were powerful dancers also and I
09:58
know people you say dance a picture all
09:59
ballet there's many other forms of dance
10:01
you know that they can be involved in
10:03
and and I loved it with your I was
10:07
trying to remember what the father calls
10:09
it and with your battle stick he calls
10:12
it a battle stick they have those in the
10:15
throne rooms and the men are the ones
10:17
who use them in the zone
10:19
I'm like wow they really got heaven here
10:22
today and some of you may not even
10:24
understand what I'm talking about but
10:26
it's a powerful thing to connect with
10:27
heaven and then you duplicate it down
10:30
here okay so if you don't have a church
10:33
this is a powerful place to come god
10:35
loves this place not that he doesn't
10:37
love other places but they give
10:39
everything to him their lives their
10:42
gifts and they do it on purpose and
10:44
intentionally and they're passionate
10:46
about it God loves to see passion and
10:49
his people he loves it when you respond
10:52
when you yell when you get excited when
10:54
you jump up and down he loves let me
10:57
tell you heaven is not a quiet place if
11:00
you're expecting it to change your
11:03
mindset because if you're 80 you won't
11:07
feel 80 in heaven you'd be like 20 and
11:10
if you're already young when you get
11:12
there you are so excited beyond reason
11:15
the things that you get to experience
11:16
and do in heaven they don't even have on
11:18
this earth heaven is not earth the earth
11:21
is only a shadow literally a shadow of
11:24
what is in heaven it's way beyond your
11:27
imagination don't ever limit God in your
11:30
lives even here not even here and so
11:33
never thought I would be chosen to do
11:35
this not ever in my wildest dreams I
11:38
didn't like talking to anybody I didn't
11:42
want anybody to hug me or touch me I was
11:47
a covert person from the beginning and
11:49
yet had to be a leader at age eight over
11:53
my siblings and help and then when as I
11:55
got older it just increased but I was a
11:57
very faithful and committed to help my
11:59
parents I was on my parents side that
12:02
did not make me popular with the rest of
12:05
my siblings and being a seer and having
12:08
supernatural discernment even when I'm
12:10
like eight nine and ten they didn't get
12:12
away with anything
12:13
I was literally know what they were
12:15
gonna do before they even got to do it
12:17
okay and so I've met and go retrieve
12:19
them or whatever they were thought they
12:20
were going to get into it never happened
12:22
and my mom would always say I'm leaving
12:24
you to be in charge the house will still
12:26
be here they won't burn it down
12:29
you know they won't have fights in the
12:31
streets I mean when you got that many
12:32
kids together and that many
12:34
personalities there's gonna be a lot of
12:35
action all the time
12:37
and so uh and in my husband that God
12:40
made me marry he said this is one I
12:43
chose before you were born this is who I
12:45
chose to you to marry I need you to
12:47
marry him I need the holy seed you're
12:49
gonna produce I mean this is how direct
12:51
God is with me how detailed he is with
12:53
me and he said you're gonna have three
12:55
daughters and I need them born into this
12:58
earth I tried to get out of having the
13:00
last one that didn't happen I am paid in
13:05
full right now okay
13:07
and I only have one that's not married
13:09
yet and she thinks you might want to be
13:12
I'm not quite sure about that we'll see
13:14
what happens nothing is for certain when
13:18
God's involved in your life and he's got
13:20
destiny for you he'll get you one way or
13:23
another okay and that is a that's a good
13:26
thing it's a god thing be excited for
13:29
your life he could have had you born 300
13:31
years ago nobody would be dressed the
13:34
way you're dressed nobody would have any
13:37
of the conveniences of things you would
13:38
have you know you'd be climbing on some
13:40
old wagon train hauling around behind
13:42
cow dung and flies whatever you find and
13:46
caught that's what you ate you might
13:49
have a bath once every three months no
13:51
tell me where that would take place and
13:53
I for one I always thank God that he had
13:56
me born now if it had not been the kind
14:01
of person I didn't like getting dirty I
14:02
didn't want to get wet I didn't like to
14:05
sweat that was me so shoving me back 300
14:10
years ago I've probably not have been a
14:11
happy person and so I'm always grateful
14:15
that I'm born in this special time on
14:17
the earth well we will see things never
14:20
seen before
14:21
on the earth really some things will
14:24
directly be sent from heaven right in
14:27
our midst in the most unusual unexpected
14:30
places a lot of these signs and wonders
14:34
will not be done even in the midst of a
14:36
huge big meeting with thousands of
14:39
people it may be done in your grocery
14:41
stores
14:41
[Music]
14:43
you may take you out through the wall in
14:47
the grocery store your left your cart
14:49
will be left behind take you somewhere
14:51
do some miraculous thing out bring you
14:53
back your your kosher cart will still be
14:55
there trust me nobody will take anything
14:59
out of it and these things will be so
15:02
spectacular he actually does intend to
15:04
use you he's not looking for holy
15:08
recruits out of some of the highest
15:10
known people you know they're all
15:11
important they did what they did in the
15:14
past but in this time God wants teams
15:16
and groups of people who are willing to
15:18
work together even though we're
15:20
different no don't wait for everything
15:23
trust me we have a team don't wait for
15:26
every person to line up with the way you
15:28
think they should be okay if God sent
15:33
them he sent them and he sent them for a
15:36
reason and you have to love all them and
15:39
let them use the gifts God put in them
15:41
and be excited about it because if all
15:44
you ever do is complain about those
15:46
people they're probably never gonna
15:48
change okay when you can be happy about
15:51
them and ask God to bless them you
15:54
actually be surprised at how wonderful
15:56
they are so you can't expect because
16:00
he's a powerful days that everything
16:02
will look perfect or be perfect it will
16:04
be powerful and there's a big difference
16:08
between perfect and powerful it will be
16:10
so powerful when we start coming
16:12
together and doing things when God says
16:15
to do it not wait five years to do it
16:17
but do it he said pray that my people
16:19
are willing in the day of my power that
16:23
means lay down your differences
16:25
you know don't wait for everything to be
16:27
perfect because we aren't any of us
16:30
actually perfect right we're all a work
16:33
in progress but if you have a passion
16:34
for him and what he wants and he brings
16:37
other people to be a part of that you
16:39
should be very excited I get excited all
16:42
the time although our whole group I
16:44
don't know of anybody who's perfect know
16:46
they're all still working on I'm still
16:49
working on it and so as long as you're
16:51
going in a forward motion
16:53
and not sitting and waiting on the side
16:55
you're gonna do something for God right
16:59
so I can tell you God is opening more
17:01
and more the eyes of the everyday
17:03
believer to begin to see into the spirit
17:06
realm because it's coming people go well
17:10
you say things yes I do say things and
17:12
because I do prophesy that might be in
17:15
that in the past that could been 10 or
17:16
20 years but that's not happening now I
17:18
know things I said seven years ago are
17:21
literally happening right now things God
17:24
showed me I would be doing is happening
17:26
now and that now is going to open up the
17:29
whole rest of the floodgate for a lot of
17:31
other things just to start accelerating
17:33
we've been in and accelerating the
17:35
season but more now in the not just the
17:38
acceleration but we're being motivated
17:39
to be thrown out there don't look in the
17:45
mirror and say I don't qualify don't
17:47
ever say that word
17:48
you know why you qualify you're alive
17:53
guy said if you're still alive and
17:56
you're not in heaven yet you belong to
17:59
him you're qualified okay the world
18:03
won't we choose people that they think
18:06
qualified but God qualifies the chosen
18:11
it matters what he says about us it
18:14
matters how why he made us okay so no
18:18
matter what you think about yourself he
18:20
qualifies you I was just a little skinny
18:24
girl they didn't blend well with other
18:27
people at one point my line I think I
18:29
talked to two people in all of high
18:31
school they didn't really know who I was
18:33
but I was not the person they probably
18:36
thought I was I did a lot of covert
18:38
things even for the law they never would
18:41
have expected me the last person I'm
18:44
playing earth that they thought could
18:45
have done some of the things I did and
18:47
yet God qualifies me and I said yes
18:51
every time he asked me something and I
18:53
didn't always have the best attitude
18:55
growing up I wasn't happy about most
18:57
things I didn't like almost no food I
18:59
never slept I mean I was a lot of high
19:01
maintenance for my mom and she'll assure
19:03
you of that if she was here right now
19:05
she would tell me live
19:07
every day in my life of a strange
19:10
because I didn't fit the rest of the
19:13
group you know everybody ate everything
19:15
they slept normal they did what was
19:18
expected I never did anything that was
19:20
expected
19:21
I ate once a day that was about 1:00 or
19:23
2:00 in the morning while everybody was
19:24
sleeping I sleep four hours a day so I'm
19:28
up 20 hours a day what was I gonna do
19:30
for the extra time I read I was an avid
19:33
reader I read things that were exciting
19:35
and interesting I'm an avid horse lover
19:38
although I don't know one I'm sure I
19:40
have a herd in heaven and I was
19:43
fascinated with him you know in the
19:45
Bible God talks so much about the horse
19:46
he thinks it's one of the best things he
19:48
ever made in the animal kingdom he loves
19:52
horses and we're kind of in horse
19:55
country right now right I plan one day
19:58
to have a range somewhere around here
19:59
with a whole lot of horses I'm not
20:04
making that up and serious about that I
20:06
can come and visit my friends and get
20:10
away I'll have to get away to places
20:12
already planned in Maine because God
20:14
said the demand will be so great he'll
20:16
have to just take me and I'm perfectly
20:20
happy with that - so get ready to not be
20:23
normal or think normal and and I will
20:26
tell you just watch out for the quiet
20:28
ones you have a child that's quiet there
20:33
a very deep thinker and God has put a
20:36
lot in them and I always know when I
20:39
look around see people real quiet mm-hmm
20:44
God is gonna do something with you and
20:46
stick you out there in front of
20:48
everybody
20:51
because I was the core I was the quiet
20:53
when I hardly said anything but all the
20:56
time things were going on and the spirit
20:57
around me and so I'm excited today to be
21:01
here I have given up so much already
21:03
last night was so powerful
21:07
it was phenomenal it was so powerful it
21:11
really was it was amazing and so I
21:15
always like to ask how many people have
21:16
never heard me before that are here
21:18
today any new people a couple people
21:22
well I don't look normal
21:26
unless you live in a kurta certain
21:29
states couple states you know maybe
21:31
Portland they have a lot of highlights
21:32
in their hair some places in California
21:35
do but I learned not everybody does
21:37
I learn literally last week for a whole
21:41
week was in Hollywood going over a
21:44
contract to get a spirit round content
21:47
for a movie being made right now and
21:50
that is the resurrection of Jesus Christ
21:52
to put things in there that people have
21:56
seen in the Bible but maybe didn't have
21:57
revelation on it it will be live on the
22:01
big screen and people will be shocked
22:04
and stunned to know what Christ did in
22:07
hell on the third day any man how he
22:10
wasted hell in their leader is gonna be
22:13
very powerful and just in case anybody
22:16
wondered God loves colored highlights in
22:18
your hair because you're wearing heaven
22:21
culture this is heaven culture on my
22:24
head when a lot of people go why you do
22:26
that you know some places in Florida
22:29
have highlights that I don't think West
22:30
Virginia
22:34
not much in South Carolina you know
22:38
unless you're a headline or somewhere
22:39
maybe but when I used to travel through
22:42
those areas they would come out of the
22:43
kitchen they would come out of the
22:46
kitchen where they were cooking to see
22:48
who I was when it would stop but there
22:50
were little barbecue places or something
22:52
like that they all would get around my
22:53
table and I'm just waiting for their
22:55
little but we had a meeting right there
22:58
and it was all talking about heaven and
23:00
how they lived in heaven and how
23:02
exciting powerful was and they walked
23:04
away so stunned you know oh my god am i
23:07
lights in heaven and we can't have them
23:09
where we work I want to start prayin it
23:12
is coming it's gonna become normal just
23:15
like pierced ears if you weren't around
23:17
in that day they thought you were gonna
23:19
go straight to hell if you pierced ears
23:21
because you were doing idol worship you
23:23
know like back in Leviticus well we
23:25
don't live in Leviticus days and I
23:28
always like to correct people the way
23:30
they quote scriptures although some of
23:31
the translations now actually says don't
23:34
realize yourself to be tattooed they
23:36
mistranslated that because what it says
23:38
no Leviticus it says do not marks do not
23:40
allow marks of the Dead to be put on
23:43
your body they didn't say don't mark
23:45
yourself you have marks in heaven that
23:49
God puts on you it's what you put on you
23:52
and the reason you put them on you and I
23:54
have to say that even though people
23:56
might be uncomfortable you may be living
23:58
in heaven a point at one point wondering
24:00
why God ever said that and then you'll
24:01
get some yourself but it's coming
24:05
because as we go through time in it's a
24:08
new time
24:09
new things are introduced on the earth
24:11
some men kind of comes goes along with
24:14
but some of them actually come from
24:15
heaven and God at one point will ask
24:17
people personally to put his marks on
24:21
them like my daughter
24:22
the brass knuckles on her feet that was
24:24
before that actually was going around in
24:26
our city and and she wore sandals in
24:30
Florida where foot flops or sandals so
24:31
nobody could miss them right and they
24:33
knew what she did but when they looked
24:35
down on her feet Oh
24:36
do you know you like I don't know your
24:40
daughter has tattoos of the enemy oh no
24:43
no that's evidence that she's a gift to
24:46
crush the enemy that's what those are
24:49
there for so for all of you who ever
24:52
wondered about that God will mark you
24:54
when you get to heaven it says in the
24:56
Bible that you'll have the mark of the
24:58
city of your God in your forehead and
25:00
your God in the palm of your hand which
25:03
is why Satan wants to use those same two
25:06
places in the tribulation why did he
25:09
pick those two places it clearly says
25:11
that that that number of the item to
25:14
Christ will be in your palm or in your
25:17
forehead he only picks what God already
25:20
has you can't think of anything new
25:23
himself the microchip is not the mark of
25:27
the beast and neither is the barcode
25:31
which they thought it was before the
25:33
chip came along for forever and ever
25:36
mankind has tried to picture it so
25:38
usually in a tract of stuff they just
25:40
put a big 666 on the forehead or the
25:43
person that in the Bible track to
25:45
explain that this was someone who gave
25:47
themselves to Satan in the in those days
25:49
that haven't come yet and aren't going
25:50
to be for quite a while but the barcode
25:53
and the microchip especially in
25:55
microchip does it wouldn't count you
25:58
can't see it say Amen I know if enough
26:02
about Satan that whatever he does pick
26:04
will be this big you see a half a mile
26:07
away people walking down the street
26:08
because he is adamant about being known
26:11
and wanted and that day people will have
26:15
to want that mark no one can be forced
26:18
at gunpoint to take it a lot of these
26:21
movies they show about the last days
26:23
they show people in in cells with guns
26:25
and stuff threatening them to get it
26:27
that won't happen
26:28
that's not reality reality is they will
26:31
have to choose him as their leader and
26:33
that is a result of choosing the
26:37
Antichrist or Satan as their leader that
26:39
mark that will be clearly seen on the
26:42
people will be put on them so forget the
26:45
microchip it's just a good science you
26:48
know thing to help find people and
26:50
your pets and stuff or maybe save the
26:52
fact that you don't have to carry
26:53
wallets around with you they're always
26:55
going to be coming up with new
26:57
technology no one has technology like
26:59
heaven okay so don't worry about it it's
27:03
not your job to be concerned about any
27:05
of that and God wouldn't let you take
27:06
something that wasn't him anyway you
27:09
have to remember that you belong to him
27:11
you gave yourself to him that is not
27:13
gonna be something that's hidden when
27:15
that day comes it will not be hidden the
27:18
people who live in that time will
27:20
clearly know what they're saying no to
27:22
or what they're accepting your job is to
27:25
rule and reign in the power of the
27:27
Living God and ways never done before
27:29
you're living in one of those exciting
27:31
times to be alive on the planet and the
27:34
Bible says if people who live in heaven
27:37
could come back it would only be to do
27:38
that with you to be a part of this time
27:42
doing the supernatural manifesting for
27:45
your God on this earth the rain erasing
27:48
the great area that says there is not a
27:49
God so that's what they would come back
27:52
for amen but you're here you're here
27:56
you're in this meeting and you'll be
27:59
held accountable by knowing that you
28:02
were chosen you're breathing you're
28:05
alive you're not in heaven okay so he's
28:08
letting anyone who wants to to be a part
28:11
of what he's doing in this earth you
28:12
just have to understand don't try to
28:14
escape don't think that you can live out
28:16
the time waiting for the rapture to come
28:19
and I am NOT saying it's not coming he
28:23
is clearly going to come back when the
28:25
father sends him what Christ wants you
28:28
to do is operate in his power say his
28:32
power supernatural power in front of
28:37
others to demonstrate there is a God so
28:44
in the past people were you know they go
28:47
door to door and you can still do that
28:48
minister to people when people - cries
28:50
it's gonna be done a little bit
28:53
differently not that we'll ever be
28:54
stopped but there's a lot of people
28:57
who've already been approached people in
28:59
this day a lot of them know things that
29:02
people never knew in the past
29:03
a lot of its the internet has been used
29:05
for a lot of God not just evil and that
29:07
was made by God for His purposes it was
29:09
never made to be evil but Satan gets
29:11
involved in every single thing he can
29:13
get away with don't let him get away
29:15
with anything with you okay I love what
29:19
she's helping she said that I say that
29:21
to him if I see him a lot who are you
29:23
fooling because I don't belong to you
29:26
I'm talking about Satan appearing I
29:28
don't belong to you why are you here
29:31
you're wasting your time I know I have
29:35
authority I know I have power over all
29:37
the power of you and all of yours so you
29:41
don't waste your time coming here and
29:44
then he leaves because I put myself
29:48
under the hand of God no I'm not afraid
29:52
of anything I've already been told by
29:58
God if anybody tries to take me my life
30:00
they will not let them and if you know
30:05
somebody wants to take your life I will
30:07
not allow you to pray for them that
30:09
means they're in very big trouble
30:13
so I don't have any fear and I'm willing
30:16
whatever God wants however long he wants
30:18
to say whatever he wants and I'll have a
30:21
great opportunity to do that now I'm
30:23
because of but I'll be involved in I'll
30:25
get to meet kings and CEOs and
30:27
millionaires and I promise you they'll
30:30
hear from God Hollywood's gonna have a
30:35
lot of God in it amen and I was just a
30:42
little skinny girl that's what I was as
30:45
what people thought it was and then
30:46
later on when I got involved in my
30:49
church I loved my church I served in my
30:51
church I loved my pastor and his wife
30:54
I was very committed and sold out to
30:56
them and one day God had me write a
30:59
letter and say I was married to them
31:01
and they read that letter in church she
31:03
didn't read my name and they wept and
31:05
they said we wished everyone here loved
31:07
us that much that they were committed to
31:10
hold up our hands to pray for us every
31:12
day to help us in any way they wanted to
31:15
I was serious
31:16
God sent me there to be a blessing amen
31:19
that meant scrubbing the floors working
31:21
in children's church doing VBS I have
31:24
another word for that and won't tell you
31:26
what I think about that it's a killing
31:29
station not for the kids question when
31:40
you're stuck with the 7 year old so 8
31:42
year old the three and four year olds
31:44
were easy when you start thinking you
31:47
have a mind of your own it changes this
31:52
one little boy I had was like a thorn in
31:54
my flesh
31:56
he always had a better idea it did not
31:58
matter what we had prepared in VBS you
32:01
have to have if you are not prepared you
32:03
will have in our key and mayhem you will
32:07
be overthrown like a government by well
32:13
prepared children so you have to have
32:16
exciting fun things for them to do but
32:18
this one kid always had a better idea
32:22
every single name was Micah I should
32:25
have been suspecting he always wanted to
32:28
do it his way which was messing up the
32:30
plan that kid is such a peril of each
32:34
list
32:36
go is SiC him on the devil he's very
32:41
powerful when man I guess it was worth
32:44
it
32:44
loving him anyway it is fun to see those
32:49
you help as children be raised up and be
32:52
so powerful to forgot I'm gonna I knew
32:54
you were gonna become something so it's
33:00
wonderful to have a life sewn to God
33:04
even in your in perfectness even in your
33:07
mistakes even in all those things God
33:10
looks at your heart and he loves every
33:15
one of you even if you feel alone
33:18
yourself you are not alone you have
33:22
angels around you everyone here has
33:25
angels everyone in here has probably at
33:27
least 3 to 5 angels you don't have just
33:31
one some of you have a lot and most of
33:36
them are very happy right now that
33:37
you're sitting in those seats because
33:41
every word ice because anointing in it
33:43
and it goes in your soul whether you
33:44
know that or not the words won't leave
33:47
your soul because God wants you to know
33:51
you are powerfully made you are so
33:55
powerfully made if you ever really saw
33:58
who you were you would be so bold the
34:01
devil would get so terrified he doesn't
34:04
attack you because he's afraid he
34:07
doesn't attack you because he's angry he
34:12
doesn't get angry he's too smart to be
34:16
angry he knows what happens when he
34:17
makes people angry
34:19
he's gets you stuck but he does attack
34:24
you because he's terrified of you and
34:27
he's hoping you never ever find out who
34:31
you are
34:33
I've even said this in a men's prison
34:38
Danone Yin began to hit every one of
34:40
them the anointing they carried because
34:42
you got you're given an anointing for
34:45
some purpose they're very anointing
34:46
begin I can see it begin to rise out and
34:49
come and discover them and they begin to
34:51
weep they begin to shake they never
34:53
thought of their self that way I'm sure
34:55
nobody ever came and told them that
34:57
their treasures hidden in darkness so
35:01
when light comes in and removes the
35:03
scales off of their eyes then they get
35:06
angry at Satan even though they know
35:11
what they did was wrong and they're
35:12
paying a price for that they get
35:14
anything that he trapped him he trapped
35:16
them he hunted them he got them to fall
35:20
he kept encouraging them to do wrong
35:22
then he made them get caught how about
35:26
man he might have been put away where
35:29
they would never get to be who they were
35:32
sent to be and every time I go speak
35:36
everything every one of the men got
35:38
saved filled with the Holy Spirit and
35:39
then I really saw fire of God into them
35:41
I said whatever God has planned for you
35:45
you can be powerful right here you can
35:47
make a difference right here don't you
35:48
let one demon show their face in this
35:50
place don't you let them think they have
35:52
authority over you belong to Jesus
35:54
Christ you are now a weapon for God in
35:57
this place and sometimes ho blocks and
36:01
the prison would get saved including the
36:04
warden because of these people running
36:08
after Jesus Christ letting him work
36:11
Foley through them even in the prisons
36:15
there's gonna be movement from the
36:17
prison's one day
36:20
so maybe you're not in a building but
36:22
you're in a prison don't stay there
36:28
god I declare every person in this room
36:31
right now that has been chosen by you
36:34
that belongs to you that has a divine
36:36
purpose I take power over all the part
36:39
of the enemy trying to control any of
36:40
them steal their destiny crush them beat
36:43
them up in Jesus name I command the
36:45
hosts of heaven you get in here right
36:46
now
36:47
you pull down every stronghold you shred
36:51
every platform
36:52
Satan's been running over in their lives
36:54
right now that they might be free free
36:57
free everybody out free free in Jesus
37:00
name Amen amen that's how you pray over
37:07
your family get serious about it
37:11
amen then celebrate because your words
37:15
are powerful they have life in them they
37:17
have power in them if Christ lives in
37:20
you when you speak it's like him
37:21
speaking amen so you are important to
37:26
God every person is important there was
37:30
a lot of them messed up out there they
37:32
don't even know who he is don't know how
37:35
much he loves them but the moves that
37:38
are coming in the habitation that is
37:39
coming to this earth they will know he's
37:44
going to move on every single person
37:46
without permission I know you said well
37:51
they have to have permission sometimes
37:52
they do sometimes things are sovereignly
37:53
done and this already been declared in
37:56
the world in the last days what does he
38:00
say do you ever think that through in
38:03
your head I will pour out my spirit on
38:07
all flesh that means everybody on the
38:12
earth without permission I know what
38:17
that feels like begin to burn on the
38:20
inside of you too you think you're going
38:21
to explode then the flood of the life of
38:24
God comes in on top of that burning and
38:27
it actually comes out of the pores of
38:29
your body
38:30
it consumes your whole head it begins to
38:33
erase things on your soul the walls of
38:37
your soul he begins to bleach them white
38:40
from things that happen to you in the
38:42
past or maybe you even did in the past
38:45
it will be like you there's no way to
38:47
remember it because it's gone and people
38:51
when that begins to happen through
38:53
things will happen they'll either run to
38:55
God or run into the darkness and both of
39:01
those things will happen but a lot of
39:03
them will run after God they'll actually
39:04
drag people out of home he's an ass and
39:06
do you know who God is do you know him
39:07
do you know him on the street do you
39:09
know him do you know him do you know him
39:10
do you know him
39:11
I just felt him I need to know who he is
39:15
it'll be happening everywhere even in
39:20
churches your neighbors have been
39:27
watching you knowing how you live your
39:29
life maybe making fun of you or
39:31
harassing you or something they won't be
39:33
doing that when that happens they don't
39:36
pound your door down until you answer it
39:42
there's gonna be a hunger predators like
39:45
never before since this earth was made
39:47
to know the one who made them if you're
39:51
young you have a powerful life ahead of
39:54
you if you're not young ask to be
40:08
timeless because he's into restoring you
40:16
that means the way you look and the way
40:20
you feel
40:26
you have to declare you have to declare
40:29
it you have to declare it I know that
40:34
works the whole thing about whatever you
40:37
say your words if you don't waste your
40:41
words and a bunch of crazy stupid stuff
40:43
but you make them very focused you've
40:47
already learned one of the biggest
40:48
secrets in the Bible you should have
40:52
whatsoever you say he really means that
40:57
if it's not for something you know just
41:00
to spoil on yourself it's not just about
41:03
you now being timeless is not just a
41:05
view he wants you to be timeless how
41:08
will restore your youth how many people
41:12
have been saying that when I was young I
41:16
was smart when I was young I would read
41:19
stuff and then I actually believed it in
41:21
the Bible I literally believed it and so
41:25
I would act on it when I was young even
41:27
though it was quiet out to people I was
41:29
never quiet to God go in my room when I
41:33
had a moment to myself at a dorm room
41:35
with my four sisters at home I go out in
41:41
the yard at 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning
41:43
cuz nobody was out there but the frogs
41:45
lizards no alligators but a lot of other
41:49
creatures were in Florida you got at
41:51
night you're gonna find some don't worry
41:54
the alligators don't walk around like
41:55
dogs unless they've been trained to walk
42:00
on a leash then maybe people do crazy
42:03
stuff there I would just get along god I
42:05
would start saying to his word to him
42:07
your word says this okay
42:10
I'm not participating with the change in
42:12
my life when that thing comes it sounds
42:14
like a curse to me you know when women
42:16
go through the change I have seen women
42:20
in my life goes I said that sounds like
42:22
a curse I'm not I'm not under the curse
42:23
I was just clearing I will not
42:26
participate in any way whatsoever I'm
42:28
gonna wake up in the morning it'll be
42:29
done
42:33
so when I turned 55 I went to sleep when
42:38
I woke up I was done I didn't have one
42:42
symptom not one single symptom of
42:44
anything
42:46
I was not participating with it so if
42:50
you're young girls say it you don't have
42:55
to participate okay to me that looked
42:59
like a curse I wasn't going to have it I
43:01
believed it and I said it and I reminded
43:04
my god I've been born again I'm no
43:07
longer under the curse I received
43:09
nothing of the curse so I don't want age
43:12
I started adding age I don't want to
43:14
look old no matter how old I am I don't
43:17
want to look codon won't ever be old I
43:19
always want to be new every day and I'm
43:22
not just fitting in that and I think I
43:25
was like twelve when I said all that
43:30

43:34
my friends started having that I say I'm
43:37

43:47

43:54
flashes for me no other so I wasn't
43:56

God in there instead go back in a
46:15
different person in the past we didn't
46:18

46:19
can you just choose to do it amen be
46:23
free and stay free this is a powerful
46:28
time you have to understand you're a
46:30
supernatural being
46:33
[Applause]
46:35
[Music]
46:36
[Applause]
46:37
we represent heaven but have we been
46:41
living like it it's no wonder the world
46:45
doesn't want him we have not been very
46:49
good examples or witnesses have we and
46:53
it doesn't matter where you live those
46:56
people don't rule your life you still
47:00
make choices release the anointing into
47:06
every wall in your home in the floors
47:09
your family be walking on sit on the
47:12
furniture release the anointing then no
47:14
one ain't brakes top you live with that
47:19
it's in you first John 2:20 what is it
47:24
where's the horse Rick it's the first
47:27
John 2:27 yes yes when you become born
47:35
again you get a deposit of anointing and
47:38
it abides that means lives in you that
47:41
anointing the anointing that Christ
47:43
operated in that anointing that someone
47:46
touched the hem of his garment and
47:47
healed him the anointing that Peter and
47:49
Paul uses so much there was a cloud of
47:51
it around them you have it whatever you
47:56
put it on it won't ever wash off or wear
47:59
off go to your family home put it in the
48:02
refrigerator handle I bet everybody
48:03
touches that handle I do this we've had
48:10
testimony from people who actually
48:11
tested it in family members who were
48:15
angry for 20 years
48:17
got restored them because they had so
48:19
much in the anointing of John they touch
48:20
the refrigerator handle it would go up
48:24
in them the anointing breaks the yoke at
48:30
the workplace make sure you're using it
48:32
okay
48:34
I was still working in the world when I
48:36
found out about this and I would sit and
48:39
everybody's cheer after work in our
48:45
break room I touched every table they
48:49
didn't have cameras way back then they
48:51
didn't have the money to put canvases
48:52
that they didn't know I don't know what
48:54
they would have thought about me
48:57
everybody liked me in my job even the
48:59
sinners I work for attorneys had 80
49:02
attorneys that's a lot of people in that
49:04
building I had great favor with them
49:07
they would not swear around me they just
49:10
they wouldn't know what to say sometimes
49:12
because that was their normal length but
49:14
you know talking about languages that
49:16
was their normal language when I came
49:17
around I just didn't say anything they
49:18
just take their head and wave didn't
49:22
want to swear I would really see no we
49:26
had so many people get saved in that
49:28
company cuz the anointing was on
49:31
everything it was in the floors and the
49:34
walls I was gonna make sure I coated it
49:37
you don't ever run out your favorite
49:42
restaurant make sure you leave it in the
49:44
tables you know drop something and touch
49:47
the floor you can wash your hand later
49:49
because it literally comes out of you I
49:54
got a real creative eye I put it on the
49:56
wheels in my car and the anointing is
50:01
like fire if you can see it it looks
50:03
like fire so when I Drive fire tracks
50:06
everywhere I go people cross over them
50:08
they drive over them you know when he
50:10
goes up inside their car it gets on them
50:13
see you can be creative you give me do
50:16
covert operations till he throws you out
50:18
there you know I'm because the more you
50:21
use it the more powerful it becomes it
50:26
does something else it burns the demons
50:31
like you put a flame torch on you that's
50:35
what it does to them they don't like
50:38
that fire that's God's fire so how about
50:42
that run them out of your neighborhood
50:44
oh yeah Jen like Glen you see when you
50:52
see stuff there's residue left by other
50:54
people who are really looking they leave
50:57
a residue of the enemy and so we see
51:00
that when we go places before I sit down
51:01
anywhere now I will touch that seat and
51:04
I'll say I'll cleanse it for the kingdom
51:05
and then the fire of God does this and
51:10
removes it in hotel rooms
51:15
oh my hotel is in my favorite place you
51:19
know what I do it's 3:00 in the morning
51:20
I walk down the hall in touch every door
51:23
now I know they have cameras I don't
51:25
what they think but I'm not doing
51:26
anything harmful when I check in I let
51:28
them know I pray you may see me in the
51:31
hallways I'm just praying for a big
51:32
never oh well that's lovely thank you
51:35
for giving me permission
51:39
because I released it before I get in
51:40
the hotel I send the host to drive every
51:44
demon out of every hotel I'm not
51:47
tolerating him around me and I see them
51:49
running out okay I see the host going
51:52
there and literally running them out
51:54
then I released the life of God into the
51:57
hotel even into the whole place you know
52:00
how people sometimes don't treat you
52:01
nice we always get treated nice because
52:03
they're actually beginning to bask in
52:05
the anointing that's covering the entire
52:07
counter that they are touching as they
52:10
register me I do get upgrades I put it
52:17
in the planes I put it in every Airport
52:20
I'm not gonna waste my life just walking
52:23
around breathing everywhere you go you
52:26
can do something people said I like to
52:32
pierce a demon we release the anointing
52:34
you physically is a physical person
52:40
cannot attack a demon just in case you
52:42
ever wondered there are spiritual beings
52:45
but you have spiritual weapons in you
52:48
there can be leashed upon them I'll go
52:54
by places that I know you know places of
52:56
ill repute that's the nicest way to say
52:58
it I will send the anointing in there
53:00
like fire and I can see through the
53:03
walls I see the demons streaming as it
53:05
hits them they begin to scream and ride
53:09
then they're burning in this fire from
53:11
God the place gets extremely boring
53:15
because there's nothing in there to and
53:17
you know empower sin or whatever's going
53:20
on my one sister not Jen I say that I
53:24
have a sister who was kidnapped and
53:27
dragged away when she was young we
53:29
prayed her we finally got her back years
53:31
later and and she didn't trust anybody
53:34
but but right now limite she's a
53:35
firehouse she is on fire for God she is
53:37
she is so destroying places of darkness
53:41
you know that demonic and everything
53:43
she's also a seer and in her life
53:45
there's time in her life but she would
53:47
dance in clubs and she knew every time I
53:50
drove by
53:53
seriously would tell me this she said
53:57
you know I know you drove by earlier
53:59
today didn't you why yes I did she said
54:02
the men fell asleep on the counters
54:04
[Laughter]
54:09
and she would stand there dancing and
54:13
she look at the paper we may as well go
54:15
home my sister just override she's
54:20
released to fire God in here and every
54:22
demon is left my family's very real
54:26
wasn't so God did something even better
54:34
than at a time when we didn't have a
54:36
place he moved me in with her her places
54:38
one of the place that I slept on the
54:40
floor there was so much anointing you
54:43
would float in it when he came in the
54:45
door and she finally came in one day
54:48
literally threw her stuff her bags and
54:51
I'm giving up I cannot do this anymore
54:57
I come home there's anointing I'm gonna
55:02
work you've release the anointing it's
55:04
in the clothes I'm wearing it's in my
55:07
closet it's in my bag I'm carrying I'm
55:12
just gonna have to leave and she quit so
55:22
if God has moved you in family there is
55:24
a reason please release it so no one can
55:29
tell me this doesn't work you can't tell
55:31
me it's too late she would literally
55:34
call me this place is dead
55:41
and we actually did shut a place down
55:43
literally it was one of the biggest
55:47
clubs and I kept declaring that it would
55:51
be taken to the ground there wouldn't be
55:53
a brick left because it sucked up the
55:55
lives of young girls who my sister would
55:59
win to the Lord while she was in that
56:01
club and she told me you don't have to
56:04
live like this I know Jesus Christ is
56:07
this crazy she's running from him but
56:09
she said I know I can help you
56:11
you can quit God can give you a life I
56:13
know you have children I know you hate
56:15
this they usually do most all of them
56:17
heat it and she says so I'm gonna go
56:20
pray with you back here i'ma lay hands
56:21
on Jesus crazy she said I know I still
56:24
have anointing it's been really dormant
56:25
but I'm gonna pray for you to receive
56:27
Jesus Christ and if you do this I will
56:29
promise you she'll find a better job and
56:32
every single time it worked for her
56:33
every time these girls want to be
56:36
mentored by her but she wasn't even
56:38
serving god
56:39
she said no I'll show you a place you
56:41
can go and go and get fed spiritually
56:43
and she said I know one day I'll have to
56:46
give up what God finally got tired of
56:47
waiting on him so he moved me in
56:54
the anointing breaks the yoke and you
57:01
can't deny you have it there is a
57:04
scripture that talks about it and if I
57:08
say these words the anointing does what
57:10
everyone in the room knows it breaks the
57:13
yoke well that's the anointing that's in
57:16
first John 2:27 did you get a deposit
57:19
off when you received Christ how long
57:21
ago was that it's been sitting in you
57:26
waiting for you to let it out
57:30
the more you let it out it will come
57:33
outside your whole being it can't even
57:35
be contained inside it will be outside
57:38
you and sometimes listen to this if I
57:45
want you I could fill the whole room
57:46
with mine cuz so many years every day of
57:51
my life I loose it I feel it leaving me
57:57
when that woman touched the hem of His
57:59
garment in me to demand on that what did
58:02
Christ say he felt it leaving him that
58:12
was power that was the anointing that
58:15
totally healed that woman totally after
58:18
years it races people from the dead it
58:22
drives demons out of people it heals
58:24
people in this world because in that
58:27
world that's how they used it in this
58:28
world think send it over the internet
58:32
through every single phone call it will
58:36
go and if you don't do it guess what
58:39
it's not gonna happen just do it it's in
58:43
the Bible it was used in the Bible it
58:46
didn't go away God's never changed that
58:49
I teach children to do it so by the time
58:54
they're 30 they could probably feel like
58:58
a whole city block if not more by your
59:02
presence someday someone will walk
59:06
through a hospital when every person has
59:08
healed because you're walking down the
59:10
hall not even touching them it will be
59:13
the anointing that you carry every
59:19
missionary team should be training their
59:20
people wherever they go to release the
59:22
anointing okay there you go there's
59:29
where that there's that that's the
59:31
anointing the anointing you haven't
59:34
deposited up it's a deposit because when
59:36
you put it out you get more the more you
59:39
give out the more deposits the more you
59:42
never stop never stop I get mine I get I
59:44
get refilled all day long every single
59:46
day I get more and I release it in the
59:48
entire buildings I don't want the enemy
59:51
bad I wasn't born to live with him and
60:00
I'm never tolerating him in my presence
60:03
if you remember the bodies of the Christ
60:06
lived like this what would this world
60:10
look like by one simple thing not even
60:14
all the rest it's available just by one
60:17
little simple thing yes you could prove
60:21
as in the Word of God they're scripture
60:25
to back it up you have to be willing
60:27
well you have to even know first because
60:31
this is not always taught in church
60:35
every new Christian should be taught
60:38
about the anointing every single one
60:40
should know you are powerful you are
60:42
dangerous you have weapons against hell
60:43
built-in you put in you from the day you
60:46
receive Jesus Christ and no one can say
60:52
I don't want that they don't even have
60:55
to know you've used it it is a secret
61:00
weapon unless people need it and then
61:05
they come and ask when you lay hands on
61:07
them always always always release the
61:10
anointing always every time you shake a
61:13
hand say in your spirit every DS it's a
61:17
spiritual weapon
61:19
come here come up here I'm gonna show
61:21
you when you meet somebody somebody goes
61:24
you go I'm gonna say it out loud bits
61:25
with you and she says hi and ago hi how
61:29
are you doing the whole time I can feel
61:31
it going on in my arm into her arm so
61:34
you don't even have to tell people use
61:40
the anointing people if you don't even
61:45
want to know the the deeper higher stuff
61:50
that maybe boggles your mind sometimes
61:54
if you were in heaven some of the stuff
61:57
you saw would do that to your head if
61:59
you saw some of the army of heaven you'd
62:01
really you probably fall under chairs
62:05
they're fierce they have Spears coming
62:09
out of the entire body they go into the
62:12
camp an enemy and they spin and shred
62:15
their name is shredder they're my
62:20
friends in heaven you will have angels
62:25
as friends it won't be weird they've
62:29
always been there they've always been
62:30
made by God having a friend is not
62:33
worshiping they have assignments they're
62:36
very focused on their assignment on this
62:38
earth at this time because evil is still
62:40
here what did you think they were gonna
62:42
do one day what are they gonna do
62:46
sticking a little group somewhere in a
62:48
cloud when the devil's not here
62:52
seriously think about things like that
62:54
in your head sometimes they have
62:57
personalities they're exciting they like
62:59
things they have things they like that
63:00
things they don't like they have
63:02
opinions about you
63:07
now if they're your guardian angel they
63:09
always think you're perfect and amazing
63:14
they sometimes get frustrated they go
63:19
home for R&R that's why you need more
63:23
than one and we laugh but this is truth
63:28
[Music]
63:31
here our supernatural being carrying
63:35
their light of God and the glory is
63:37
wrapped around you and you're living
63:39
with humans they have conversations
63:46
we're gonna have a sitcom one day about
63:49
guardian angels it will be a comedy and
63:57
God is perfectly okay with that
64:02
sometimes it is comic comical for them
64:05
but when you do something when you do
64:10
something that is against the enemy when
64:13
you stand up for what is right they get
64:17
ecstatic they will yell they will run
64:21
you know that whole thing about getting
64:22
inside you running around the house
64:23
while when you're by yourself they do
64:26
that because they've been waiting yeah
64:34
[Applause]
64:36
in those two running oh god did you see
64:40
that did you hear what they said
64:46
[Applause]
64:49
they've been with you like forever when
64:55
day you'll ride the rush in heaven with
64:56
them that's a rollercoaster so yes they
65:03
will have kind of new lives at one point
65:05
because there's no more evil you know
65:08
especially the host
65:09
I think Gabriel's group is more probable
65:11
used to just connecting and giving
65:13
messages and stuff but the hosts all
65:15
they do is fight they fight the war they
65:17
fight the war they fight the war they
65:19
fight the war they fight their war they
65:20
fight their war they fight they war
65:21
that's what they do so one day they
65:24
won't have that they're gonna have fun
65:28
that's what they're gonna do they'll
65:36
probably escort us to new planets to
65:39
explore new planets so good to do
65:43
exciting things what they'll do and
65:46
we'll know them right now we need to
65:50
know God right that's what they want us
65:52
to do but one day their life will be
65:54
different and I know we're down here
65:57
most people in like natural people not
66:00
were the understanding how things
66:01
operate they God made them now he made
66:04
them first but we existed before they
66:06
did
66:07
I love these revelations before he made
66:12
the angels we existed in God that thing
66:18
about him being from the beginning to
66:20
the end and the beginning you were in
66:22
him you saw all that 90 verse 1 through
66:29
2 you were with him so he made this
66:40
statement to me one day because I talked
66:42
a lot about the angels because I know a
66:43
lot about them and God said yes they've
66:46
been with me for a long time I made them
66:49
a very long time ago in tribes they're
66:51
all made in tribes the army Gabriel's
66:54
Lucifer heads and ones he was over so
66:59
they're not there anymore
67:00
but there's still some that do worship
67:03
the Seraphim they still have some that
67:06
sing in heaven but we actually replace
67:08
all the worship angels that's why we
67:11
worship that's why they don't want you
67:12
to worship the ones the fallen ones they
67:15
were worship angels who literally would
67:18
go before the throne of God and worship
67:19
Him and they chose the one who was their
67:22
leader who was accreted being over him
67:25
that's why they cannot repent like they
67:28
can't repent amen but we existed we
67:32
always were in him we didn't just appear
67:34
it's not all of a sudden guy said I want
67:36
to make billions of little spiritual
67:37
beings and one day I'll send to the
67:40
earth they were always we were always in
67:41
him when there was just Melchizedek and
67:45
the living creatures and the word and
67:49
the Holy Spirit before he started making
67:51
stuff we were there living in and out
67:56
riding on the rainbow that's where you
67:59
were everyone who ever existed it came
68:02
from him eternity is in him that's why
68:04
he can take you anywhere that's your dad
68:09

68:11
gonna declare something stuff in them
68:18

72:05
think that when you go home to heaven
72:06

72:09
that's because he's got and you are his
72:12
child and he does purpose that Jesus
72:17
said father you and me and me and you I
72:19
pray that they will be one even as we
72:21

72:24
you come home to heaven you will step
72:26
inside the Father Christ will step
72:28
inside the Father Holy Spirit will step
72:30
inside the Father and that is one we
72:34
won't be the three and want to be the
72:35

73:10
remind them Holy Spirit to release the
73:13
anointing all the time they can do
73:17
damage to hell's plans and break yokes
73:20
off of people because they carry the
73:23
anointing that your son not just anybody

73:40
they get a stone of fire put in their
73:43
spirit man that brings in light and the
73:46
more they obey and the more they love
73:49
that light will become so brilliant they
73:52
will look like an inferno one day thank
73:55
you God for truth and life to be and
73:57
everybody here and if they're not

00:01
welcome everyone I'm excited about this

00:18
not here last night
00:19

00:23
amen how many people this is the first
00:27
time you've heard me speak how many have
00:32
heard me on YouTube but not in person
00:34
how many people never heard me speak
00:37
before thank you Jesus
00:39
help them all I was never made to be
00:45
normal I'm one of 15 I'm number three
00:51
that means that was a mother at a Jay
00:55
stop as a helper if you never were part
00:59
of a big family a tribe you don't
01:00
understand that if you were you know
01:02
exactly what I'm talking about
01:03
you pretty much never had a life that
01:08
was your life you learned at a young age
01:10
to surrender you learned how to be in
01:12
charge you know how to to break up
01:17
fights to bring peace be adventurous and
01:22
exciting with the things you have them
01:24
do to keep them busy so they weren't
01:26
fighting how to feed that many people
01:30
how to make that much food i watch that
01:32
many dishes 150 every day peel 50 pounds
01:38
of potato once a week eight loads of
01:42
laundry a day I think we did like 60 a
01:44
week I helped with all of it
01:48
and so I learned at early age to hear
01:51
God for help my baby sister sitting on
01:56
the front row is number 15
01:59
I was like a second mom to her so we
02:06
grew up knowing each other really well
02:08
she lives with me has lived with me
02:10
since 1999 and so has my mom because my
02:14
dad decided to go home to heaven he's
02:17
having a wonderful time up there on his
02:19
ranch with all of our pets it's too late
02:23
to tell me they don't go there
02:25
it's the father's choice man there's
02:29
some things only he decides and if he
02:32
decides to do who's gonna argue it's too
02:34
late they're there I recognize many of
02:39
my pets I had him when I was like 7
02:42
you know much before that not a lot but
02:44
ever since that time although all the
02:46
pets I've ever had I've recognized all
02:48
of them and many of my siblings pets
02:50
they had our brother Joey's duck named
02:52
Max when he was 9 my brother's alligator
02:56
named Charlie that lived in our bathtub
02:58
until it was bath time my brother's
03:03
iguana lizard named Iggy they've done to
03:05
the downstairs closet which was also our
03:07
phone booth you know in the 50s and 60s
03:10
you had one phone with one line and it
03:12
was hooked to the wall and sometimes it
03:17
was a party line that doesn't mean it
03:18
was a party means you shared everybody's
03:21
conversation with whoever they were
03:23
talking to you until they were done
03:25
unless you could convince them you
03:27
really needed the phone so I grew up in
03:31
the time in the era before microwaves at
03:34
the very beginning of television when
03:35
you had a round screen it was black and
03:37
white and had five shows not a lot to
03:42
watch right we had a big old house we
03:46
had a big yard and all of our friends
03:49
wanted to come and visit us so that
03:51
means we had probably had 30 around 30
03:53
all the time in our yard and so we
03:56
learned how to get along with the rest
03:57
of the world just because we had to grow
04:00
up together
04:01
and my father knew God well the father
04:06
and the son in the Holy Spirit very well
04:08
so did his mother some seventh
04:10
generation of knowing
04:13
odd living for him loving for him and I
04:17
love everyone no matter the mistakes you
04:20
make even what you believe I know where
04:24
you came from you came from him he had
04:28
plans for everyone not everyone chose
04:30
his plans many people don't even know
04:33
him but he wants to know them so I have
04:37
a lot of Grace and I have unending
04:41
patience long-suffering and patience in
04:45
my life so I can put up with just about
04:47
anything all the time and God needed me
04:50
to be that way if I was going to share
04:52
his home to people all over the world no
04:57
matter what I would have thought about
04:58
them I changed I changed several times
05:02
in my life I got more and more like God
05:04
because there was supposed to be just
05:06
like him
05:07
I actually began to say that there was
05:09
nothing else to do except say it so I
05:11
used to stand and say God I want to be
05:13
just like you
05:15
now if you loved your father would you
05:18
say that about him
05:20
my brothers used to say that about my
05:22
earthly father I'm gonna be just like
05:24
you dad I said that about my Heavenly
05:26
Father I wanna be just like you I'm
05:30
gonna talk like you I want to act like
05:32
you want people to see you when they see
05:34
me I want them to hear you when they
05:36
hear me and I want to crush darkness and
05:46
so one day I was just minding my own
05:50
business which is God's business I was
05:53
speaking in a church I also speak in
05:55
many other places anyone who wants to
05:57
hear about heaven Ellen bite me they
05:59
have to get past the pink hair whoever
06:02
knew that that would be a stumbling
06:03
block right I've been the same and the
06:07
same as far as my relationship with God
06:09
since I was age 4 that's a very long
06:12
time 62 years I've known Jesus Christ
06:16
personally and so you know I knew he was
06:20
watching my life all the time I mean he
06:22
does live in us right he's not blind
06:26
but he still loves us he has hope for us
06:28
and he has a lot of hope for us because
06:31
Christ in us is the hope of so if he
06:35
lives in you you're not going to escape
06:37
carrying it and that means one day
06:40
you'll shine like the stars in the
06:42
heavens because the word says so so
06:46
before the one day I was going to tell
06:48
you about there was another time I was
06:49
in another city and I think we're out in
06:52
fairgrounds or something I don't
06:53
remember we had to go to ladies room
06:55
there were no lights all the lights had
06:57
blown out and that was a problem so I
07:00
went in there to see what was going on
07:02
when I walked in the door it was this
07:04
long big room and it was dark until I
07:07
opened the door and then it was light so
07:11
I started looking for the light I'm
07:13
literally looking where's the light
07:15
coming from I'm not kidding about any of
07:17
this and where's the light coming from
07:19
none of the lights are on but everywhere
07:21
I looked there was light until I looked
07:24
in the mirror it was coming from me I
07:31
was stunned but it was it was it was
07:36
overwhelming to me that I was seeing the
07:39
word alive in me but when you begin to
07:42
declare things about God or for God
07:45
those things are gonna start happening
07:46
in your life and I would tell people all
07:48
the time one day you shine like the
07:49
stars in the heavens because he does let
07:53
me tell you he shines I'm done my Jesus
07:56
Christ he's got so much glory coming
07:57
from you he can dim that glory if he
08:00
wants to but I've seen him full-out
08:02
glory like a million diamonds and I used
08:05
to be so undone whenever I would see him
08:08
and so I'm a little steam is still
08:10
staying in the ladies bathroom when
08:11
there's no light anywhere except coming
08:13
from me and what this is crazy so I
08:16
still thought well I know I can see it
08:18
in the mirror but let's look at all the
08:19
stalls so I opened every dough every
08:21
door and there was darkness till I went
08:23
in then it was light and I walked up and
08:26
down then it was fun I went up and down
08:28
everywhere in there and it was light
08:31
everywhere and I thought if somebody
08:32
needs to come in here now why the lights
08:37
by the lights shining right now you can
08:40
see whatever you need to do and so these
08:44
were just like I would call them random
08:47
encounters or instances that happened to
08:49
me most of my life but that was one that
08:52
really surprised even me and I heard the
08:56
Lord say did I not say you would shine
09:00
like the stars in the heavens that even
09:02
the night would be light round about you
09:06
and he was just saying the word to me
09:09
and he was confirming the word and so if
09:12
you're faithful to him he's gonna be
09:14
faithful to you and I know everyone's
09:16
been through hard times or they have
09:18
issues in their life or things that
09:20
they're facing that might not be easy
09:22
remember who he is and remember who you
09:26
are okay if you begin to remember who
09:31
you are according to the word you change
09:34
the way you look at everything and
09:37
sometimes nothing seems impossible I've
09:41
been in a lot of impossible places in my
09:45
life and it never touched me I made a
09:48
decision I'm not changing according to
09:51
circumstances or what people think of
09:52
what people say oh it is actually
09:54
happening I don't know what any of it
09:56
affects me because my hope is in him
09:59
my eternity is in him no man holds my
10:04
eternity in their hands it's in his
10:08
hands and I told people one time when we
10:11
had absolutely nothing and slept on
10:13
people's floors that wasn't to teach us
10:15
something that was to show other
10:18
something that no matter where you are
10:21
you can carry the glory you can shift
10:23
things change things by the decisions
10:25
you make and the choices you make every
10:27
day of your life it doesn't stop you
10:30
from ruling and reigning from Christ it
10:32
doesn't take away your authority and I
10:35
told somebody one time they're saying
10:36
well how are you holding up I want what
10:38
I'm up what am i holding up what are you
10:41
talking about well you know all the
10:43
things you're going through and I'm not
10:44
going to do anything I'm living my life
10:48
for Christ's no matter what's going on I
10:51
will move things I will not let things
10:53
move me now I begin to declare the
10:58
goodness of God over my life over my
11:00
family's life because I knew this was a
11:03
very short thing in my life I knew it
11:05
wasn't the devil how about that one it
11:09
was God showing people that you can live
11:12
powerfully no matter what's going on
11:14
around you about the decisions you
11:16
choose it can change things I didn't
11:21
change anything I did about my church I
11:23
still served I helped what I had I would
11:26
give I love people anyway I was
11:29
rejoicing every day of my life I chose
11:31
to be happy and we were saying with the
11:35
front sweeping on their floors and it
11:38
was my daughter's a fifth birthday and
11:40
you know what she was happy about
11:41
anything could because she had lived for
11:44
the hottest we trained our children to
11:47
know God Himself to know who he is what
11:49
his plans are for us and she just all
11:52
she wanted was a little baby doll
11:53
carriage and a baby doll and we couldn't
11:56
get any of that at the time because
11:57
things had but something had been taken
11:59
from us it wasn't us doing it we didn't
12:01
even curse the person and so there was a
12:04
sound outside the front door she was
12:07
awake she ran to the front door and
12:09
outside was a brand-new with a big bow
12:14
on it the most beautiful baby doll cares
12:17
I've seen in my life and the most
12:19
beautiful baby I've seen full of
12:22
accessories in this beautiful carriage
12:24
from someone who knew nothing about what
12:26
was going on and she ran out saying look
12:30
my present has arrived the Angels
12:34
brought us and and so we celebrated her
12:40
birthday it was awesome the next year
12:43
before the next year ended someone
12:46
walked up doesn't said here take this
12:48
and live here free for a year it was a
12:51
million dollar condo out at one of the
12:53
most exclusive places in our city at the
12:56
beach
12:57
[Music]
12:59
we didn't call this person we didn't
13:01
tell them anything we lived the same way
13:05
every day if we don't even living in
13:08
that place because we trusted God we
13:14
knew he held our future in his hands and
13:17
I refused to let the enemy have any fun
13:19
no I tormented him the entire time
13:23
because all I ever did was have a good
13:25
report I had a god report of what God
13:28
was saying about us amen
13:30
so no matter what it looks like start
13:32
worshiping him declaring who he is who
13:35
holds your future in his hand amen
13:39
because we're entering into powerful
13:41
times on this earth I've been talking
13:43
about this for a while but things are
13:45
literally starting to happen that I said
13:49
even 12 years ago literally happening
13:51
exactly the way God told me they would
13:53
happen and I'm here especially to do two
13:57
things I'm gonna talk about Trump I hope
14:00
you like him I hope you realize God does
14:08
not always choose the one we think is
14:10
better he chooses the one who is the
14:13
best for what he needs even my own mom
14:19
and she was here she came up and give
14:20
her a test my mom is a hoot she's a be
14:24
something I forget how old she is all
14:25
the time she calls people who are 69 old
14:29
but she never includes herself she
14:33
travels all over the world with me on no
14:35
medication she has no help to do
14:37
anything she's planning to live to be
14:39
120 unless God once or longer she'd like
14:44
to see my dad before them but she
14:45
understands he's having a good time so
14:47
she's okay with that but she's very
14:51
political and has been most of her life
14:55
because she knows what is right and what
14:58
is wrong and she has a plumb switch to
15:00
prove it
15:05
if you'd ever watch any my when I
15:08
campaigned this whole last term before
15:11
Trump was elected I had a lot of Trump
15:14
reports and my mom wanted to be in as
15:15
many she could on my facebook
15:17
she gave her own thoughts and opinions
15:19
on everything most of the time she had
15:22
her plumb switch with her people said we
15:26
need your mom my mom did speak her mind
15:28
but it was along the lines of what God
15:31
believed and purpose she knew what life
15:34
was she knew what death was she didn't
15:36
have a problem discerning them or
15:38
telling anyone which one to choose she
15:42
hasn't changed and she's still my mom
15:45
even though I'm in my 60s Jen's in her
15:47
40s our mom is still our mom and I can
15:53
probably hear her when she goes to
15:55
heaven one day giving me her opinions on
15:57
things she loves this place she loves
16:04
Pastor Dave and Dee Dee so much she's
16:09
getting ready for her next month when we
16:11
go on our british isles cruise she's
16:13
going to get to for the very first time
16:15
visit the land of her earthly ancestors
16:18
which is the irish she's a good example
16:23
of an irish look I'll tell you why and
16:27
she's expecting to have a lot of fun
16:30
amen so she's getting on her treadmill
16:34
getting in shape picking out her she
16:37
already got her suitcase packed I think
16:41
and so she has a lot of fun when she go
16:44
she will meet a hundred new people who
16:46
haul them all her friends so she still
16:49
enjoys her life she starts her own
16:53
prayer line yeah if people want children
16:56
if they if they're in a place where they
16:58
can have babies gate not saying if you
17:00
can have or not I'm saying if you want
17:02
them and you're married you're gonna
17:03
have one if she prays for you we have
17:06
had other evidence of here right here in
17:08
this church she pray for them I think it
17:11
was like nine months later their
17:14
daughter had a baby
17:16
and so my mom is serious that she'll
17:19
start a prayer line at meetings who
17:20
would like to have babies you must be
17:23
married because that is coming first and
17:33
she'll pray for him in every one of them
17:34
as far as we know every one of them has
17:35
had a baby that she prayed for him I
17:37
mean she will she'll make sure you
17:40
understand what it means to have one cuz
17:41
if anybody knows it would be her what's
17:44
gonna happen as the baby gets older this
17:46
is what you can expect don't be shocked
17:49
when this happens or this happens it's
17:51
all gonna be okay all this stuff is
17:53
normal you just give your life away for
17:56
about ten years and so she's a lot of
18:02
fun but my mom put a lot on me my dad
18:05
put a tremendous amount my mom put a lot
18:08
of the practical logical things that we
18:11
need to know how to treat people how to
18:13
be polite how to be a young lady cuz you
18:17
never know who you're gonna make sure
18:19
you always have clean underwear that was
18:23
always on the list every single day I
18:28
always do what Jen always wear your seat
18:32
belt or if you're in the car with her
18:34
she will put it on you herself and so
18:37
she does not want people to break the
18:39
law and she reminds us of it 24 hours a
18:41
day even if we're not even in other
18:44
countries I'm down you she's really on
18:47
top of things so she's a lot of fun my
18:49
dad was the most amazing person I knew
18:52
on the earth and I love to talk about
18:55
him but tonight he wants me to talk
18:57
about Trump in heaven they're rooting
19:01
for him I don't know what earth people
19:03
think about heaven knows that God picked
19:05
him and what he's already done for this
19:07
country proves that God picked him amen
19:11
and he's going to win in 2020 in case
19:16
you wonder write it down write it down
19:19
it's going to have
19:21
and he's only through like two years and
19:25
he's already created five million jobs
19:26
if you didn't know I know all the stats
19:30
I have friends who are part of the Trump
19:33
administration um I don't know him yet
19:36
but I will God said I would and I'm you
19:38
know when whenever that happens is good
19:40
with me but he's got a lot of things
19:42
planned he hasn't even talked about yet
19:44
I'm talking about the president I did
19:46
just come from the Trump 2020
19:50
announcement rally in Orlando Florida
19:55
it was so deafening you could hardly
19:58
hear anything from the people they had a
20:01
hundred thousand tickets but the place
20:02
only held 20-some thousand people so
20:04
everybody else was outside they had
20:07
Jumbotron set up and this is the honest
20:10
truth no matter what you've heard on the
20:11
news there were 35 hecklers
20:16
thirty-five against to the tens of
20:20
thousands which which came to cheer him
20:24
on and thank him for what he has done
20:26
and the thing about the hecklers because
20:30
I made sure I was outside most of the
20:31
time on purpose this time I was over
20:33
there by them releasing the anointing
20:35
into every one of them they needed help
20:41
if I was going to be one of them I would
20:44
have set up my stand I would have given
20:45
our plan I literally would have said
20:48
this is our plan for the Democratic
20:50
Party this is what we got planned it's
20:51
going to be great they didn't do that
20:52
all they could do was swear at Trump and
20:54
swear it people it was really sad so I
20:58
was praying all the time releasing the
21:00
anointing sending the host upholding on
21:01
the demonic off of them I mean I was
21:03
over here having a prayer warrior time
21:06
they couldn't scream over the sound of
21:10
the the jumbo screens they couldn't
21:14
because I was on the corner like right
21:16
here's the massive Amway Center that was
21:19
deafening was like a wave would come
21:20
from here from the jumbotron that wave
21:23
would come from here and I was being hit
21:24
by both waves and I didn't want to make
21:28
some statements because I'm a seer that
21:30
means I see the spirit or I'm not like I
21:32
see everybody's angels here everybody
21:34
say Thank You angel for putting up with
21:37
me loving me and watching over me making
21:46
work as much well I have to tell you
21:51
what exciting points of me being there
21:53
and I literally just came from Hollywood
21:56
from being there for seven days night
21:58
and day I'm gonna be part of giving
22:01
content I was sharing this last night I
22:02
literally um what I said seven years ago
22:06
what God has said to me I said it
22:08
happened this last week in Hollywood
22:11
they're starting up my contract to give
22:14
spiritual realm content for the
22:16
resurrection of Jesus Christ movie
22:18
that's being made in Hollywood
22:23
in Hollywood so you're gonna see the
22:27
truth
22:27
on the screen to the entire movie like
22:35
Colossians where Christ spoiled and
22:38
messed up the principalities and powers
22:41
in the midst of hell ruined their very
22:44
village forever stripped all the royal
22:46
robes off of Satan and took the
22:48
gemstones everyone that God put on him
22:51
according to Ezekiel 28 you will see him
22:53
pluck them off one at a time in the
22:56
movie leaving only the mountings that
22:58
held them you'll see him take the keys
23:01
of hell death in the grave
23:03
why the rush to the all of the hell that
23:05
was present to watch this show it was a
23:07
show clearly the word said Christ made a
23:11
show of it openly so he had a show in
23:15
hell
23:16
wasting hell in front of all of Hell
23:19
okay and you will see that in every
23:22
detail I can't tell you much more than
23:25
that but I promise you you will see that
23:26
in detail while people send up all of a
23:29
theater and scream for Jesus Christ
23:34
you'll see the depths of Hell where it
23:37
took place and the Bible says all
23:39
through the Bible as Jonah was in the
23:41
belly of the whale for three days so
23:42
we'll be in the earth God had a plan no
23:48
matter what anyone thought he had a plan
23:50
when he sent his son and on the day he
23:54
died which is actually in the garden
23:55
when he drank the cup you will also see
23:57
what he drank it won't be a thought in
24:02
your mind anymore because he died in the
24:04
garden he died to his own will he said
24:07
so if it's possible father take this cup
24:11
from me because he saw what he knew what
24:13
was in that cup evil the most worst evil
24:16
ever into his perfectly pure body
24:19
walking as a man righteous righteous
24:22
righteous with no sin asked to take that
24:25
that is what had to be nailed to the
24:28
cross not just his body that had to go
24:33
in this perfect body
24:35
every sin that could be committed had to
24:37
be nailed to the cross he is the only
24:39
one who can forgive because he's the
24:41
only one that drank that cup no one took
24:44
that inside of themselves and but was
24:46
nailed to the cross it was what was in
24:48
him that he had to drink in that garden
24:52
it was God's will and he couldn't even
24:55
look upon his son he couldn't hear his
24:59
father for that time he sets them on the
25:02
cross so this would be the most
25:04
different movie you'll ever see in your
25:06
life it will introduce the spirit realm
25:08
to all of Hollywood in the whole world
25:11
[Applause]
25:15
so yes I am excited because God is
25:20
taking Hollywood amen you'll see many
25:27
changes in some of the worst places in
25:29
our country here because God has always
25:32
planned to have them for himself Satan
25:34
has been ruling in these places for a
25:36
long time so he's very much afraid I
25:41
will not use the word angry there's a
25:45
difference in angry and terrified he
25:48
Satan is terrified he can't stop it cuz
25:54
Godin has somebody who's never gonna say
25:57
no who is not afraid of what the enemy
25:59
might do the enemy is afraid of what I
26:03
might do does the word say that if you
26:08
submit yourself under the hand of God
26:10
you know resisters I mean oh no I'm not
26:13
taking you I will not tolerate anything
26:18
you're offering me I'm gonna serve you I
26:22
serve the Most High God of heaven earth
26:24
I just polish you I'll never surrender
26:26
you don't waste your time get out
26:32
[Applause]
26:35
well that is how we're supposed to live
26:41
that as a manifested daughter of God
26:45
manifesting his power his plans his love
26:49
his ways his will by the way they live
26:56
it's not something you do every now and
26:58
then it is a lifestyle and they're
27:02
people and God made me take years to get
27:06
to this point so people would know who I
27:08
am and what I stand for and even how I
27:10
live it would be hard for someone to try
27:15
to bash me because most people wouldn't
27:17
believe it someone sees me the first
27:20
time I don't believe you I think you
27:20
lied about everything why don't you go
27:22
ask God you cannot hear him because you
27:26
should if you belong to him the word
27:29
says you not hear the voice of another
27:32
if you want truth go ask him and pursue
27:36
him until you hear it do you give up in
27:41
two weeks
27:42
how can you give you something that's
27:44
gonna take 50 years because some things
27:50
I've been waiting 50 years for and I
27:53
will still get it because I'm not giving
27:56
up and I'm not gonna step back I'll have
28:02
whatever he wants to give me and you
28:06
should be saying the same thing so
28:10
Hollywood is going to be wrecked by the
28:14
Most High God by the hosts of heaven
28:17
I've been bombarding Hollywood since I
28:19
left they're sending in sweeps of that
28:22
place ten billion hosts of heaven to
28:27
pull down every stronghold of Satan
28:29
every realm any high level being has
28:32
been ruling from there being shredded
28:38
the ones that can't will have their
28:40
mouth shut while I'm there because I
28:44
don't have to tolerate them God didn't
28:49
did he his son didn't did he
28:54
are we supposed to be just like them we
28:58
made in their image and after their
29:00
likeness which means the way they
29:02
operate were supposed to operate so when
29:05
the body finally gets that message and
29:07
they wake up stand up and stand out
29:09
you'll see many powerful changes and
29:13
shifts happens in this world there are
29:18
10 year-olds right now commanding an
29:20
army of the hosts of heaven and they've
29:23
been doing it for three years they wreak
29:27
havoc on hell the enemy runs from them
29:33
this is who we are we're not weak little
29:39
humans we may live in this world but you
29:44
are not you are an alien you're from
29:47
another world and God is serious about
29:53
us living on earth as they live in
29:54
heaven so this time for America is a
29:59
great time it will set things up for
30:02
many years to come
30:03
24 years of God in the White House will
30:06
happen
30:08
[Music]
30:10
[Applause]
30:12
so you can expect Trump to win in 2020
30:16
and then pence win for the next eight
30:17
years after that
30:19
and whoever pence picks his
30:22
vice-president will be president for
30:23
eight years eight years after that
30:27
twenty four years in the White House
30:29
maybe the Democrats should take a long
30:31
vacation and wait it out I'm trying to
30:40
help them it is sound advice you can
30:50
only talk like this if you've seen God
30:51
face to face and he told you that except
30:54
he doesn't just tell me he shows me when
30:58
Trump said he was winning God showed me
31:00
took me in Fisher and showed me
31:01
Trump sitting in the White House when
31:04
there's still 17 people in the
31:05
Republican group running against him God
31:08
said I will eliminate them one by one
31:11
they'll be forced to take him because
31:15
even the leaders didn't want him because
31:19
they couldn't control him they couldn't
31:21
scare him they couldn't buy him God
31:27
picked the right person so I know I
31:33
don't know who Pence is going to pick
31:35
but they will seriously consider it
31:38
they've already heard me declare all
31:40
this on the inaugural prayer breakfast
31:44
when they let me do the prayer or Trump
31:48
and pence I prophesied so I'm looking
31:56
forward to these years in my life don't
31:58
miss them don't sit on a rock somewhere
32:02
and just watch it go by be a part of it
32:07
because once you step out and start
32:09
doing something it just accelerates your
32:13
faith explodes when you begin to see God
32:16
do things quickly because we're in a
32:18
time of acceleration it will be quickly
32:21
we still have years left I don't always
32:24
tell how many years left I don't know
32:26
the date in time I know the event like
32:31
at one point there'll be I'm talking
32:33
about when there's no more time on the
32:34
earth I'm not talking about just the
32:38
millennial reign time not past that
32:40
because it's during them alone and ring
32:42
you know that's a thousand years right
32:44
how many people know that been to Israel
32:48
been to the temple I know that Christ
32:52
will sit on a throne for 1,000 years in
32:57
that place when no one is destroying
32:59
Israel if you've wondered about that
33:01
don't be concerned about it keep praying
33:03
for them God is blessing them the desert
33:06
is blooming like it never has before I
33:08
was there five years ago it was all
33:10
desert when I came this time because I
33:12
was also there for like I forgot how
33:14
many days it seemed like eternity I
33:17
didn't get to speak in a nice hotel I
33:19
actually had viewed the pilgrim his tour
33:21
where you went to Masada and every place
33:24
Jesus went then other you know Elijah
33:26
you know I'm not Carmel I was there I
33:29
was in the garden tomb where the two
33:31
angels who rolled the stone away are
33:32
still there I stood in the garden flower
33:36
bed where Christ did
33:38
that's why Mary thought he was the
33:40
gardener he likes flowers I've been in
33:45
the upper room I spoke on the Sea of
33:47
Galilee I was in Shiloh where Joshua led
33:50
the people into the Promised Land that's
33:53
where they first settled I was there I
33:54
saw every spiritual spirit round the
33:58
thing that had been opened by all these
34:01
mighty men and women of God and I think
34:03
the thing that moved me the most was you
34:05
could hold a Bible and stand not quite
34:09
but it seemed I can see from one end
34:10
Israel to the other it's not very big
34:12
but everything in the Bible happened in
34:16
that small area and they have kept those
34:21
places they've kept them and they like
34:26
Americans
34:27
but Israel loves Trump
34:31
they love him because in the short
34:33
amount of time what he was able to do
34:35
for that country that's never been done
34:36
before it was actually promised by many
34:39
presidents in our country but they never
34:41
did it he did it and they all loved him
34:46
it doesn't matter how old they are
34:47
doesn't matter if they're Orthodox or
34:49
you know messianic or secular Jews it
34:53
doesn't matter they all love him because
34:56
he's made their country safer he's
34:58
finally announced it is literally a real
35:02
country amen it had the right to that
35:05
land they got the Golan Heights back
35:07
you've got to go everywhere in this
35:08
country because Americans are welcome by
35:10
anybody a general matter if it's
35:12
Palestinians it doesn't matter who it is
35:14
Syrians if they live in that country
35:16
they kind of separate up the land is
35:18
real smart they don't have as much war
35:21
because they sat down and talked to
35:22
these people well they own all the land
35:25
the Palestinians aren't but they made an
35:27
agreement we'll let you live there but
35:28
you'll pay taxes instead of having
35:31
awards that will keep fighting what we
35:32
all live our lives so they don't go in
35:35
their area without permission but
35:38
everybody gets along and so all these
35:40
different sections I think is like ABC
35:42
cently they came up with a plan I was
35:44
amazed at the plan but but the American
35:46
tourists can go to any part of Israel
35:48
they want to because those people know
35:50
they're gonna make money so they welcome
35:54
tourists all the time it's like they
35:56
won't let an Israeli bus driver go into
35:58
one area but they'll let a bus driver
36:01
from that area pick up the Americans and
36:03
bring them in that area and so that's
36:06
why there's not as much war also the
36:09
threat that Trump said if you attack
36:10
them you're attacking me in my country I
36:13
think that helps a little bit God
36:17
purpose for them to be friends and this
36:20
is a season of destiny for Israel it's a
36:23
season of destiny for Korea for England
36:26
amen of course for America and Hollywood
36:32
for priority things got his pinpointed
36:35
to start something between
36:38
2018 and then the 2019 major things
36:41
would happen in each one of those places
36:42
it was set
36:43
of course for their destiny and God made
36:47
sure I got to go to each one of those
36:48
places and declare something for him and
36:51
Korea was the first one at the end of
36:54
the right at the end of the games I was
36:56
invited to speak to a university isn't
36:58
that amazing
37:00
with my twelfth grade education see my
37:04
graduation certificate they wanted me to
37:08
come teaching about heaven and give
37:10
college credits for it and they all did
37:17
very well that was quite interesting I
37:22
lost 12 pounds because I don't like fish
37:28
guess what they ate every day of their
37:30
life
37:31
I had pretzels Brazil nuts and oranges
37:37
that's what I ate for 12 days and in
37:40
Israel it was almost the same I didn't
37:43
like their food either guess what they
37:46
eat a lot of fish the whole hotel
37:52
smelled like fish so I ate like tomatoes
37:59
a roll I again had some kind of nuts I
38:03
think it was almonds or something I ate
38:05
almonds and every now and then I have
38:07
some little dessert thing that was about
38:09
it so I lost 12 pounds there also if you
38:14
go to Israel make sure you're in pretty
38:16
good shape because you will climb up
38:19
everything steps made out of stone steps
38:24
that go forever
38:25
and then you're gonna come back down
38:27
there's no trolley car to take down okay
38:29
you walk up these steps down these steps
38:32
up these mountains down these mountains
38:34
sometimes inside the mountains but you
38:37
walk you're gonna walk those people walk
38:40
no wonder they're all in good shape
38:41
don't ride a camel
38:52
don't walk by mine either
38:56
my heart went out to the wise men as
39:00
they crossed the desert for to hurt each
39:05
with a bunch of camels it wasn't three
39:07
camels with three why's my whole life I
39:12
thought while they had a long journey
39:13
together there must have got each other
39:14
know each other really well right it's
39:16
just a three of them no they each had
39:19
lines of camels and they carried their
39:23
tents their food their food for the
39:25
camels their water their servants their
39:27
homes they carried everything with the
39:30
smelly camels and thinking I have a
39:35
whole new view of being on that camera
39:39
so some of it was funny most of it was
39:42
very powerful as I got to meet some
39:44
really amazing Jewish people they took
39:48
us into the Jewish quarter we had a
39:50
really great tour guide his name is
39:53
Yoshi if you ever plan to go there look
39:55
him up they call him the unofficial
39:57
mayor of tourism he also he's in his 70s
40:01
he's been I forgot three different digs
40:04
actually where the unearthed stuff and
40:06
everything he knows a lot about that
40:07
takes you into the old Roman places
40:09
before Christ was even born
40:11
and you see a lot learn a lot but the
40:14
thing that you never get over is the
40:16
presence of God there and you're so
40:19
impacted by you realize how they live
40:21
their lives and yet they have survived
40:24
survived survived and they have outlived
40:26
all of their enemies which they are very
40:30
pleased with and they'll always make the
40:32
statement no matter what went on they're
40:35
gone and we are still here so God does
40:41
have amazing plans he really does have
40:44
priority list he's working on and he's
40:46
going to complete his priority list it's
40:48
important to pray always pray never stop
40:51
praying
40:52
make sure you declare and decree also it
40:54
is a high level of praying
40:57
and when we pray many times we're asking
41:00
which is good because you don't have it
41:02
right if you don't ask you have not
41:04
because you ask not asking comes in a
41:08
form of the prayer reviews to be been
41:10
doing on most of our lives declaring and
41:12
occurring is another level of Prayer
41:14
where you have so much faith in you you
41:17
know what you say is going to happen
41:18
because you know the word what the word
41:21
says and your faith grows as you step
41:23
out and believe and trust God more and
41:25
do things you you become soulful of God
41:28
and you understand the word come so
41:31
alive to you because you're living it
41:33
you're not just reading you're living it
41:35
and so God does have a timeline in
41:39
heaven I was shown that timeline up into
41:42
heaven so many times I lost count I
41:44
stopped counting but I remember every
41:47
time I've been he has a timeline behind
41:49
his throne and I've seen part of that
41:52
timeline and there's still a lot left
41:53
that hasn't happened and every one of
41:56
those things I saw was not like a date
41:58
it wasn't like March 2nd 2019 it was the
42:03
name of the event that was going to take
42:04
place and there's still things we
42:07
haven't done that the word talks about
42:09
so I know there are people literally
42:11
writing books and sharing from their
42:13
platform it's called all gonna end well
42:16
they've been saying that a long time the
42:18
Mayans lost out they had their last
42:19
chance they're all dead and gone and
42:20
we're still here so the Mayans timeline
42:24
that's gone that was actually written
42:26
down and people said well we don't have
42:27
much time left I want I'll still be here
42:30
and it'll all be gone I'm not going
42:32
anywhere yeah and so God has his
42:34
timeline and there are events we're
42:37
living in one of those events right now
42:39
that he calls the kingdom age and in
42:42
this timeframe of this kingdom age which
42:45
is several generations of time it is it
42:49
is going to not end into the Millennial
42:52
age starts amen
42:55
or right before the Millennial age
42:57
possibly I don't know when that's going
43:00
to end or happen either I just know it's
43:01
not for right now the perros times are
43:04
not for right now this is the day of his
43:09
power
43:09
or not the day of his wrath the most
43:12
important thing you can learn about God
43:14
is what time is it that's why the tribe
43:19
of Judah wouldn't do anything without
43:20
consulting the tribe of Issachar who
43:23
knew the times and seasons of God how to
43:25
operate in it what you needed to operate
43:28
in it what you needed to do to be
43:30
successful in it and the manifested sons
43:33
and daughters will operate just like the
43:34
tribe of Issachar in this time they will
43:37
know what time it is on God's timeline
43:38
and how to live the way you need to to
43:42
be successful so living on earth as it
43:45
doesn't happen is very important to know
43:46
that and to actually live it to believe
43:48
in God let your faith explode in him
43:51
be prepared to celebrate not to escape
43:55
forget escaping I love it
43:59
I love it the father says you've gone
44:01
too far
44:02
you can't go back it's too late to
44:05
escape being great that's what he thinks
44:10
about this time it's a time to be great
44:13
for him great with him amen
44:17
even you don't understand anything I'm
44:19
saying trust me it's not over how about
44:21
that one so roll of your rapture rug
44:26
don't worry about escaping because the
44:29
rapture won't be an escape it will be a
44:32
celebration so even that's not going to
44:37
be what most people think we have to
44:38
escape we have to we have to escape the
44:40
mark of the beast I don't think he's on
44:42
the earth yet you know why he won't be
44:47
able to do much because in this time we
44:49
get stronger and greater with God we
44:52
manifest the power of the Living God and
44:54
do you think so shocking that it will
44:56
stun he'll push darkness back and shift
44:59
this world and change things the
45:02
enterprise couldn't be here it says
45:06
clear in the world until he that is
45:08
withheld is removed the Antichrist
45:11
cannot appear and we're just finding out
45:14
who we are so forget about the rest of
45:17
stuff that is in the father's hands
45:20
jesus said to occupy until he comes back
45:23
not high we also get to put the third
45:29
show on God put the first one on kicking
45:35
Satan out of heaven with all of his
45:37
fallen angels who were angry and bitter
45:39
at their newfound leader who lied to
45:42
them the first thing he said to him was
45:44
a lie everything after that has been a
45:46
lie
45:47
he even lied them when Christ's went
45:49
into hell remember because he had to he
45:51
was telling he's gonna wipe up hell with
45:52
him get ready we're gonna have a show
45:56
oh I'm putting on the biggest show he
46:00
said well wipe him up and people are
46:02
gonna know fine you once and for all I
46:04
have more power I have more authority
46:05
this is my heir my area my realm my role
46:08
here and no one's going to come in here
46:10
and tell me what to do and yet he beat
46:12
him up how many people saw the Avengers
46:14
and saw the Hulk take Loki Beibei Bam
46:19
Bam Bam Bam Bam pretty much that's
46:23
what's gonna happen in the movie I love
46:30
what Jeff says Iron Man shows up first
46:32
in Jesus this is not this is a this is a
46:36
fictional account okay taking some
46:39
license in this because Jesus did melt
46:44
the faces of the principalities they
46:47
melted like laughs so there's an Iron
46:49
Man to the leader of all these that he
46:56
had taken so much time to call in
46:59
because principalities don't sit in hell
47:02
if you understood how hell operated you
47:05
would understand how much that scripture
47:07
what that means in that scripture when
47:10
it says the principalities and powers he
47:13
wasted them and spoiled them well they
47:14
wouldn't even be in Hell normally they
47:17
rule on Thrones around this world
47:20
because Satan was gonna have a big show
47:22
he called them all in all that word went
47:24
everywhere call him in call him in I
47:25
want him to watch put him on the front
47:28
row at the gates of Hell right inside
47:31
the court yard they're gonna see me man
47:33
all stoked I'm a book at my royal robes
47:36
on no he's no shine his stones that at
47:40
that time he still had I got a shine on
47:42
so they you know they glow
47:44
let me fell because of his duty he's
47:47
about to lose it all he had the keys I'm
47:51
in charge of death this was him he
47:54
actually said these words he bragged
47:56
about it on purpose so here comes all
47:59
the hierarchy all the little demons have
48:01
to be way in the back screaming and
48:02
complaining whining why they'd be guys
48:05
coming here they all hate each other by
48:07
the way there's no love and Satan's care
48:10
so he's gonna have a good show and all
48:12
this time Christ is saying nothing just
48:15
waiting for his father to say something
48:17
or hear something third day lightning
48:21
bolt hits hell Brett when the show is
48:23
gonna start you know in order to have a
48:26
show you have to have lights you got to
48:29
have action you have drama you have a
48:33
lot of noise and somebody recording it
48:39
all oh don't forget the audience got to
48:45
have the audience so Satan had all
48:48
planned out from his master table or he
48:51
had planned all this out right figured
48:54
God didn't come the first day God wasn't
48:56
didn't know where he was he went smart
48:57
enough didn't come the second day he was
48:59
afraid he wasn't strong enough so now
49:01
we're moving him from the back of Hell
49:02
up here we're gonna plan a show that did
49:06
not happen
49:07
not the way they planned so when that
49:11
happened there was a little shudder in
49:13
hell they remember the lightning bolt
49:15
that's what took him out of heaven that
49:19
was the father's only thing he had to do
49:22
with the whole show it was his sons
49:24
stands up and the fire of God comes out
49:27
of his hands it begins to melt one by
49:29
one the little guys in the back row were
49:31
really GAD they weren't they were glad
49:32
they weren't on the front row there's a
49:35
big opening towards the back of Hell
49:37
from the courtyard they were trying to
49:39
cram themselves they were running so
49:42
fast screaming trying to get away from
49:45
the Son of God melt
49:47
everything literally running down this
49:50
this darkened tunnel they were screaming
49:52
and jumping running on top of each other
49:55
they didn't care the principalities were
49:57
getting the front row and then he melts
50:01
half the faces of all them some of them
50:03
managed to get away when I was a little
50:05
girl I would see them when I went into
50:07
my places I see these demons their heads
50:10
were like this big there was this thick
50:12
their eye sockets were melted their
50:15
mouths were disfigured and melted and I
50:17
was standing there and go I wonder what
50:19
happened to them what what happened to
50:23
them I don't think hell can melt their
50:26
own demons I mean I didn't really know
50:28
until I was taken back in time and I was
50:31
shown it now I understand completely I
50:36
don't know why you're chiming this God
50:38
but I'm enjoying every moment of it
50:42
until I got the call from the producer
50:44
saying I'm gonna make a resurrection
50:46
movie want me to give me spiritual
50:47
content and trust me they want it in the
50:56
movie he is not afraid of what any man's
51:02
gonna say he's waiting 15 years to do
51:05
this film and he doesn't care he's a
51:07
businessman okay it says easier to work
51:11
with business people than religious
51:13
people because if it doesn't line up
51:14
with everybody's doctrine they don't
51:17
want it and they'll crucify you if you
51:20
put it in there and they said no don't
51:22
put it in there he's ignoring every one
51:23
of them I've waited 15 years to do this
51:26
movie I'm doing it God's way I want my
51:28
god wants and I don't care what anybody
51:29
says amen so I'm very excited about this
51:36
whole thing because the world will
51:38
finally know Jesus Christ is the son of
51:40
God not good
51:50
so God informed me several years ago
51:52
that I'm gonna put a third show on but I
51:55
won't be doing it you will it's for the
52:00
sons and daughters that's why the earth
52:02
cries out for them to stand up and do
52:05
something he said I did the first show
52:10
my son the second show you all get to do
52:12
the third one lights action drama lots
52:16
of yelling raising the dead that were
52:20
cremated I'm serious but if you go to a
52:26
funeral and he says get up there and
52:28
take the lid off that John you command
52:29
that spirit to come back in that body
52:30
are you going to do it you should say
52:34
that very loudly because trust me if he
52:38
says that to you you are gonna know it
52:41
is the Son of God you're not in your
52:44
head gonna even have there's no time to
52:45
even argue with that when he says
52:47
something you get so empowered you're
52:49
like sure take the lid off the jar I
52:53
command your spirit to come back into
52:55
that body in Jesus name and all the
52:57
ashes come out like a whirlwind and
52:59
there's the person
53:05
that is part of the third show-stopping
53:09
earthquakes and then telling them put it
53:12
back the way it was before they happen
53:15
we are over the earth we are over the
53:19
ocean we over all of the atmosphere over
53:23
every creature on this earth we have a
53:27
Thornton dominion over them we're just
53:30
finally going to demonstrate it so don't
53:35
ask me where's that in the word I just
53:37
told you it's Genesis 1:26 and in Romans
53:44
what talks about the manifested sons or
53:46
daughters that is you don't wait for
53:52
some great name person to come stand
53:54
somewhere and do it cuz stuffs gonna
53:57
happen everywhere and who's gonna do
53:58
something about it we are with Jesus
54:01
Christ
54:04
don't think I'm too old you don't care
54:07
for ninety nine or nine if he picked you
54:11
he picked you and you sit in your seats
54:14
all you want to say I don't want to do
54:15
that it won't work
54:18
he has this wonderful powerful way about
54:21
himself to influence you and convince
54:25
you especially if he comes in person
54:29
you're gonna go and you're gonna think
54:33
you're gonna melt into the ground when
54:36
those eyes
54:37
that blaze with passion for you look in
54:40
you and say but I need you to do this
54:44
you're gonna run over top of everybody
54:46
you know you're not gonna care what one
54:48
person says you're not gonna be very
54:50
quiet by the way practice yelling people
54:59
go on quiet you won't be quiet on that
55:01
day I was a person who never spoke I was
55:07
happy never speaking to anybody I think
55:09
I spoke to two kids people in high
55:11
school I wasn't trying to be a part of
55:14
anything
55:15
care at a tribe they spoke all the time
55:18
I didn't need to hear someone else
55:19
talking I was the person who never of us
55:23
the wallflower the one who never wanted
55:25
to say anything I didn't want to hug
55:26
people I had enough people hugging me at
55:28
home I didn't want to hug people I cared
55:31
about him you know god help him I did
55:36
help them my dad did so I helped my help
55:39
my dad helped people but still I was a
55:41
person who never wanted to be known I
55:43
would have never had pink hair on my
55:46
head I like my long blonde hair I didn't
55:51
ask for pink hair Jesus Christ came in
55:56
person sat on my loveseat at 4 a.m. put
56:02
his arm around me so I thought my body
56:03
was gonna melt into his it began to tell
56:06
me what my destiny was this is after
56:09
they've been taking me to heaven since
56:10
1996 now he tells me the other side of
56:13
the story and then he hooks him he goes
56:16
and we need you to have pink highlights
56:18
in your hair I didn't dare voice
56:24
anything who was gonna tell the Lord of
56:25
glory I don't want to do that and then
56:30
in my head I'm thinking why you know why
56:33
my daughter's gonna get married in two
56:35
months the in-laws already think I'm
56:38
strange
56:41
all over takers walk down the aisle with
56:43
pink he knows every thought you're
56:50
thinking and he looks at me and pleases
56:54
are on your toes because it is
56:57
absolutely necessary that when the world
57:00
sees you and they hear you and they know
57:03
you know us but you love and you have
57:08
pink hair you're never going to judge
57:09
them they'll listen to anything you say
57:12
we need that pink hair is heaven's
57:14
marketing plan I'm sure there's not a
57:19
pastor on this earth that ever thought
57:21
God would use pink hair as a marketing
57:22
plan I've met some of them for four
57:29
years I served so many pastors of
57:31
different events in my city love them
57:34
they knew me so well but I had gone over
57:37
the deep end when I had pink hair put on
57:38
my head
57:39
I want y'all y'all need to get more of
57:44
the Spirit in you because you could too
57:47
son you know know me by the spirit not
57:50
the not the flesh right it's a flesh
57:53
test and just get ready for you ask you
57:56
to have green hair I wouldn't encourage
57:59
you to go get it because he has a
58:02
purpose for it and I've been trying to
58:04
explain ever since I've had this since
58:05
2006 I've had pink hair I've won more
58:09
people to Lord then I had my entire life
58:11
before that it works just stand
58:14
somewhere if you're over fifty someone's
58:16
gonna come and ask you what is that well
58:21
on Heaven's ambassadora they have hair
58:23
like this in heaven and then I start
58:26
talking about the things they like cuz
58:28
Jesus is telling me the Holy Spirit is
58:29
telling me the whole time I'm stinging
58:30
in front of them talk about the talk
58:32
about the extreme sports in heaven I was
58:35
talking to two teenage girls on the
58:36
beach I think Jen was there
58:40
yeah they had skateboards with them but
58:44
you know a skateboard a skateboard right
58:46
so I start talking about extreme sports
58:48
in heaven where you don't even need a
58:49
helmet you do 100-foot jumps
58:53
and your skateboards got fire coming out
58:55
of it
58:57
and they drop their skateboards dock 14
59:01
what are you talking about I was told
59:06
there wasn't a god
59:07
oh no I've met him I been to his home
59:11
called heaven and you would not believe
59:13
the things I have there and did you know
59:16
he made you and did you know you lived
59:19
in him before you came here they don't
59:22
care about any doctrine they've only
59:24
heard God hates them because they're
59:26
sinners they've only been told about
59:29
Hell not God so I talked to them for 40
59:33
minutes they're so filled so excited
59:35
about God do you want to know where they
59:36
could go they went to give yourself to
59:39
him they want to know where can I go
59:40
that I can hear this stuff I said well I
59:41
don't know how many places are here yet
59:43
but the church I go to they do teach
59:46
about heaven that there is a heaven did
59:48
you teach you how to live your life set
59:50
your blessing him helping people that's
59:52
the way you talk to people you're not
59:56
you're not accusing them of anything I
59:58
talk to them like they know him and
60:00
that's what God said talk to them like
60:03
they already know us then they're
60:05
interested so in this time learn how to
60:09
talk to people and you know what the
60:12
angel standing around you they're gonna
60:14
help keep you protect you especially if
60:16
you command an army from heaven that
60:19
might be new to you too don't be afraid
60:21
by that we are over the Angels is that
60:26
true everybody
60:27
are we gonna judge them and they succumb
60:30
well you can't judge somebody that
60:32
you're under you need to start thinking
60:37
about what the Bible says about you make
60:38
a list stand in front of a mirror and
60:40
say it every day I did that I did it all
60:46
the time and one day Jesus walked in my
60:48
wall and the wall of my home and he
60:50
keeps walking in there all the time it's
60:53
not impossible for you to go to heaven
60:55
and see heaven it's quite wonderful but
61:01
I'm not ready to go over there I know
61:04
people go the cry when they have to
61:05
leave I don't cry because I'm not gonna
61:08
leave here without fulfilling everything
61:11
he wants me to do and that is to help
61:14
campaign for this coming election
61:17
I'll have I have a new studio I'm gonna
61:20
have a broadcast at least once a week
61:22
jump on the Trump 2020 train give
61:26
reports from heaven the whole time but
61:28
God is saying and then you see things
61:30
happen through the whole election God
61:34
has a plan for this country to make it a
61:38
pattern for other countries leaders to
61:40
one after we just have to love those
61:43
that don't understand or don't like it
61:45
but their lives even their lives are
61:48
better than they were before even they
61:52
are benefiting I know people who blasted
61:55
and yelled and hollered and yet they're
61:56
small businessmen they get 25% reduction
61:58
on their taxes and they don't say no
62:03
they're gonna vote for him this time
62:05
because something actually happened
62:08
during someone's term that did something
62:12
to help them amen everybody stand up
62:16
we're gonna declare something you don't
62:19
have to but you can and then we're gonna
62:22
have some Q&A time it's hard if I have a
62:28
Q&A if I start with cueing any time I
62:30
never want to stop it's hard to stop so
62:33
I can stop what I'm talking about so we
62:35
can have some because people have
62:37
questions and it's my London or my
62:40
favorite things to do
62:41
is to answer people's questions if I
62:43
know I'll answer if I don't I just say I
62:45
don't know amen so we're going to clear
62:48
something say father I am your child I
62:52
want your will your way in my life and
62:58
for this earth so I declare the upcoming
63:04
election in 2020 the one you have chosen
63:09
will win in a landslide you will show
63:14
your favor over that administration and
63:18
give them new things to do to help our
63:23
country be greater than it ever was
63:26
before
63:27
and God because I care I pray for the
63:31
other side the blinders we've taken off
63:35
the rise they will stop hating they will
63:39
start loving that they will benefit from
63:43
this whole thing because this is your
63:46
plan and we want your man so help the
63:51
others God because we're running our
63:54
race your will your way hallelujah
64:01
[Applause]
64:06
we need to shout on that everybody
64:15
[Applause]
64:23
we're we need more in the body of Christ
64:27
like cat that lays it down I mean 24
64:33
years because she's heard God and she's
64:36
not ashamed to proclaim what God has
64:38
told her regardless of the persecution
64:41
she takes and I know she doesn't say but
64:43
it's got to be something else on
64:46
Facebook and different things and quotes
64:48
and things that people say and she is
64:51
dedicated committed to her God and so as
64:55
we go into the question and answers we
64:57
want to take an offering for her and
64:59
pass offering the offering baskets for
65:02
her while we're doing this because this
65:04
is a fun time so go ahead and have a
65:06
seat and pastor Brooke if you and Renato
65:10
could take these mics so that we can get
65:13
every question on it so our streamers
65:16

65:18

65:21

65:52
nights
65:53
we've been empowered with a new boldness
65:56
if that's possible I don't know what
65:59
we're gonna be like but father God we
66:03
are going into an upgrade we are all
66:05
upgrading so Lord we want a blessed camp
66:08
we want to bless this ministry we wanted
66:11
to go out to the outermost parts of the
66:14
earth and Lord she doesn't even need
66:17
this money because she's got you we need
66:21
to give and we need to support and we
66:24

66:27
so that we can then benefit within
66:30

66:42
for leading and guiding our giving
66:43
tonight in Jesus name okay tell us tell
67:00

67:02
know some people understand this and
67:03
this is what we're gonna do
67:05
this is the order we're gonna do on this
67:07
side on this side and on this side we're
67:09
gonna rotate back and forth we're not oh
67:10
you'll be on this side pastor Brooke on
67:12
this side and what you do you'll take
67:14
your questions we'll have the questions
67:15
come up on this side or this side and
67:18
ask the questions here so we can have
67:19
the mics so then it'll be clear for the
67:21
cameras too so awesome and so you can
67:26
give online at WWE or on your mobile
67:31
phone text go mz2 seven seven nine seven
67:34
seven and you'll seek a career there or
67:37
you can give cash or check now the
67:43
questions I want to say just a couple of
67:45
words about the questions some people
67:47
think they don't have one until they
67:48
hear the first one the answer and then
67:51
everybody has questions and I'm a detail
67:54
person that's why God picked me
67:55
so most questions have a lot of detail
67:58
to them so and you're gonna love every
68:01
one of them it doesn't matter you're
68:02
going to learn from this Q&A session but
68:05
try to keep it to questions about heaven
68:07
itself about the spirit realm activities
68:11
or about the time we're living in right
68:13
now because some people go into it's not
68:17
it's easy to answer a personal question
68:19
about yourself because most of the stuff
68:22
he gives me is for the corporate body of
68:24
Christ so it should be something that
68:26
everyone here would be interested in I
68:29
wanted to know the answer to it makes it
68:31
much easier for me because if I answered
68:33
everybody's personal question we would
68:36
literally be here all night long so try
68:38
to keep it to something and just one
68:40
question okay somebody showed up one
68:42
time they had 115 questions on the lid
68:45
I heard from a prophet a long time ago
68:50
that you are a wise person if a prophet
68:53
is coming and you want a question you
68:55
write it down and hand it to that
68:58
prophet put your phone number on it or
69:00
your email and eventually you'll hear
69:03
something back but if you come
69:05
unprepared then you're gonna go over
69:07
with whatever God gave them to share
69:09
when you missed your chance to ask
69:12
something that you want to know so
69:13
always come prepared okay and any of the
69:16
questions if you don't get to come up
69:19
here and speak in them write it on a
69:21
piece of paper and leave it at the
69:24
products table with your first name and
69:26
your age and where you're from because I
69:29
am literally looking for a lot of new
69:33
questions for book three and we're gonna
69:35
change out all the ones that are on our
69:37
website so we're always looking for new
69:39
questions so it's not going to be lost
69:40
okay so let's just get the first
69:44
question when the father asks us to
69:48
resurrect the ashes can it be a person
69:55
this would be somebody who just recently
69:58
died yeah you're not learning upbringing
70:02
they're not coming anyway somebody been
70:06
dead it's been 10 years you think
70:08
they're gonna leave heaven look I know
70:11
you've walked on truly Europe they're a
70:14
part of your lives but if you could go
70:17
there and see how they were living you
70:19
wouldn't ask them to come back just be
70:21
prepared when you go and you know what's
70:24
gonna happen to get there then no wonder
70:26
they didn't want to come back down here
70:28
in their old bodies so it would normally
70:32
this would be somebody who just died
70:34
like at a funeral and you were at the
70:36
funeral something like that unless one
70:38
thing so this is help this is what
70:40
happens I was shown in the future and
70:42
the entire plane crashes everybody's
70:44
burn up in the plane like to ashes and a
70:47
believer goes in resurrects everybody up
70:49
that burned up in the plane they all
70:51
come back to life they get their bodies
70:53
back they even have their clothes on
70:54
that is something that will be that will
70:56
happen that's like a greater work or
70:58
Manifest asunder so that could be
71:01
something like that but it's usually
71:02
something that just happened okay so I
71:08
know that the Lord promotes us on earth
71:10
as we're faithful right so are we going
71:13
to be continued to be promoted when
71:15
we're in heaven into eternity well God I
71:20
think everybody heard that question I
71:22
kind of say it a god promotes us on the
71:24
earth and it says that he's the one who
71:26
lifts up and puts down we know he does
71:28
that and sometimes even unexpected
71:30
people unknown people he does that and
71:32
he's certainly gonna do that a lot like
71:34
over the next 20-30 years you're gonna
71:35
see that happen a lot down here God has
71:38
his ways to reward you when you get to
71:40
heaven and you cannot say no to that
71:43
reward that reward you'll never forget
71:45
for the rest of your existence and that
71:48
is the main way God rewards you in
71:50
heaven for all you've done on the earth
71:52
for him even things you didn't even
71:54
think he was aware of but he doesn't
71:56
stop rewarding you so it's not so much
72:00
like you have to be promoted in heaven
72:02
you're already promoted because you move
72:05
there the gift he put in you people will
72:07
run to see you use that gift so you in a
72:10
way your whole life changes whatever
72:12
your passion is he putting you to do
72:14
with your natural gift he prepares
72:16
everything in heaven for you to use that
72:18
gift so a lot of people going to come
72:20
they're going to celebrate who you are
72:22
they're gonna love it so that way is a
72:24
non-stop promoting of you because of the
72:27
way he designed heaven so you're gonna
72:29
love it you're gonna just love it Kat
72:33
has the Lord shown you much about the
72:35
destiny of New York and Connecticut I'd
72:38
like to know better how to pray and I am
72:40
from those areas originally I do know
72:42
that New York is going to become a
72:43
region of light in this country yes
72:47
because of and he even explained vine
72:49
because they were willing to open their
72:52
borders to bring all the unwanted the
72:55
ones coming to find rescue New York was
72:58
very unique for God's purpose for it and
73:00
they fulfilled that purpose that many
73:02
purpose he had was for them to welcome
73:04
them in people came from all over the
73:06
world set up their own settlements and
73:08
then because some of them became very
73:10
great people
73:11
they went to other places but New York
73:12
was like a birthing place for people for
73:15
their destinies for their gifts and God
73:17
is planning to honor that it will become
73:19
a region of light where one point
73:21
there'll be no crime no sin and no
73:23
sickness and I was I was born in New
73:28
York so I also know that I left heaven
73:31
and was sent to New York New York Yankee
73:40
sent all the way to the deep south I
73:44
promised to tell people that okay if you
73:46
come to floor don't worry about being
73:47
carried off by an alligator you probably
73:49
will never even see an alligator they
73:51
don't roam they're not like the Buffalo
73:54
they have to stay in the water or their
73:58
hide will fall off the only time you see
74:02
an amount of the water is crossing the
74:04
road to go to another body of water
74:06
their height is about this thick and the
74:09
dinosaurs even we see how these
74:11
questions go the dinosaurs on the earth
74:13
when it was made the first time they
74:15
could not have survived on the earth
74:17
like it is now because those dinosaurs
74:19
had to stay in continual mist and water
74:22
so the atmosphere was like a continual
74:25
mist the sky was a peachy pink the Sun
74:28
wasn't there he lit the original earth
74:30
with his glory and they did wrong with
74:32
watch her angels that's why they find
74:34
footprints it's not a human footprint
74:36
it's a watcher angel they hadn't flesh
74:38
on them there is a history lesson go
74:41
ahead what's the next question first of
74:44
all I want to say thank you for being
74:46
the gift and the wrap the Revelator day
74:49
you are so we love you and the other one
74:52
is without giving too much away when you
74:54
us to expect your next book and King
74:58
without giving all of it away what to
75:01
expect in the next book I am working on
75:04
the next book but God has a timeline for
75:06
that and he says the movie has to come
75:08
first because it'll take one-third of my
75:11
life every year to work in the movie in
75:14
Hollywood on the movie and I have to be
75:17
honest I have to be then when they do
75:19
anything because of the spirit realm
75:20
they've never seen it so even though we
75:22
give them sketches and drawings they're
75:24
not
75:24
quite sure the activity or the words
75:27
that were spoken at that time what does
75:28
the atmosphere feel like so they have
75:30
creators who are going to work on all
75:32
the spirit realm stuff I have to be
75:34
present when that's done as you present
75:36
when they actually create the sets I
75:38
have to be present when they do the
75:39
filming and so I'll probably get the
75:41
weekends off and that's going to take 18
75:43
months just when they get to that part
75:45
so I'll be working on an off on book 3
75:48
it will be 3 times bigger then it'll be
75:51
the last one called revealing heaven
75:53
number 3 so he started a relationship
75:56
with you in heaven in book 1 and book
75:59
two increases in every level it shows
76:01
you more of what's in heaven book 3 is
76:03
going to show things that will shock you
76:05
and stun you that's in heaven it'll
76:08
it'll have a picture of a human soul I
76:10
can tell you that literally how he made
76:12
your soul how it operates will be in the
76:15
book even the scene from the third day
76:17
in hell I can tell you that will be when
76:19
the illustrations I have 25
76:21
illustrations I'm working on I always do
76:23
those first and then he gives me the
76:25
chapter titles of what to write about
76:26
because I know so much about it it's
76:29
going to be stunning i opening and you
76:33
will celebrate a lot when you see the
76:35
things that are that are going to be in
76:36
that third book they'll even be prophecy
76:38
at the end about the future and even
76:41
some scenes from the future like one of
76:43
the planets that will be created when
76:45
the new earth is made so it's gonna be
76:51
pretty cool since we are part of the
76:54
putting on the third show like the X
76:59
power 'full first show and second show
77:01
can you tell us anything about that that
77:04
you might know
77:05
and one other thing anything about John
77:08
F Kennedy jr. um I have not seen John F
77:12
Kennedy jr. in heaven that doesn't mean
77:14
he's not there heaven is bigger than our
77:17
whole galaxy it's a plan it's a world
77:19
it's not a flat place and almost every
77:22
picture I've seen of heaven all they can
77:23
draw as the throne room they don't know
77:26
they know there's a throne room there so
77:27
you see a picture of the throne room
77:28
right and usually the father and the son
77:32
are on the back wall and there's like a
77:34
mass of millions of people I can tell
77:36
you
77:36
not like that the throne-room is in the
77:38
middle the throne is in the middle of
77:40
the throne room and there's four sets of
77:42
steps that go up there so everybody can
77:44
run up and see them whenever they want
77:45
to
77:46
so that part needs a little correction
77:48
because he's not on the back wall away
77:50
from everybody the throne room expands
77:52
because it's alive he can hold as many
77:55
people as he wants to I can just tell
77:57
you the third show would be one of the
77:58
greatest of all because it's what God
78:00
has purpose went from the time we lived
78:03
in him and he sent us and took our
78:06
little spirit man and knit it together
78:08
in her mother's womb with our flesh body
78:11
we can't make a spirit man people we
78:15
can't make anything that has made out of
78:17
spiritual content we just can't
78:19
that's God's only God can do that part
78:22
so there is no life until the spirit is
78:25
attached to that data flesh and we will
78:28
see so many powerful things some of the
78:29
things I've been talking about even
78:30
tonight will be part of that third show
78:33
but one of the things I don't talk a lot
78:35
about is the presence of the glory the
78:38
presence of the glory will be so
78:40
powerful most people don't know what the
78:42
glory is they know it's probably going
78:45
to be beautiful it's going to be amazing
78:46
it literally is like carrying the life
78:49
of God yourself and in operating at
78:53
sometimes without measure everyone has a
78:59
measure the work talks about us
79:01
operating in a measure god gives those
79:03
measures but some of the manifests the
79:04
sons of daughters who will be everyday
79:06
people will operate when they're
79:08
operating it'll be like without measure
79:10
the power be so tremendous that
79:13
sometimes it will impact an entire state
79:16
when something is demonstrated or done
79:18
sometimes it will impact an entire
79:20
country what will happen I know the Dead
79:23
will be raised in mass like thousands at
79:27
one time by one person and so these are
79:30
some of the things and this is part of
79:32
the third show it won't be one day it's
79:37
not going to be like you know in hell on
79:39
the third day that was a day and
79:42
heaven it wasn't just a de space-time
79:45
there's no time in heaven but it it
79:47
wasn't something he could do if there
79:49
was time you think about one third of
79:51
the Angels he kicked out along with
79:53
their leader that probably if there was
79:56
time would have been a while along
79:58
enough for them to have a big party
79:59
going on the whole time and pretty sure
80:01
that happened because they were all
80:04
happy he was kicked out they you think
80:06
about it heaven was holy it was pure it
80:10
was undefiled they all loved one another
80:12
they work together you know like
80:14
brothers did God made tribes of angels
80:17
for very specific purposes they all knew
80:20
their own purpose they were happy about
80:22
why he made them to do the Army was
80:24
there they had no enemy to fight there
80:28
was no enemy but God had made an army
80:31
for the specific person purpose of
80:34
fighting against the dark army there was
80:37
no dark army until Lucifer decided to
80:40
take over they knew who their enemies
80:43
would be from that point on and so I
80:46
just can tell you this that the show is
80:49
going to be tremendous it will be
80:50
ongoing probably for several generations
80:53
which will also shift the way all of our
80:56
lives will begin to operate for several
80:59
generations after that and I know people
81:01
have a timeline for the rapture nobody
81:04
knows that day except the father and
81:06
he's the one saying this stuff okay he
81:10
showed me the next fifty years of my
81:11
life that doesn't mean it's my last
81:13
assignment
81:14
I just know exactly what I'll be doing
81:16
for the next 50 years what platforms
81:18
I'll be operating for him and I'm
81:20
telling you I just started the fifty
81:22
year or so so I can guarantee you I know
81:26
it's even beyond that time and because
81:29
it doesn't end until God says it ends
81:32
amen and even that I think the probably
81:37
the last big show will be the marriage
81:38
supper of the Lamb I've also been shown
81:41
parts of that it's going to be beyond
81:43
anything you ever imagined it only gets
81:46
better with God you don't lose it's
81:49
worth anything to be a part of him and
81:53
what he wants
81:54
it's not worth anything to help hell
81:57
hell doesn't celebrate anybody they take
82:01
the worst people who sold their self
82:03
literally met the Satan so that really
82:05
does happen - and lies to them like he
82:08
did I mean he did that in heaven right
82:10
he did that on the earth even tried to
82:12
attempt Jesus to do that
82:13
he's never changes them all and so he
82:16
does get people to do all kinds of
82:17
horrific things and he promises them
82:19
with lies I'll give you power Authority
82:21
I'll give you part of my kingdom
82:23
you'll rule with me he tortures them
82:25
worse than anyone else and makes a show
82:28
of it himself in hell he hates them
82:31
worse than anybody they get nothing they
82:33
get worse done to him done to them than
82:36
anyone else who just rejected tries it's
82:39
only worse and bad for them okay so he
82:43
didn't love anyone don't help him don't
82:45
advertise for him it's about time we
82:47
start advertising about the glory God
82:49
and the goodness of the earth and the
82:51
good things that are happening all over
82:52
this earth because I don't think the
82:54
fake news understand that or they don't
82:57
know about it but there are powerful
82:59
things happening right now in this earth
83:00
that God is in charge of that are
83:02
happening about people loving one
83:04
another countries helping each other and
83:06
you never see that that's gonna change
83:09
okay next question I always imagined
83:14
heaven as being the sort of place where
83:16
everybody can fly around and have
83:18
SuperSpeed and stuff so like during the
83:21
kingdom age does that mean people will
83:22
be able to do that here I would say
83:25
since we're all saying on earth as it is
83:28
in heaven I have to see some of that
83:30
happening here and I'm sure at different
83:34
times if you need you - why wouldn't you
83:36
fly
83:40
I mean why wouldn't you he transported
83:45
Phillip through the sky on a chariot
83:49
he's not the only one he did that to
83:52
either so why not because yes to do fly
83:55
in heaven I was take a new place and
83:58
this is C this is what rocks people is
83:59
not the fact that tell me flying heaven
84:01
is who teaches you to do that in heaven
84:04
that the religious minded I get they
84:06
almost like gnash their teeth when I
84:08
tell them things like this because they
84:09
can't see in their head happening I was
84:21
taken to a place in heaven that was this
84:24
massive amusement park it's in my first
84:26
book it really exists I've been there
84:28
several times since then it has the
84:30
impossible impossible impossible things
84:33
happening that you have so much fun with
84:35
doing and this is the thing if somebody
84:39
receive Jesus Christ as their Savior as
84:41
they were dying they will be in heaven
84:46
and they will still use the gift God
84:49
sent them as so if you sent them doing
84:53
wonderful fun things they have movies in
84:56
heaven no defilement no profane language
84:58
no sexuality no graphic violence forget
85:01
it you could there's no ratings they
85:03
don't need them but heaven makes ratings
85:06
for our movies down here our is rotten
85:10
[Laughter]
85:13
pg13 partly good 13 % PG partly good G
85:19
mostly good so remember that when you go
85:23
to watch a movie Superman teaches you
85:30
how to fly huh Christopher Reeves
85:39
Christopher Reeves teaches you to fly
85:44
you think about the humor and all that
85:47
because they have a place where you
85:49
actually learn you don't just jump up
85:52
and do it there's things you have to
85:53
learn in heaven there's things just
85:55
given to you and you do it but he wants
85:57
you to discover things
85:58
I mean he's our Father like you want
86:00
your kids to discover things and then
86:02
you do them how wonderful does that make
86:04
you feel well it's no different in
86:06
heaven so they have a place in heaven
86:08
where you can go and they have stands
86:10
for all your friends and family to come
86:12
watch you learn to fly it doesn't work
86:17
out the first time
86:23
there's more laughter in heaven than
86:25
anything in this earth and people invite
86:28
their friends on purpose to learn
86:31
because they know they're gonna have a
86:33
mini show right there
86:35
so everybody's friends and family are
86:37
waiting because they've already learned
86:38
right they can just dream they have the
86:41
beginners area god smart you could hit
86:43
each other and weren't hurt but why
86:45
right so they have the beginners area
86:47
where you learn basic instructions on
86:49
flying then you have the intermediate
86:51
area then you have whatever you want to
86:53
go in heaven so this is the basic every
86:55
time where the beginners learn and most
86:58
of them get out there and they try to
87:00
fly this is one thing I've seen them
87:03
doing they're trying to fly across the
87:05
air that doesn't work sometimes they
87:06
look like they're rowing a boat I don't
87:08
know what they're doing and some of them
87:10
just throw their selves out there and
87:13
they spin spin spin spin spin spin spin
87:17
spin but your instructor will stop you
87:20
in eventually you learn no this is very
87:25
distance it's just like right just right
87:29
you better learn to laugh there's a lot
87:33
to laugh and sometimes it's you but yes
87:39
you will fly in heaven so why not down
87:43
here you never know what he's gonna do
87:46
with you I walked on there I didn't
87:49
expect that I've been talking about it I
87:52
stepped right off and just kept walking
87:54
and so I was just doing what was normal
87:58
and it became super naturally heaven
88:02
normal so what's the next question so I
88:05
have a lot of visions of the kingdom of
88:07
God and a lot of it's similar I'm
88:09
walking up step Jesus gives me the keys
88:11
and opened the door and I see a lot of
88:13
rooms I see a lot of items he wants me
88:16
to take does that actually change this
88:19
3d realm I mean what's the point in all
88:20
that we're talking about why you're on
88:23
the earth you're talking about why
88:24
you're in heaven if I see the kingdom of
88:26
God and I have a vision and the in Jesus
88:28
gives me something what's on point to
88:30
that there's a point to and I'm sure
88:33
he's got a point
88:34
I'd always know the point but it's the
88:36
same thing
88:37
that how he operates with me he'll show
88:39
me something and it might be years later
88:41
and then I do it that doesn't mean he's
88:43
not going to let you do it
88:45
because he has timing for everything he
88:48
has times he reveals things that's what
88:50
he's doing then there's times he
88:51
activates it was something you do or an
88:55
event that's gonna happen he will
88:56
activate it and then you will actually
88:58
do it and there will be there are places
89:01
built on this earth in spiritual areas
89:04
where because of what we're doing in who
89:07
we are in this time we will have access
89:09
to those places and do things and that's
89:12
probably what he was showing you that
89:14
was awesome I just want to thank you
89:20
first of all for supporting our great
89:22
president because the fake news lies
89:23
about him all the time and I thank you
89:25
for doing that and also I want to also
89:29
thank you that in 2009 my husband and I
89:32
lost our youngest son to an accident you
89:35
came here a few months later for your
89:37
first time here in 2010 mm-hmm and you
89:39
you actually said a portal opened up
89:41
above the ceiling here and you you
89:43
described him you saw him hanging by his
89:45
legs off the porch yeah I want to thank
89:47
you for that because what's his name
89:48
Luke yes it was
89:50
and the for him and the first time I
89:54
heard you speak before you said that I
89:56
was you know my flesh was like what is
89:58
she talking about I mean of course I
90:00
believed in heaven but we believe for
90:02
his bodily resurrection here and it
90:04
happened and I know you said just a
90:06
while ago that that would not happen
90:07
because he doesn't want to come back
90:09
you're not as much as he loves you this
90:12
is how they feel in heaven they don't
90:13
they don't feel like I stay have no
90:15
sorrow they have no grief there isn't
90:18
any in heaven they celebrate knowing one
90:20
day you're going to be there with them
90:22
and their whole focus is you being there
90:24
and to them it's not like 10 years have
90:27
gone by
90:28
they don't even think timewise like like
90:31
we would on the earth so all I can tell
90:33
you is he still feels the same way he's
90:34
still having an awesome time and he is
90:36
watching this meeting and my question
90:39
for you is as far as I know you spoke
90:41
about atheism last night you said that
90:43
all people have got in them he put that
90:47
in them
90:47
and my father is an atheist I've been
90:50
praying for him for 20 years and my
90:52
question is can I command the host of
90:54
heaven to go and save him because I just
90:56
spoke to him on Father's Day and
90:58
nothing's changed
90:59
don't go Bible and anything you're
91:01
hearing or seeing do not go by what the
91:03
evidence is in the natural you have to
91:06
believe what God's Word promises you
91:09
okay he promises you he says if you
91:11
believe in something say and you do not
91:13
doubt in your heart you shall have what
91:17
whatsoever you say so don't change what
91:21
you're saying don't change it okay
91:25
that's the best thing closure I can give
91:27
you okay this is the question I've been
91:31
wanting to ask you for a while in heaven
91:35
there's no sin and so this scripture has
91:39
kind of puzzled me where it says if you
91:43
don't forgive neither will you be
91:45
forgiven and so if you're a Christian
91:49
and there's somebody you hadn't forgiven
91:51
how does that work there's a big
91:54
difference in being angry and upset and
91:56
for unforgiveness consuming you
91:59
unforgiveness is like a spirit to
92:01
consumes you just being angry and upset
92:03
for somebody and you don't want to say
92:05
you know it's okay there's a big
92:08
difference
92:09
God is the only one who can judge that
92:11
he's not turning people away because
92:13
they had a reason to be angry or upset
92:15
and you don't want to speak to somebody
92:17
or if you think about him you it hurt
92:19
you inside it's more you losing stuff
92:22
from your soul loose all that all the
92:25
trauma whatever you experience from them
92:27
whatever they said you did you need to
92:29
lose that from your soul and the reason
92:32
for that is you won't think about it no
92:34
more because sometimes we're hurting
92:37
worse holding back from something then
92:40
the person who actually did something to
92:42
us and let me tell you if they make it
92:46
to heaven they will not remember that
92:49
people don't remember those things when
92:52
they get to heaven they love you no
92:53
matter who you are and they don't want
92:55
anyone suffering over something they
92:57
caused to happen on
92:58
or something someone on the earth did to
93:01
them because that is what Satan will do
93:03
he will take whatever caused you to feel
93:06
that way and he will ram it down you
93:08
everyday and he will make that that that
93:12
block longer and bigger he'll cause that
93:17
division between you to be stronger if
93:19
you let him do that so God says look at
93:22
what's happening to you and deal with
93:24
that first
93:25
because when that's dealt with you it
93:28
will become be very easy one day for you
93:30
to say I'm just gonna let it go and I'm
93:31
going to forgive them but the more you
93:33
dwell on it and meditate on those things
93:35
it will get stronger have a stronger
93:37
hold on you
93:38
so in God even said the the person who's
93:41
carrying that the person who's carrying
93:43
that in them it's because they're
93:44
suffering from something and yet the
93:47
person who caused it probably isn't even
93:48
thinking about anymore
93:49
or maybe they are maybe they're just
93:51
being hateful to you but their freedom
93:53
comes when your freedom comes so don't
93:58
let that be something that consumes your
94:00
Reks your life or your destiny because
94:02
that happened to you don't carry it you
94:04
loose it what you loose on earth they
94:06
will loose in heaven and you will get to
94:08
a place where it doesn't even affect you
94:10
then you can say this even though I
94:13
don't feel like this in my flesh I
94:15
choose as an act of my will to forgive
94:18
that person and that way your emotions
94:20
are not even involved okay I kept Hey I
94:33
just wanted to thank you first of all
94:34
for your first book I took a book to
94:38
Venezuela after my mother passed away
94:40
and everybody got set free from greevey
94:44
and yes and from depression they were so
94:49
sad after they read your book I told him
94:51
this is was true well my question
94:55
tonight is an originally from Venezuela
94:58
I've been here 40 years mm-hmm
95:00
has the Lord show you anything about the
95:03
evil government be in Venezuela removed
95:07
absolutely soon absolutely is shown he's
95:10
talked to me about Venezuela and
95:12
actually I was having the event in
95:13
Orlando and a woman came all the way
95:16
from Venezuela right when it started
95:19
brought me the Venezuelan flag and said
95:22
I'm giving you to this to take before
95:25
the course of heaven and before the
95:27
Father himself to bring a resolution for
95:29
our country so that it can be free to
95:31
the people who want to serve you there
95:33
will be free to serve you and God said I
95:35
will do it God said it only takes one
95:43
person sometimes to move his heart and
95:46
then this woman came for only that
95:49
reason all the way from that country
95:50
with that flag so God would be able to
95:53
do something because of her words and
95:55
what she declared and she was from there
95:58
he cannot reject or let her words drop
96:01
to the ground so you will see something
96:03
major happened in Venezuela what you say
96:06
that's what I've been doing I can't be
96:08
clear in the Venice oil I set free and I
96:11
tell my family there's be set free by
96:13
the Word of God the power of God amen I
96:16
[Applause]
96:22
would like to say one more thing about
96:25
the woman who talked about unforgiveness
96:29
especially especially if something
96:32
happened between you and a loved one I
96:34
started to start to talk about that than
96:37
I didn't and finish it no matter what
96:39
relationship you had here if that person
96:43
goes to heaven they will have more love
96:45
for you than they ever had down here on
96:48
this earth love you cannot even
96:50
understand in your mind right now you
96:53
cannot conceive of the love of God
96:55
living inside of somebody who has hope
96:58
for you who is declaring over you that's
97:01
asking God to bless you even if they
97:03
didn't treat you right when they were
97:04
here if they died suddenly and you were
97:07
not expecting it
97:08
they understand God understand sometimes
97:10
that can create a wound and you don't
97:12
let that won't be there that person is
97:15
having the time of their life they're
97:17
not just exist
97:18
ting they're living they live in his
97:21
love they're filled with his life and
97:23
the greatest thing they would ever want
97:25
for you is for you to complete your
97:27
destiny they may
97:30
their destiny may be finished in heaven
97:32
sometimes some people don't realize that
97:35
I've even seen young people who were
97:37
raised up here on this earth and when
97:40
they got to heaven they finished their
97:41
destiny so even young people don't miss
97:43
that and and you may heart have a hard
97:46
time understanding that but God still
97:48
has plans for children or for people and
97:51
they have a destiny their ultimate
97:54
destiny in heaven is to be that gift
97:56
whether it's to run a golf course or a
97:58
fishery or a carnival or a you know a
98:03
rodeo have a line of bakeries in heaven
98:07
whatever that gift was they never got to
98:08
use on the earth they will still use
98:10
that in heaven but the thing that I
98:12
noticed the most on there is how much
98:14
love people have I feel ways of it
98:16
coming from the people these are the
98:17
ones who've moved home to heaven and how
98:20
much they care about their family
98:21
members and they're declaring over every
98:24
member of their family not just one of
98:26
them
98:27
so something great happens on the inside
98:30
of them when they see him before the one
98:32
that they came from and the Lord has
98:36
courts him up the steps of the throne
98:37
and gives him literally back to the
98:39
Father they know they are home and they
98:43
know that's who sent them to that earth
98:46
men's I want encourage anybody if you've
98:49
lost somebody recently they're never
98:52
going to forget you they're not going to
98:54
replace you no one can ever replace you
98:56
on this earth but in case you wonder
98:59
it's okay to love again and that may not
99:01
be the right time to tell you but you
99:02
just need to know that one day that may
99:04
happen whoever's in heaven that loves
99:07
you is not going to be angry at you if
99:09
you have someone to love they're
99:11
probably asking God to send you someone
99:13
to love and this is the point when you
99:16
get home you're not married to anybody
99:19
that means you can still have them as
99:22
your best friend and so that you're
99:25
ready that relationship if you are
99:27
married on the earth you're a little bit
99:28
closer together as best friends
99:31
you know the people that weren't so it's
99:33
not like that relationship is gone
99:34
you're just not married for a reason and
99:37
this is the reason and it's a really
99:39
good reason the reason we go home and
99:41
we're not married when we get there we
99:43
come home is the father son or daughter
99:46
you live right next to the people that
99:48
you were married to you'll be best
99:50
friends but there's a legitimate reason
99:53
because we can only have one bridegroom
99:59
it would not be right and the Holy
100:02
Spirit gave me this revelation just a
100:04
couple weeks ago somebody was asking me
100:06
about that and I said well I think
100:07
there's probably a good reason why
100:08
you're not married and so I was told
100:11
this is why you were not married there's
100:13
going to be a marriage in heaven and
100:15
there can only be one bridegroom and
100:18
that bridegroom is for both male and
100:21
female we will be the Bride of Christ
100:24
you can't be married to someone else
100:26
it wouldn't be right that is that was
100:32
very revelatory so knowing people I say
100:34
ask me well how come on can't be married
100:36
I said because you already have a
100:37
marriage waiting on you in heaven and we
100:39
are all patrols to one person and his
100:43
name is Jesus Christ and no matter how
100:46
you feel about each other here when you
100:47
get there you will love him more than
100:50
anyone in existence so there's only one
100:55
bytecode and one bride and we're it so
101:01
maybe I don't know what time it is
101:03
probably have time to take a couple more
101:04
Oh who's next
101:07
okay other than being in the presence of
101:10
the Most High God and Jesus Christ what
101:14
was your most memorable and
101:16
transformational experience that you
101:18
took from heaven in heaven it is hard to
101:22
talk about that there's probably more
101:23
than one one was when I was caught up to
101:27
heaven I don't remember which what time
101:29
that was what what number that was I
101:31
gave up after about a thousand times I
101:33
stopped counting but I remember very
101:37
clearly every time I've gone but the one
101:40
impacted me the most because I'd seen
101:42
Jesus many times on the earth
101:44
doesn't mean I'm familiar with him I'm
101:46
still overwhelmed and undone but this
101:48
was with the father because I knew he
101:51
loved everybody people picture him super
101:52
glued to the throne they think he can
101:54
never leave it that's ridiculous okay he
101:57
goes all over heaven
101:58
he's year's time with everybody in
102:01
heaven but he has his own special place
102:04
he takes you to and it says it talks
102:09
about in the world where it says that
102:11
and all you're getting of knowledge get
102:13
understanding and it says that is
102:16
knowledge of the Holy One that's the
102:17
father so that's why he you hear me talk
102:21
so much about the father Jesus said I
102:23
want you to introduce the father to the
102:24
earth let them know about his love what
102:27
he thinks about them how they live
102:28
before they were here so they'll
102:30
understand and love him like they do me
102:32
because there's a lot about Jesus and
102:34
the board people had encounters with
102:36
Jesus everywhere not so much with the
102:38
father but in this time he wants us to
102:40
know him so he caught me up one time
102:42
when he catches me up I'm always eight
102:44
years old so that's why I remember
102:47
things it's real easy to remember that's
102:49
what he doesn't give me things he
102:51
doesn't use long words even when he
102:53
speaks to me up there he speaks to me
102:54
like I'm a real child
102:56
I have pigtails and I'm very excited
102:59
when I rob didn't want to run up and sit
103:01
on his lap so he can hold me because I
103:03
understand he is my my father he he's
103:08
our Father and I love this goodness Abba
103:11
Father you know or daddy however you
103:13
want to look at it when you get there
103:15
that's how you're gonna think about him
103:16
he caught me up one time but it wasn't
103:18
to the throne he took me by my hand and
103:21
this is the thing about God he can be a
103:23
150 foot tall if he wants to be he means
103:26
big as a source if he wants to be he's
103:29
big okay he can hold anyone in his arms
103:32
no matter how big you are here you're
103:34
not so big that he can't hold you in his
103:36
arms but he can also make himself
103:38
smaller so he can walk right next to you
103:40
so here my look grow pigtails I'm
103:43
looking up at him his hair is filled
103:45
with life it's white it's just beautiful
103:48
as glowing his eyes have flames of fire
103:50
blue flames of fire and he's got the
103:52
most gentlest spirit
103:54
I tell people Jesus is the Waring one
103:57
Jesus is the warring King me but the
104:00
father has such love in him because of
104:03
his son before his sudden you know he
104:05
would pour out his wrath on the others
104:06
and remember that he wiped it out
104:08
remember only did that he's not like
104:10
that anymore because of what his son
104:12
paid for he's loved itself
104:15
kindness itself and he took my hand I've
104:19
been doing this probably for several
104:20
years you took my hand he said come I'm
104:22
gonna take you into my chamber and it
104:26
said on it chamber of understanding and
104:28
it was this place like this massive
104:30
gemstone a huge massive gemstone because
104:33
you have to remember the stones of fire
104:34
are in him we he has one that's his own
104:37
special place that he takes people to
104:40
especially when they come home to heaven
104:41
so he can get to know you better and so
104:44
I walked in there I wasn't afraid of
104:45
anything and then it was this whirlwind
104:48
of the dark glory and that says I hide
104:52
myself in the dark remember the dark
104:54
clouds of glory it looks like a million
104:56
peacock feathers with eyes in them with
105:00
real eyes and that's what he sometimes
105:03
will hide himself in and but when I
105:04
stepped in there with him they were gone
105:06
it was this beautiful place and that
105:07
wasn't massive outside but inside it was
105:09
like it looks like it went forever and
105:11
he looked at me said where would you
105:13
like to go and I said well I want to be
105:16
right here with you I don't need to go
105:18
anywhere he said I can take you to the
105:19
future I can show you the new earth I
105:22
didn't show you things to come on what
105:24
no I know I want to be here with you
105:26
like I I want to be here with you I
105:28
don't need to go in order goes I can
105:30
take you to the past I can show you
105:33
heaven before Lucifer fell I can show
105:36
you before the earth was made don't you
105:39
want to go and I said no right here it's
105:45
where my heart is my heart is for you my
105:51
heart is to do you will you love me
105:54
before I came enough to send your son
105:56
that you love so much that even at one
105:59
point had to turn your very back on him
106:02
because of he had to take all the evil
106:04
and I'm just a little girl saying this
106:06
to him
106:07
Hey
106:13
because you wanted me just like me and
106:17
there's no greater place anyone could
106:20
ever desire to be tend to be with me and
106:24
so I know it blessed his heart so much
106:27
that's why I remember it so clearly that
106:30
it was burned in me and I can't see him
106:35
any other way I can't see him as a god
106:37
of Wrath I can't see him as a God of
106:39
anger or vengeance or a wanting to pour
106:42
something up on you if he is willing to
106:45
give the most precious thing he had for
106:48
us before even while we were yet sinners
106:51
he sent his precious son who was
106:55
everything they did everything together
106:57
before even became Jesus when he was the
107:00
word they created together they went
107:02
everywhere together and he was willing
107:05
to send them you know why so we could
107:07
come back to him that's how much he
107:10
loves people he loves them that's why he
107:13
is long-suffering that's why he said he
107:15
doesn't even want the vilest sinner set
107:17
free but we have to make a choice he
107:22
won't force people to take him and I
107:25
know right now there's people preaching
107:27
that God's going to restore all things
107:30
and they throw in that when they say
107:32
that they literally mean everything he's
107:34
gonna not make a new earth he's gonna
107:36
restore this one he's gonna forgive
107:38
Satan he's gonna remove the fallen
107:40
angels he's gonna make it like it never
107:41
happened that is not what he said and I
107:44
would just say what he said to me
107:46
he said I cannot allow things to come to
107:50
this holy place he said I gave my son
107:53
I'm not keeping you out of heaven I'm
107:55
making a way for you to come to heaven
107:57
because I am not allowing or permitting
108:02
evil wickedness sin to come back into
108:06
this place again and pollute I can't do
108:09
it so I'm not doing something to keep
108:11
you out I did something to let you come
108:13
in but you have to make that choice he
108:17
says so people who say a loving God
108:19
wouldn't send people to hell I don't I
108:21
make a way so they don't have
108:23
go there but they will choose their self
108:25
where they will live so he is a loving
108:29
God but he doesn't want you wouldn't
108:31
want
108:31
he said if I let everyone on earth who
108:34
ever existed to come to heaven then
108:36
heaven would be just like the earth and
108:41
that is not going to happen you would
108:45
not want that to happen yourself so
108:47
unfortunately there are people in hell I
108:50
have been to hell he won't let me talk
108:52
about it because he's still introducing
108:54
heaven it's real it's worse than you
108:57
ever dreamed like heaven is great or
109:00
Mabuse 11 then you ever great dreamed
109:04
Satan loves nobody well I give yourself
109:09
I'm not willing so praise that you won't
109:13
be willing and you will learn to forgive
109:15
and you will learn to but this is the
109:18
thing you can share love love is the
109:19
greatest thing he ever made but love
109:22
includes truth I used to say you can't
109:25
give love and not give truth because
109:27
you're not really loving but actually
109:28
it's part of it so if you love you have
109:30
to share the truth amen
109:33
so don't leave it out somewhere and just
109:35
only share love he'll love people all
109:37
the way to hell because they're choosing
109:39
that love is a wonderful way to show
109:42
them you care and he cares but you can't
109:45
leave out the truth amen
109:49
so any more questions oh she has a
109:54
question from Facebook oh let her answer
109:59
yes we're we want to know what God wants
110:02

sitting in this room have Authority
110:28
enough to do that you don't need to look
110:34
to heaven to bring a lightning bolt down
110:36
here strike someone dead that you don't
110:38
like who is in office it's your
110:41
authority taking over the evil the
110:44
demonic that is ruling that is
110:47
controlling those people that's why we
110:50
were given an army they will bombard
110:52
continually send them continually to
110:55
wherever that person sits whatever their
110:57
title is send them against the demonic
111:00
controlling them I will also add this
111:05
we're living in a time where if they
111:08
won't yield God will take them from the
111:10
earth that would be his last choice but
111:16
because of this time were in that he
111:18
calls holy and powerful for us he wants
111:21
us especially if it's a place he calls
111:23
his own and I don't know why he some
111:27
would be regions of light popping
111:28
because of who will choose to live in
111:30
those places reasons the regions of
111:32
darkness and talk too fast regions of
111:35
darkness will exist because people want
111:38
them and the regions of light will begin
111:43
to produce the glory of God and those
111:46
people will run from those places
111:48
because they so want the evil they still
111:51
want to live that way they want that
111:53
lifestyle they will not be able to live
111:55
in a place for God the glory of God is
111:57
powerful and the reason it's powerful is
111:59
because you're carrying it it's not a
112:01
great wave coming from heaven to sit on
112:04
a place it will be in us Christ in us is
112:09
the hope of glory that glory will become
112:11
a region in places in the earth so what
112:16
you do is begin to live more like God
112:18
declare like him hear him come against
112:23
any evil entities spiritual entities and
112:26
they will begin to be driven out and
112:29
then the influence they had over those
112:32
people will be gone and fear will fall
112:35
on those
112:35
who are leading that's how it works so
112:40
it's in you and the way you live your
112:45
life and what you say and how you
112:48
operate is what will change things in
112:51
this earth Damon okay we're gonna let
112:55
somebody on line ask a question you can
113:00
I have the microphone I wasn't gonna ask
113:03
any of these questions I told him on
113:05
Facebook that I was screams taking
113:07
screenshots of them to save them for a
113:09
future podcast but this one needs to be
113:14
answered and I know you've talked about
113:17
this before but it's kind of a two-part
113:18
question the first part she said can a
113:22
believer who commits suicide go to
113:24
heaven and the reason she asked is
113:27
because Judas had committed suicide in
113:31
the Bible but a young girl said that she
113:34
saw him in heaven I don't know who the
113:37
young girl was but he is in hell and
113:39
even Jesus himself said that he did not
113:42
remain with him number one Judas was
113:45
never a true believer he fought against
113:49
everything Jesus did he wanted Jesus to
113:51
take over the world so he would benefit
113:53
from it he did not have any love for him
113:55
at all and he gave himself to Satan he
113:58
never repented for what he did he went
114:01
out for the guilt he had he hung himself
114:04
judas is in hell and Jesus said father I
114:08
have all those that you gave me save the
114:09
son of perdition he did not have him
114:12
because he was in hell well I can answer
114:15
the other part of that question why she
114:17
probably thought she saw him there is a
114:19
mock heaven in a mock Hell there are
114:21
things that are built in the spirit
114:23
realm there's there all around you a lot
114:27
of them are built by heaven and heaven
114:29
uses them when their angels are sent on
114:31
an assignment there's also something
114:32
built by Hell not very well none of
114:35
their stuff looks very good but they
114:37
have places for the demons to gather and
114:40
in infiltrate places and stuff like that
114:42
and they have built to bring confusion
114:45
to the body because the father is
114:46
catching so many people up to heaven
114:48
and so many people down to hell Satan
114:50
always does something to try to stop it
114:54
bring confusion or counteract it so it
114:57
would look like somebody's not telling
114:58
the truth and one of those places is a
115:00
mock hell and this is the thing about
115:03
the enemy when he thinks he's winning he
115:05
gets very sloppy and then he becomes not
115:08
intelligent and then he'll show people
115:10
he'll this is something you have to test
115:12
spirits if an angel comes up you said
115:15
I'm here to take you somewhere you have
115:16
to say are you from the spirit of the
115:18
Most High God who sent his son you die
115:20
it's very simple you ask them that they
115:22
can't lie there's no way they cannot
115:25
they will disappear or they'll say
115:27
nothing to you but most people just go
115:29
with them and if you go that means
115:33
you're open to be shown whatever if it's
115:35
not an angel there's still demons that
115:37
can have a measure of light in them now
115:40
every one of them look like defiled
115:41
horrible ugly things so if people don't
115:44
ask like someone a leader in the body
115:47
was caught up by supposing aliens to be
115:51
to Saturn did the wings of Saturn and
115:52
this actually happened and they didn't
115:55
test them so they went to the rings of
115:57
Saturn by these demons who said they
115:59
were aliens and they gave them higher
116:00
enlightenment to know about the gods of
116:03
the Egyptians and now they have rejected
116:04
Jesus Christ they date everything we
116:07
judge did everything about him said they
116:09
now serve the God of the Egyptians
116:10
that's why you have to test spirits so
116:13
that was not real saddened by the way
116:14
there was a mock place made in the
116:18
spirit realm to look like that okay
116:24
something that is just very right now
116:27
it's really critical because a lot of
116:30
people are talking about this the
116:31
ascension movement where they get in
116:34
groups and as an act of their will they
116:38
are all group lifted to what they say is
116:42
heaven could they be actually going to a
116:45
mock realm that is is a counterfeit
116:50
since I've never been a part of that
116:52
group I know things like that happen and
116:54
there's always the chance of that
116:57
happening if you don't have the
116:58
opportunity to question who is taking
117:01
you
117:02
I do know that people are doing that I
117:04
know some people got his commission to
117:06
do that there's some people who decide
117:08
in their own soul to do it their self
117:11
that is not wise because we do within us
117:16
the way God made us we do have different
117:18
authorities within us we have abilities
117:21
to come in and speak to things and
117:23
that's how a lot of people got caught in
117:25
the New Age movement years ago now
117:28
people are caught in to all kinds of
117:30
things and they don't understand it's
117:32
not God because this is saying if they
117:34
have a real encounter that's the point
117:37
they made I had a real encounter when a
117:40
lot of people have real encounters but
117:42
where did you go and who took you there
117:45
that's how Satan gets away with these
117:47
mock places and he's caught all kinds of
117:51
people to the mock heaven and they all
117:53
meet mother Mary who was ruling there
117:58
there's always some kind of a thing that
118:00
gives you hints something's not right
118:02
always because I've heard of many
118:04
encounters people have and there's
118:07
always a measure of something that is
118:08
not truth people are caught in the mock
118:11
hell they're shown children in hell that
118:13
is absolutely a lie there are no
118:16
children in hell these people have also
118:18
seen and talked with mother Mary in
118:22
heaven that is not true
118:24
she does not call herself that she is
118:26
Mary who bore Jesus but she worshiped
118:30
worships Jesus Christ as her own Savior
118:32
and then more encounter started building
118:35
and building Satan took a lot of people
118:37
to hell because he enjoyed it and it
118:39
wasn't even the real hell because if
118:41
they had been to the real hell they'd
118:43
still be screaming they wouldn't act
118:46
like it was so nonchalant well I saw
118:48
Christians there and I was told they
118:50
won't help because they wore blue jeans
118:52
how many people got blue jeans on them
118:54
and then they were told that the
118:57
Christians weren't helped because they
118:58
had colored highlights in their hair and
119:01
then somebody else was taken to the mock
119:04
Kalen they were said they're always told
119:06
these are Christians
119:07
these are Christians because they wore
119:09
jewelry the horrible part about it is
119:13
these people believe it because they
119:15
were little
119:16
taken by a spiritual being through the
119:20
spirit room to a place that to them was
119:23
literally real so that's why it's you
119:28
need an understanding of the spirit
119:29
realm you need to understand what that
119:31
place is it's the original realm that
119:34
God made it was made before the physical
119:36
realm in order to make this physical
119:38
planet he had to take like a canvas the
119:42
physical realm and stretch it around
119:43
part of the spiritual realm so we could
119:46
hang all the planets in the sky so we
119:48
would have a place to live and have
119:50
physical body so this stuff happens but
119:54
Satan still has powers I mean he'll do
119:58
anything you can to lie to people if you
120:00
can get them to to be deceived and they
120:03
say yes then they can be taken to places
120:06
and he'll say as an angel light this is
120:09
now your assignment years ago all of
120:10
this world and share this truth and it's
120:12
a lie so it's bringing confusion to the
120:15
body because people thought well I
120:16
thought I thought you couldn't fake
120:19
anything well if you believe the father
120:21
of lies and he's one who created the lie
120:23
yes but there's a way not to be deceived
120:27
okay number one don't want after things
120:30
that you're not aware of or how to
120:32
operate in those places God give you
120:34
commissions if an angel really came from
120:37
him and was supposed to take you you can
120:38
ask that angel if he says yes I was sent
120:41
by the Most High then you should
120:42
certainly go but but this is happening
120:45
everywhere and I've even seen some
120:47
people on shows talking about their
120:51
experiences in Hell and they didn't go
120:52
to the real hell they didn't go to the
120:55
real heaven okay they never talk about
120:57
the glory the splendor the love of God
120:59
they always talk about people who would
121:02
not I've heard him talk about people
121:04
that wouldn't be in heaven I've also
121:05
talked about people who they say are in
121:08
Hell and are not in Hell so you have to
121:11
know who's sharing and you have to know
121:13
yourself how to discern the spirit and
121:15
so if anything comes to you and sit just
121:18
was to go with me you would do if it was
121:21
a person wouldn't it I mean if some
121:23
stranger came to your door and said
121:25
you're supposed to go with me I'm gonna
121:26
take you so and so we're going to go to
121:28
the White House go that would you
121:29
with that person I hope not well it's no
121:32
difference in the spirit room so you
121:35
just have to know who is talking to you
121:38
and if they have the right to talk to
121:40
you you always have the right to refuse
121:41
and if you refuse this God and you've
121:46
tested them they said yes I'm from God
121:47
and you don't go he'll probably give you
121:50
another chance and we're done the line
121:51
to go so yes yes and Satan in the in the
121:58
day is coming one of the one of the
122:00
there's we know their signs and wonders
122:02
but to be unholy signs and wonders it
122:05
talks about them in the Bible too and
122:07
this is the thing he will heal people
122:10
they'll actually have witches don't
122:12
trust a witch don't watch witchcraft
122:14
don't read witchcraft have nothing to do
122:15
with witchcraft
122:16
witchcraft is real it was real back in
122:19
the day of Jesus is still real now and
122:22
none of it is good none of it it is the
122:28
most controlling thing you can get
122:30
involved with and you will be deceived
122:32
over and over again and that's not a
122:34
good thing and this is what Satan will
122:36
do he'll have because people be having
122:39
miracles everywhere right so Satan will
122:41
have his own in the park and they'll say
122:43
these witches will say come and join us
122:45
we're a good coven we love people we can
122:47
heal you do you have something needs to
122:48
be healed and they'll heal them in front
122:50
of everybody
122:51
all Satan has to do is remove the
122:54
disease that he put there and it will be
122:59
a mock healing just to bring deception
123:02
to people so we're a little ways away
123:04
from that happening but as much as you
123:06
can get understanding on the better your
123:09
prepared but I will just say this to you
123:11
Satan has used Harry Potter for years to
123:14
introduce witchcraft is being good if
123:16
you read it loose it from your soul if
123:18
you have it get rid of it if you just
123:20
watch it lay their hands and loose it
123:22
from their soul because the author hates
123:26
Christians and they literally practice
123:30
witchcraft and that book I've never read
123:33
it but people tell me stuff in it some
123:35
of those acts that they do in those
123:37
books and now this they sell spell kits
123:39
is real witch cloud
123:42
there are even a Harry Potter University
123:44
being built in Richmond Virginia
123:47
and guess how many people Robbie's in
123:49
there because it's a fantasy they think
123:52
and not a fantasy nothing from hell is a
123:57
fantasy amen so there's always there's
124:00
always good stuff to share with you
124:02
powerful stuff to share with you but but
124:04
if you can receive a warning that will
124:06
save you a lot of stuff later in your
124:08
life then just receive it because I do
124:12
know I'm going to see her since there's
124:15
a little girl and I saw operations of
124:16
Hell everywhere I know what they do to
124:19
trick people mark people follow people
124:21
so when you send get marked by the enemy
124:24
then they follow you and try to get you
124:25
to fall again so nothing's being hidden
124:28
there's an unseen world sees you all the
124:30
time okay so live up right right just
124:34
get rid of the junk get rid of it
124:37
it'll be like it was never there enemy
124:39
will have no way to track you or find
124:41
you and he should have nothing to do
124:44
with you no right to do anything to you
124:47
and you can say that too but the good
124:49
news is this we're entering into a time
124:52
where you have to understand the more of
124:55
God the spirit realm around you which
124:57
has always been here I see beings
125:00
operating everywhere all the time even
125:02
here what I've been present in the hotel
125:04
outside the hotel everywhere I go I see
125:06
activities
125:07
I am purpose sometimes we'll say
125:09
something to the demons because they
125:11
don't think you can see them I make sure
125:16
they know who I believe then I ask the
125:18
host to go attack them then they run
125:19
screaming down the street the host is
125:21
just falling behind and whacking them
125:22
with their sword you know crushing them
125:25
and so I reek havoc wherever I go that's
125:30
good and there are kids doing it right
125:32
now
125:32
their children will be raised in this
125:35
time to begin to know we find out about
125:38
the glory we will get to carry the glory
125:41
but our kids will live in the glory and
125:43
their kids will know nothing but the
125:46
glory which is why God needs generations
125:50
on the earth when you start something
125:52
new
125:53
he needs generally
125:54
in order for it to operate so I can say
125:57
if you're young you have a long powerful
126:00
life ahead of you and if you're not
126:03
young asked to be timeless and get ready
126:06
to live longer because you have a
126:07
decision to make for God you don't have
126:10
to be bound by time even now if you
126:13
choose not to so this is a great time to
126:16
be on the earth I think we'll probably
126:17
take one more one more question does he
126:20
have a question oh I want to hear his
126:22
question okay he was curious to know if
126:27
you could describe what heaven looks
126:28
like specifically wondering is it bright
126:30
yellow is it golden but if you could
126:34
maybe describe its characteristics
126:36
landscapes just I I can share Hume in
126:39
this but I've seen so much of it it is
126:42
all light there's no darkness in heaven
126:45
nobody ever sleeps because they never
126:47
get tired they have rainbow bridges they
126:50
have arrogance they can fly on they have
126:53
dinosaurs you can ride on they have
126:55
fountains filled with chocolate and home
126:57
is made out of jell-o you can eat they
127:00
have a fantastic you can go into cartoon
127:02
village and write a cartoon out and then
127:04
you go in and you are it okay this is
127:08
heaven this is really heaven they have
127:10
rodeos they have they have they have
127:13
hunting but you do it with a camera the
127:17
point is this when you hunt the creature
127:19
you're looking for a supernatural
127:20
spiritual being it will get you before
127:23
you ever get it you go back to the
127:26
clubhouse and there's your face
127:28
plastered on a 40-foot screen because
127:31
the creature you're looking for
127:33
got you first they celebrate Christmas
127:36
in heaven everybody will end with this
127:39
one who is it oh the friendly forest
127:44
there is a friendly forest where the
127:46
trees talk and they will sing and dance
127:48
with you even the stones little stones
127:51
pebbles jump up and down with faces and
127:53
they sing glories to God the tree cannot
127:56
brood itself and go to your mansion and
127:58
root itself and be a friend and talking
128:00
to have conversations with you I've seen
128:03
all of us in heaven my
128:04
sister Jen is writing children's books
128:06
that will show a lot of these scenes in
128:09
heaven for children will know the truth
128:10
about heaven and our Lord and the father
128:13
and the angels angels are made out of
128:16
everything they don't all look like us
128:18
probably half of them don't have our
128:21
creatures they're very fierce through
128:23
the army they have weapons coming out of
128:26
them so trust me the army that bur Texas
128:29
is through hell terrifying the glory of
128:33
God is everywhere father sends a wave of
128:36
his rainbow through heaven to look for
128:38
you and bring you back to himself in the
128:40
throne room you never want to leave
128:43
there they celebrate they have
128:45
celebrations in the throne room works
128:47
like a big party
128:48
they like celebrations sometimes worship
128:51
is just jump it up and down and
128:53
screaming you know like they do here on
128:55
this earth that came from heaven it all
128:57
creates glory for god it's worship for
129:00
god angels love to crowd surf at some of
129:02
the concerts they have in heaven there
129:06
are real beings that have personalities
129:08
they care very much for us God made them
129:11
for us that they're not against you amen
129:14
any other questions oh I have to answer
129:23
that one asked he was asking about if
129:25
anybody commits suicide did they go to
129:27
heaven it depends on of us actually
129:28
suicide or not I was caught up by the
129:32
father on purpose I was going to go to
129:34
Penn State and he said I'm gonna have
129:35
you bust a myth that's been around for a
129:38
long time that people cannot take their
129:41
life and go to heaven he said that
129:43
depends on if this suicide or not he
129:45
said go look up the word suicide in the
129:47
dictionary sometimes yes me do it and it
129:49
says someone who willingly knowingly
129:52
intelligently in the right mind decide
129:57
they're going to end their life usually
129:59
is to hurt people like terrorists like
130:01
terrorist bombers they on purpose choose
130:04
to no longer live they do it usually for
130:07
a horrible purpose but what most people
130:09
are doing aren't ending their life
130:12
they're ending their suffering and God
130:15
says I judge
130:17
and then after he said that he took me
130:19
three times to heaven people who had
130:21
ended their suffering but loved Jesus
130:23
Christ they all three were in heaven
130:25
they did not want to stop living they
130:28
loved their families but they saw no
130:30
other escape the pain was so great they
130:32
had some of them one had mental issues
130:34
one had medical issues one had emotional
130:38
issues and and most of the time one of
130:40
it was from medicine that was given them
130:41
to heal them it gave them trauma and
130:44
continual suicidal thoughts flooded them
130:47
and today I can't handle this anymore
130:49
I'm going home to Jesus and they ended
130:52
their suffering and God said I don't
130:53
want everyone thinking their loved ones
130:56
who knew me who believed in me who
130:58
trusted me even if they fell for some
131:02
reason but they never gave me up or quit
131:04
loving me and something happened and
131:07
their life ended they are not in hell he
131:11
said I would be an unjust god if I took
131:13
somebody who loved me and served me and
131:15
they had an accident and something
131:18
happened physically to their head that
131:20
they weren't thinking right all they
131:22
knew was pain and agony and they
131:24
couldn't live they couldn't handle the
131:26
suffering or the thing with the medicine
131:28
that actually happens a lot they even
131:30
have things on bottles that say it could
131:32
give you suicidal thoughts and so God
131:34
said I'm gonna make sure you understand
131:35
this he put despair on me despair is
131:39
what comes right before suicide and you
131:41
begin to have those thoughts he made me
131:43
carry it for a week and tell nobody and
131:47
all I could think in my head it was like
131:50
I was literally experiencing it there
131:52
was no I felt no hope and this is and I
131:55
knew him there was no hope in my mind
131:57
that this would ever end all I could
131:59
think of was I'm getting out of here
132:01
I can't bear to be here this is so great
132:04
I wanted to be taken but he wouldn't
132:06
take it from me he told me first he said
132:09
I will not take it off of you at the end
132:10
of the week I will take it off of you
132:12
and you will never forget what that felt
132:13
like
132:13
and you understand my people cannot take
132:16
the agony or the suffering of that
132:18
bombarding them all the time and it was
132:20
horrible at the end of the week it was
132:22
like it never happened and what huh I'm
132:24
gonna go share that message everywhere
132:26
and after that I went to Pennsylvania
132:27
for the first time and shared that
132:29
message
132:30
and I found out several people in the
132:32
meeting had had loved ones who had done
132:34
that they all ran down front they were
132:35
crying they were hanging on to me and
132:37
there was even a well-known person I
132:40
won't mention their name that their son
132:42
took his life his ended his suffering
132:45
and he had been in an accident a
132:47
well-known person and so this young man
132:51
has served God his whole life he was
132:53
like in his late 20s loved Jesus but all
132:56
he kept saying was I can't handle this
132:58
he'd been an accident they gave him this
133:00
medicine they took him off the medicine
133:02
they had to put him back on the medicine
133:03
and he finally said I can't I'm leaving
133:05
I'm leaving he kept telling I'm leaving
133:07
and then they found him and he was dead
133:09
and God and he was coming to our city to
133:12
speak and God said his wife is hiding
133:15
herself
133:15
the mother is hiding herself because of
133:17
all the believer saying is too bad your
133:20
son is burning in hell the world didn't
133:26
say that the world this is the awful
133:27
part the world said were so sorry for
133:30
your loss you know we want to help
133:32
console' you we want to comfort you this
133:34
is the world but the ones in the body
133:38
were saying
133:39
instantly he was burning in hell so she
133:42
hid she wouldn't come out she wouldn't
133:44
go anywhere she didn't want her face to
133:46
be seen and she was grieving already
133:48
right and God said I'm not tolerating
133:51
this I'm gonna let them know exactly
133:53
what their son is doing he caught me up
133:54
to heaven I saw their son I didn't know
133:57
about them and how was taken to his
133:59
father's managing because this man was
134:01
young and I was taken to his father's
134:03
literally his father's managin being
134:05
built in heaven and it had this great
134:07
mantle it was at the foot of the
134:09
mountain of spices and it was absolutely
134:11
beautiful and that's where he was
134:13
staying at that time and there was a
134:14
trophy on the mantle that said Satan 0
134:18
God 1 and it was he was saying that
134:23
Satan did not get their son then it was
134:26
walked to the management
134:27
I saw siblings that weren't even born
134:30
yet in photographs in this person's
134:33
mansion and then I saw the son another
134:36
time he was packing up a horse he was
134:39
going to go to the mountain of spices to
134:40
go do a hunt and he said I wish my dad
134:43
knew
134:44
there's a new way to shoot animals that
134:46
won't hurt them and he was packing
134:48
camera gear so this is how I found out
134:50
about the hunting and he was going up
134:52
into these woods to go hunting and he
134:54
said man I remember all the fun I had
134:56
with my dad and my brothers one who did
134:57
this
134:58
but it's even better now and so I saw
135:00
these creatures hunting behind the trees
135:02
I'm sure there was some of the ones he
135:04
was going to try to get I saw him stop
135:06
by the clubhouse and register that he
135:08
was going on this hunt so if he if his
135:10
scope got the picture that it would be
135:13
put up there your picture okay is in the
135:16
in the in the corner the one who took
135:18
the picture the one they captured is on
135:21
the screen most of the time the
135:25
creatures here in Europe they're on the
135:27
screen so all that was happening and I
135:29
wrote three pages three days in a row
135:31
God took me to heaven and showed me the
135:33
Sun I was also taken into his mother's
135:35
mansion which was right next door had
135:37
the name of the family over this part
135:39
because they were like I called him like
135:41
like community or family mansions like
135:43
you live in a whole wing of your own
135:45
this wing could be like fifty thousand
135:47
hundred thousand square feet it could be
135:49
half the size of a city because God's
135:52
gracious and so I typed all this up he
135:55
was coming to speak I took it to my
135:56
pastor and said I got this word he read
135:58
it he was crying goes you make sure he
136:00
gets that word they are suffering so
136:02
much he said I'm an agreement with his
136:04
word that hit their son it changed him
136:06
forever it changed his mom came out of
136:09
hiding she was filled with joining the
136:11
celebration the father was weeping to
136:13
know that God cared enough to show that
136:15
his son were his son was I didn't know
136:18
where they lived they lived at the big
136:21
mountains at the bottom of the big
136:23
mountains in Colorado and so he said
136:26
that's why I made their mansions there
136:28
because I knew they would love it and he
136:30
said and and and this person said we
136:33
went hunting I took my son's hunting all
136:34
the time well it wasn't really to kill
136:36
something as much as it was to have the
136:38
experience of being together and then
136:40
all these things I saw was exactly the
136:43
way they lived their life things he said
136:46
himself for his mother
136:47
I saw him wearing plaid like this plaid
136:50
shirt and jeans and that was exactly
136:52
what it was wearing when they found him
136:54
so every over and over again
136:58
I saw things that disconfirmed them that
137:01
their son was in heaven amen so thank
137:17
you thank you

00:16

00:19

00:25

00:27
you hear something that you want to sow
00:28
into and grab it you sow into it
00:32
we want to bless her so much when she
00:34
goes back she's gonna freak out when she
00:36
sees the multiplication that happens
00:38
because she is a prophetess and we want
00:42
to bless the prophetess in her ministry
00:44
so so because she's gonna go and we're
00:47
gonna pass baskets at the end but if you
00:48
have to leave early please make your way
00:50
up here if you don't if that weirds you
00:53
out to come up then give it to one of
00:56
the ushers that are standing in the back
00:58
and they will receive that offering and
01:00
put it in the offering basket for you
01:14
can you turn her up Lisa please
01:29
oh now you can hear me okay
01:38
yeah I can hear now it's just making is
01:45
that making it rain I'm always excited
01:51
to come here because I don't have you
01:54
know boundaries put on me some places
02:04
just afraid of the new and actually it's
02:07
not really new it's just being revealed
02:10
and all through time God has done that
02:14
when it was his time to do something new
02:16
it was revealed in the earth it was
02:19
always his plan we're just finding out
02:22
about it and that's true in every age
02:25
this come on this earth God has done
02:27
something new new things to say new ways
02:31
to live new ways to operate like them
02:35
because the Bible says we're supposed to
02:38
do that right course food who are we
02:41
supposed to be like say Jesus really
02:45
loud does he want us to operate like he
02:49
did then don't be afraid to do it you
02:54
know I'm not afraid of the face of man
02:56
that's not gonna work I've already been
03:00
in his presence I know what his heart is
03:04
I know what the father's plans are for
03:06
the sir it's not time to end it yet
03:11
I tell people stop fighting about the
03:14
time when you want to escape on your
03:16
rapture odd I have news for everybody
03:20
the rapture is not an escape
03:24
it will be a celebration isn't that true
03:31
it's a celebration because an escape
03:36
would be fear and he has nothing to do
03:39
with fear and neither should you there
03:43
should be no fear in you God holds you
03:49
in his hand when he's ready he's taking
03:51
you home nobody can stop that but if he
03:54
want you to stay nobody can stop that
03:56
either you know John could have stayed
04:01
John the Beloved could still be here
04:04
amongst us if he decided to stay because
04:09
Jesus said to the disciples what is it
04:11
you but I love him to remain until they
04:14
come again has he come again yet
04:17
then that means John could be here
04:19
correct how long would that have been so
04:24
if God decides to keep somebody two
04:26
hundred three hundred four hundred five
04:28
hundred years now what is it you I'm
04:33
saying yes by the way I won't even buy a
04:38
life insurance policy my staff walked
04:41
into the phone when people want to sell
04:43
life insurance oh she doesn't want it
04:46
well can we ask her no it won't do any
04:49
good but everybody needs it and they go
04:51
no she's not planning on dying and then
04:55
they hang up
04:59
and we all laughed for that but I'm not
05:01
I have no plans I lay down my life I
05:05
live in him as long as he wants me here
05:07
I'm staying I know John missed what he
05:13
saw he missed it so much he couldn't
05:17
stand to be here anymore
05:19
nobody took his life either nobody
05:25
killed him no disease took his life he
05:30
decided to go how about that it's people
05:36
go oh no you you can't choose with this
05:38
day or not yes I can I can choose that
05:42
it's up to him when I go but I don't
05:49
want to go I'm not missing anything I'm
05:53
not missing anything he's gonna do on
05:55
this earth as long as he wants me to
05:58
here be here I'm staying and one day I
06:03
want you to plan to come here I'm just
06:05
letting you know that I'll just show up
06:08
I walked through the wall I've been here
06:10
on the blackboard in heaven they have no
06:16
time I want to live that way I want to
06:24
be just like them let us make man in our
06:28
image and after all excuse me I've been
06:30
talking so much I don't know where I
06:32
left my water I think it's on the floor
06:35
that's somewhere I'll be sharing about
06:39
this a little bit but I just got back
06:40
from Hollywood and I talked non-stop I
06:44
did make some side meetings so I'm not
06:46
even talking about the meetings I did
06:49
I'm talking about the producer I met
06:52
with
06:53
[Music]
06:56
God is taking Hollywood
06:59
I mean seriously he is taking it and
07:12
he'll is terrified no he'll can get mad
07:20
but the time will come when they get so
07:23
afraid of you you become dangerous
07:29
well I'm dangerous and when I go in
07:34
somewhere in Hollywood they run out they
07:37
won't they won't they can't stand to be
07:39
near me they don't want to be near me
07:40
they will burn like they will literally
07:42
burn and they'll feel the pain I'm of
07:47
sure one day says make them feel the
07:48
pain and on the back will be a devil and
07:52
they'll be going like this I want to
07:58
share a couple things though before I
08:00
actually start because I almost never do
08:02
this but we actually have some new
08:03
things
08:04
we're in Phase two of what God called me
08:06
to do the first whole half not half the
08:10
first season I had in doing this was to
08:12
reveal heaven to earth the second season
08:15
is to create heaven on earth that season
08:19
will be much longer than the first one
08:21
it's still a way to reveal it but why
08:24
not be able to hold it or wear it or sit
08:26
on it or watch or have it in your walls
08:29
or have it in your floors heaven is
08:33
invading literally invading people's
08:35
lives everywhere in ways that we maybe
08:38
not expect one of it is going to be the
08:42
movie industry and so God is making us
08:46
extremely bold about what we say so
08:49
there's no question when you're in that
08:51
arena you need to make sure there's no
08:53
question about who you represent I'm
08:57
gonna make that perfectly clear
09:00
and then the Holy Spirit always gives us
09:02
new little we call them Kingdom quotes
09:04
but they're actually Holy Spirit quotes
09:06
he makes me save him I purpose because
09:08
he likes to hear them and our newest one
09:12
is I don't do demons in case hell should
09:20
wander by we want to make sure they
09:22
remember the day they were kicked out
09:23
with a lightning bolt which is right in
09:25
the middle there you go bring back back
09:28
back to the remembrance in case they
09:31
forgot so this is a car magnet we don't
09:35
do traditional bumper stickers just can
09:36
go on your car and it's huge
09:39
[Laughter]
09:42
it does get looks we just released it
09:45
about a month ago we have buttons that
09:47
you can wear and talk about you want to
09:49
make a conversation just wear one and
09:51
walk somewhere and people love
09:56
especially in our country they love to
09:58
read any kind of a sign or button you're
10:01
wearing or t-shirt or cap that you have
10:03
to see what it says they literally have
10:07
to see it and I've seen people follow
10:09
people down the street so they can
10:10
finally read the bumper sticker so now
10:14
they see this and right along with this
10:18
one we have other ones we have one that
10:20
says roll up your wraps your rug and
10:21
rule
10:29
okay so right there's I don't do demons
10:31
roll up your rapture rug and rule there
10:33
you go what does that mean one of my
10:38
staff said why don't we just say roll up
10:40
your wraps are there every Baptists on
10:42
the earth could be so mad at us they'd
10:44
be thrown things out so we got to say
10:46
why okay why number one it is not time
10:50
for the rapture right now we haven't
10:52
occupied that means take Dominion take
10:57
Dominion deucey do something powerful
11:00
with your life I will I'd I had to read
11:10
an entire movie script in 20 hours
11:15
because I will be editing it thank God
11:22
Margaret was with me and this can be
11:25
powerful not like anything you have seen
11:27
on this earth anywhere not anywhere at
11:35
all and so we also have along with the
11:38
census since this is the Holy Spirit's
11:40
favorite quote right now we also have a
11:43
cup cozies and if I can get it on here I
11:46
might it does if it fits water bottles
11:51
but it also fits cups and then make it
11:53
fit this one now nobody has these yet it
11:58
also says I don't do demons take your
12:01
water bottle to work set it around
12:05
you will stir up things so these are
12:12
brand new and everything we have is made
12:15
in America since I'm going to market
12:20
this okay
12:22
this is sewn on two sides but it lays
12:24
flat for traveling we plan to take
12:27
hundreds of these overseas with us and
12:29
and it says they don't do demons and on
12:32
the back is where you can find out more
12:33
revealing heaven calm and the Holy
12:36
Spirit picks the colors everything he
12:38
wanted to make sure you could see this a
12:40
mile away okay so this is another thing
12:42
we've got right here we we have we have
12:46
gone back because we used to have these
12:48
when I first started we didn't have any
12:50
maintenance so we've had some new ones
12:52
made it does have the book cover on it
12:54
revealing heaven we'll have a book to
12:56
also have one with its colors and when I
12:59
get booked three them will do that this
13:01
is also made in America this opens and
13:03
shuts it does not come off and this
13:06
however you get it off you snap it off
13:09
but look how hard that is this double
13:11
double pane double insulated made in
13:14
America dishwasher safe microwave-safe
13:18
how about that and yeah for hot or cold
13:22
and it works we've tested all of our own
13:24
stuff so I love that we can put maybe
13:27
this is our newest one it literally just
13:29
came out hey we made this thing as big
13:33
as the magnet are you kidding 22 ounces
13:37
I don't do jima
13:40
that's good because this one is yours
13:44
and I love the colors we make sure
13:46
everything matches well you know the
13:48
Holy Spirit doesn't like a lot of
13:49
clutter on things because they want you
13:51
to see what it's sayin right and so this
13:55
is our newest one we literally just got
13:56
them I love them and because we're
13:59
making a statement this is what the Holy
14:00
Spirit said you're making a statement
14:02
about who you are and what you stand for
14:06
without blasting any other denomination
14:09
or religion you're literally can safely
14:15
if you care make a statement about what
14:18
you believe in what you don't tolerate
14:19
and people are sowing dunks they've
14:22
never seen anything like this before you
14:25
know it's either something very liberal
14:27
or demonic or you might have a cross on
14:30
something but God is into saying very
14:33
plainly what he means and this means you
14:37
are not partnering nor tolerating nor
14:40
participating with darkness of any kind
14:42
whatsoever and so people have to say
14:45
well what does that mean well I just
14:47
tell them that means I torment demons
14:49
that's what it means
14:52
and then I quote a scripture you know
14:54
this is what this means this is our
14:56
privilege in this time as the body of
14:59
Christ
14:59
you know God had his time when he kicked
15:01
him out of heaven right when they were
15:04
all became evil and then Jesus had his
15:06
time when he wasted hell on the third
15:08
day and melted the faces of the
15:10
principalities and powers in hell
15:12
stripped their leader of everything took
15:15
every gemstone off that God put on him
15:17
and took the keys of hell death in the
15:19
break so guess who gets the third show
15:24
we do God said oh it's the show he said
15:29
I am a show person all the way I was the
15:31
first show man in the center ring when I
15:34
kicked all those all those demonic
15:36
angels out that they rose up against me
15:38
he said there was light lightning bolt
15:41
there was action they went down
15:46
there was lights and there was action ok
15:48
this is the Sun in hell all darkness you
15:51
know ready for by the way Satan was
15:54
planning a show by the way if you didn't
15:55
know that he was Satan was planning a
15:58
show himself to torture the Son of God
16:00
in front of all of his demons and he
16:02
actually called in the principalities
16:04
and powers because they don't stay in
16:06
Hell they are seated on Thrones on dark
16:10
Thrones all around this world so he
16:13
called them in to hell to the courtyard
16:15
of Hell where he was going to put the
16:17
show on well guess what the Son of God
16:22
put the show on and it says so in the
16:24
Bible he spoiled ruined principalities
16:29
and powers and made a show of it openly
16:33
triumphing in it I call that a show
16:38
there was lights the fire of God coming
16:41
out of his hands there was action the
16:43
melting faces of the principalities and
16:45
there was a lot of noise the demons
16:47
screaming now we get to manifest and
16:50
demonstrate for him in this earth doing
16:52
supernatural signs and wonders the
16:54
greater works stunning hell and shocking
16:57
this world so whether you knew it or not
17:01
you're the 3rd show how about that so we
17:04
like to make things that are you know
17:06
preparing for the show right I'm wearing
17:08
this pin that I wore the first time it
17:11
was in 2016 early in 2016 when the
17:16
elections well the the campaigning was
17:18
going on and it says let the show begin
17:21
and it has begun don't totally begun
17:26
these are these coasters the ones that
17:29
are made out of the pressed whatever
17:31
that is they can get wet and then they
17:34
drown you reuse them reuse them this is
17:36
the weather warriors which we also are
17:39
kind of still in charge of them what are
17:41
the weather warriors we tell the weather
17:43
what it cannot do we're not we're not
17:47
stopping the weather we're stopping the
17:49
destruction of Hell getting in the
17:52
weather when God created weather for
17:56
this earth he did not create it to be
17:58
destructive
17:59
it was a nourish and replenish the earth
18:02
in the winter it was to cover up like
18:04
the earth thrust right and and it does a
18:07
lot of other things like kill the
18:08
insects and the bugs
18:10
unfortunately in Florida we don't get a
18:12
lot of snow we didn't get a lot we don't
18:16
get a lot of that down there but other
18:18
places have it so God designed this
18:21
earth to operate in a certain way but
18:24
since there's a wicked evil being who
18:26
hates everyone and including the earth
18:29
here he has tried to take over himself
18:32
and yet the Bible clearly says Jesus
18:35
gave us power this is not my message yet
18:37
this is my introduction the word clearly
18:41
says that Jesus said to all believers I
18:45
give you power over the power of the
18:53
enemy so this is using that power right
18:59
here God did did not design hurricanes
19:02
himself Satan gets involved in that and
19:06
gets controlling them he wants to kill
19:09
steal and destroy and he will use that
19:11
in any form of whether he can while
19:15
we're stopping it yes we have a right
19:19
because Jesus said we were joint heirs
19:21
what he did we can do he stopped to
19:26
storm people we actually do that and
19:30
there's a whole lot of people we now
19:32
call them the weather warrior so God had
19:33
us design a logo God is into images
19:36
trust me this is another logo almost
19:39
everything we have it's either a logo or
19:42
it's the beginning of a move of God
19:45
because I don't get to do anything
19:47
that's normal okay
19:48
I'm never gonna be normal
19:52
not ever another thing we have the right
19:56
to do is to command the host of heaven
20:01
some of you may have a problem with this
20:05
don't be concerned about commanding the
20:08
host of heaven that would be the army of
20:11
heaven and and God loves that army he
20:15
designed them to war for us they are not
20:20
protecting heaven
20:22
they never have protected heaven they
20:25
don't need to protect heaven the one who
20:27
made them is on the throne so they've
20:31
never stopped people from coming up into
20:32
heaven and taking things okay although
20:35
somebody translated that word you know
20:38
about the kingdom of heaven suffering
20:40
violence they think that means that
20:41
people from earth are going up there and
20:44
stealing things that literally came out
20:48
of a Bible translation it really did I
20:53
don't know how they got that I don't
20:56
know where that even came from okay that
21:01
scripture has a revelation to it the
21:05
scripture is from the time of John the
21:06
Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven
21:09
suffers violence and the violent take it
21:12
by force is that correct is that what
21:14
that scripture says well everybody's
21:17
focusing on the word suffers because
21:19
they don't understand although
21:20
scripturally there is another meaning
21:22
for that and the Holy Spirit showed me
21:25
think of this scripture suffer the
21:29
little children to come unto me now does
21:33
that mean the little children are being
21:34
attacked say no does that mean that he's
21:40
saying cause the little children to come
21:42
unto me encourage the little children to
21:45
come unto me so let's put that word in
21:47
the other scripture from the time of
21:50
John the Baptist until now the Kingdom
21:52
of Heaven encourages and causes
21:54
spiritual violence to rise up on the
21:57
inside of you so you the believer can
22:00
take it by force
22:01
from the enemy now that scripture makes
22:08
sense doesn't it because it does not
22:11
mean the other thing there's literally
22:14
no way anyone's gonna get up to heaven
22:17
without God's permission amen they want
22:22
us to be spiritually violent that word
22:26
is that means passionately violent
22:29
against the spiritual darkness don't
22:32
tolerate them don't participate with
22:35
them and there's another scripture that
22:37
clearly says that our weapons of warfare
22:41
are not natural they are not physical
22:45
but they are spiritual they say the word
22:48
day they are supernatural and spiritual
22:52
weapons and they pull down what what
22:57
kind of strongholds are they pulling
22:59
down they pull down principalities right
23:01
and strongholds of darkness is that
23:04
right that sounds like an army to me an
23:10
army we've almost been totally ignoring
23:13
for a very long time and yet they were
23:16
created by God for us to be over angels
23:20
are not over us it says in the times to
23:25
come we will judge them does that say
23:27
that the Bible so if we're going to
23:31
judge them then they can't be over us is
23:33
that correct we have some authority over
23:36
them we cannot worship them but
23:40
commanding if you look in the dictionary
23:42
if you look at the word commanding it
23:44
does not mean worship it does not mean
23:48
we're worshipping but I happen to known
23:51
the military must have orders I've had
23:56
so many members of my family in the
23:57
military including my husband was in the
24:00
Marine Corps they cannot work on their
24:03
own can you imagine them running out of
24:06
boot camp taking weapons they barely not
24:08
go in attacking things does that happen
24:11
do they have to have orders from
24:14
headquarters even when they're overseas
24:17
they have somebody over them that has to
24:20
give them orders heavens army is no
24:23
different I have news to me even though
24:27
there's an army that army cannot leave
24:30
their bitters in heaven attack whoever
24:32
they feel like that's not going to
24:35
happen they have to have orders they
24:38
operate by orders they harpin under the
24:40
word of the lord so that means you're
24:42
not going to move this army unless he
24:45
lives in you and he operates through you
24:49
they're gonna listen to anybody else but
24:54
there had to come a time on this earth
24:56
in order for them to fulfill their
24:58
destiny that we could send them on
25:00
missions ourselves are we joint heirs
25:05
with Christ was he the Lord of Hosts did
25:09
he command heavens army is that our
25:11
right then why aren't we doing it well I
25:15
know you are now but every time I
25:20
introduce the army of heaven I always
25:23
have to go through this preparation for
25:25
people that never considered in their
25:27
head they know what praying to Jesus
25:30
they ask Jesus to send help but if we're
25:35
like them and they create we can create
25:40
if they come in weak in command is that
25:43
right it is always his power that does
25:48
it
25:48
we don't do anything without Christ we
25:51
don't get anything we can't have
25:53
anything we can't just choose to do
25:55
stuff on our own even in the same way we
25:58
don't operate without Christ that army
26:01
cannot operate without commanders back
26:06
in 2014 I was shown millions of the army
26:11
of heaven being sent to this earth and
26:14
they were waiting 2014 the father
26:20
introduced me to the army of heaven and
26:22
taught me how to command them
26:25
from that day I have not ever been
26:28
attacked
26:29
I am never sick they were made to keep
26:38
us and protect us in all our ways the
26:43
Angels we have with us all the time
26:44
they're sent at the time of our
26:46
conception at the time we are conceived
26:49
they are sent I see them all the time
26:52
waiting outside pregnant mothers those
26:56
angels I know where hers are those
26:59
angels that are waiting you're waiting
27:00
for that baby to be born that's when you
27:04
have guardian angels they don't just
27:07
come to you and get a certain age
27:08
they're there with you your entire life
27:11
they have already got their orders from
27:15
the Father they know boundaries that
27:18
they have they know what they were sent
27:20
there for the army has another purpose
27:25
they are sent to attack and destroy the
27:28
plans of the dark armies Satan has an
27:32
army too it's not as big it's not as
27:35
well organized it does not love each
27:37
other they hate each other they kind of
27:42
do what they wanted they get punished a
27:43
lot but God's army cares about each
27:46
other they work well together they are
27:51
fierce against the darkness they don't
27:54
ever abandon their post they're very
27:57
destructive they operate in the spirit
28:00
realm wherever you send them wherever
28:03
there is darkness whether it was evil
28:05
wherever there is violence you can send
28:08
them there this earth is going to change
28:11
drastically when the body of Christ
28:14
finally stops fighting it arguing with
28:16
it not wanting to do anything with it
28:19
because they're afraid their lives are
28:22
going to change especially in this time
28:26
on the earth when God is boldly gonna
28:29
have a step forth and start doing things
28:31
okay and going places where they never
28:33
wanted to go before you send the army
28:35
before you
28:37
all the strongholds are pulled down and
28:40
we just had friends that just witnessed
28:43
that I kept telling them they go on
28:45
these missions trips all over Korea and
28:47
the last time all the reporter was how
28:49
many times they got attacked how many
28:51
people were put in hospitals the own
28:52
people in the hospital how many places
28:54
they got rejected in places already
28:56
agreed to have them come and I said when
28:58
they were done but you did send the army
29:00
right
29:02
we forgot so when they went this year
29:07
they sent me a text we have sent our
29:11
army every one of us we are given them
29:14
very specific detailed orders and every
29:17
place we go they'll go there first
29:19
they'll be there while we're there we
29:21
don't expect a no holdups delays
29:23
incidents accident sicknesses nothing of
29:26
any kind happen every time they went to
29:28
I forgot how many like 2030 cities they
29:30
went to Korea I got a report every time
29:32
every single time they were going to
29:34
know that they know they sent the army
29:36
not one incident not in their travel not
29:42
in their protection not in the places
29:44
they stayed in not the cities they went
29:46
to there were so many miracles and souls
29:49
one and the joy of it all they had any
29:53
interference from the devil not one not
29:58
one not one they want me to come back
30:01
right away
30:03
so that I can again teach and train
30:07
their entire congregation how to command
30:10
their own army from heaven that will
30:12
live over your home in the sky they do
30:17
not go back to heaven they are assigned
30:19
by heaven to you people walk down my
30:23
street look over my home all the time
30:25
they can see beings there all the time
30:27
don't look for somebody that looks like
30:30
you those are Gabriel's group Gabriel's
30:35
group look like humans except they have
30:38
wings sometimes they hide them there on
30:39
a Centon assignment on the earth could
30:41
get easily move around amongst us the
30:44
hosts of heaven would not be able to do
30:47
that someone have six-inch
30:50
years coming out of every pore of their
30:51
being some are the weapon themselves
30:54
they have 18 eyes okay they're made out
30:57
of every kind of form of substance you
30:59
can think of they could not easily move
31:01
amongst us people would call them aliens
31:05
and probably have in the past they're
31:08
creatures almost every one of them are
31:10
creatures creatures are in heaven
31:13
they're ones that look like what we call
31:15
part human part animal the living
31:19
creatures don't get freaked out I'll
31:21
give you proof the living creatures
31:23
around the throne do not look like
31:25
humans they have massive heads that are
31:29
curved like this I know when people say
31:32
they've seen them because that's what
31:34
their heads are shaped like the one like
31:36
a lion the one like an eagle the one
31:39
like an ox the one that has the face of
31:41
a man does not look like Jesus Christ
31:43
because you have wonder they have eyes
31:45
in their heads in the back of their
31:47
heads and every one of their six wings
31:49
they have hooves golden hooves for their
31:52
feet they walk upright they have these
31:54
gossamer gowns on that make a
31:57
frequencies and they're about 80 to 100
32:03
foot tall every one of them are fierce
32:10
don't go up to heaven try to make
32:11
friends with them and the two that hold
32:17
up the arms of the throne are even more
32:19
weird
32:20
they each have four heads they would not
32:23
easily mix with people on the earth God
32:29
has planned every design of every being
32:34
he has ever made including you
32:38
he knew what your face would look like
32:40
before he made you before you were on
32:43
the earth you got your body in heaven
32:46
you were a little spiritual being some
32:48
different sizes about this biggest
32:50
different sizes you are made out of
32:53
light you lived in him you moved in and
32:56
out of him on the Rays of his rainbow
32:59
that was the only place they could go
33:01
move in and out
33:02
they played inside
33:03
they played in the River of Life that's
33:05
where you were that's where you came
33:07
from that's why he is your father that's
33:12
why you are his sons and daughters you
33:14
are says you are his offspring so anyone
33:17
reunion if you have children let me see
33:19
your hands are your children your
33:22
offspring did the mother carry those
33:27
offspring yes
33:29
so she nurtured them right she carried
33:31
them she had water in her womb so they
33:35
would feel like it was a familiar place
33:38
because inside the father is the river
33:40
of life we played in it we moved in it
33:44
that's where you lived you lived in the
33:47
river of life you played on the stones
33:49
of fire that's why we like sparkly
33:52
things the stone sapphire huge gemstones
33:55
inside the father you've jumped on them
33:59
you played on them you slid down this
34:02
mountain this powerful mountain that is
34:05
inside the father you'd slide down the
34:09
river of life you jump off the gem
34:12
stones into the river of life and that's
34:14
where you played so when you made the
34:16
womb of a woman he put water in it so
34:20
while you were growing inside you
34:23
wouldn't be afraid
34:29
we couldn't leave his presence and live
34:32
somewhere in heaven you have not lived
34:34
on the earth before some people believe
34:37
all kinds of crazy things you didn't
34:40
come to the earth until he sent you here
34:42
he knit you together in your mother's
34:43
womb when he took that little spirit of
34:45
life from himself sent it by the Holy
34:47
Spirit at the time of conception he knit
34:49
it and attached it to that dot of flesh
34:52
that is when life begins he sent you
34:56
from himself he made this whole earth
34:59
this physical realm just so he could
35:02
send you here and you could have a body
35:06
that's how well he plans he knows every
35:10
day of your life he planned good things
35:13
for you not the bad there's the evil
35:16
being here named Satan some people think
35:19
even he does not excuse me I've been to
35:22
hell and I've seen him he hates
35:25
everybody but himself his plan is to
35:28
wipe you out every way he can anytime
35:30
you can and right now powerful powerful
35:35
children are being sent to this earth
35:38
for the years that are starting on this
35:40
earth some of the greatest leaders in
35:44
the body of Christ they're still being
35:46
born he needed him here now so he timed
35:51
your birth on the earth you are
35:57
wonderfully and perfectly made you carry
36:00
parts of his image outside and inside
36:03
how did I get all this information
36:05
because I've been caught up to heaven
36:08
non-stop since 1996 I didn't ask for
36:13
that I don't I don't know how to tell
36:16
you to get that Commission I was given
36:18
the Commission
36:19
I don't decide when I go how long I Stay
36:22
I don't decide what I go see he does I
36:27
come from many generations of believers
36:32
who were sold out in love with Jesus
36:35
Christ many of them had encounters with
36:37
him but even the ones that didn't he
36:40
never step back
36:42
and they went forward in their life they
36:44
touch this earth impacted this earth
36:46
with their life never stopped loving God
36:49
never stopped trusting him never ever
36:51
ever ever
36:52
I'm seventh generation I should be
36:58
different I was not raised normally like
37:03
a lot of people were I knew who God was
37:06
from the time I could before I could
37:08
walk I remember even laying in his hand
37:13
when he was sitting on the throne he was
37:15
talking to me I was about this big like
37:17
this like a little like I was and even
37:21
at that time this I know they say you
37:23
know the sex of the child was determined
37:26
in certain ways down here but let me
37:27
tell you he wrote on your soul what you
37:29
would be because he determined who he
37:33
needed you to be male or female there is
37:37
no other choice on your will on your
37:43
will your will which is one of those
37:47
powerful things you have I'm still not
37:48
starting yet who here does not know but
37:54
human soul looks like we see your hands
37:57
if you don't know literally how it's
37:58
made you know what your mind your will
38:02
and your emotions but do you know what
38:04
those things look like he showed me back
38:10
in 2010 he showed me I have a
38:12
photographic memory which comes in
38:15
really handy with what I do
38:17
cuz I've remembered every single time my
38:19
mistake in heaven he showed me the human
38:22
soul because he's gonna release
38:24
something that would change the body of
38:26
Christ forever and that's exactly what
38:27
he said to me when they learn how to
38:30
really guard their soul they can cause
38:34
it to prosper their self when they get
38:37
their soul to prosper they will always
38:39
prosper and they will live in divine
38:42
health so I am never sick because I
38:47
order my soul accordingly I let no
38:50
darkness in
38:52
I don't watch anything that belongs I
38:54
don't read it I don't watch it and I
38:56
don't say it and I don't listen to it
38:59
either
38:59
it says guard your heart that is your
39:02
soul you know the heart the word heart
39:05
means something more than this thing is
39:06
it on this side I forget this beating
39:10
thing is not what he's talking about
39:12
guard your heart is not about this heart
39:15
it's this one the very core of your
39:18
being in your spirit man is where your
39:20
soul is guard that fraud will flow the
39:25
way you live your life the issues of
39:29
life for out of this soul that you have
39:32
inside you will determine how you live
39:36
your life as a man thinketh in his soul
39:40
so is he so if you don't like you you
39:44
can change it if you don't like things
39:47
happening to you you can change that too
39:49
if you don't like the atmosphere in your
39:51
home you can change that too according
39:55
to what you say what you think how you
39:58
order your life can change your life
40:02
when Adam was laying there not alive and
40:06
God blew the Father the word was with
40:10
him the word was always with him when
40:13
they created that's why you can say
40:15
talking of the word there's nothing that
40:19
was made that was not made by him well
40:22
how come the father was there they
40:23
worked together all the time
40:28
God spoke it the word made it that's how
40:32
it works
40:32
whenever the father said the word that's
40:36
why it was his name would make it they
40:40
were always together so they were
40:42
together in the garden the word made
40:45
Adam but he was missing something he
40:48
wasn't alive he needed his spirit his
40:53
little spirit man that had lived in God
40:54
all that time kept him knew who he would
40:58
become he leaned over and breathed that
41:02
little spirit man these
41:04
fear of life from inside himself or he
41:07
had been living into Adams nostrils and
41:10
then he said Adam has become a living
41:13
soul that's very important that was now
41:19
saying because we had souls wanted
41:21
living in God we just didn't really need
41:22
them because your soul you decide where
41:25
you're gonna live what you're gonna say
41:27
what you're gonna wear what you're gonna
41:28
eat we didn't have to decide any of that
41:30
when we lived him he was our home
41:32
he was our very existence so he gave us
41:35
something to wear right he nurtured us
41:38
he's called the many breasted one he
41:40
took care of us the whole time we were
41:43
with him it says that in the Bible that
41:44
just meant that he would comfort us he
41:46
would hold us he would love us it does
41:49
say that in the Bible depending on
41:51
translation you get some of the newer
41:53
ones I don't know what for if it says
41:55
that or not but it does say that about
41:58
him no matter how your father your
42:01
physical one treated you on this earth
42:04
he is your real father so your soul is
42:11
very key to your very existence most of
42:14
the time I grew up in church think I was
42:16
born there practically we went every
42:18
meeting we had in the churches that we
42:20
attended and and I learned a lot I
42:23
listened a lot I learned a lot but they
42:26
never really told me what my soul was
42:28
for except that it was not good
42:33
almost every statement made it's dark
42:35
man designs and desires bad things and
42:39
things and bad things and well maybe if
42:41
they choose that they do you know to a
42:43
five-year-old don't know how darker
42:45
could be and I would sit there on that
42:47
pew and this is what I would think how
42:49
could they say that I meet from God I'm
42:54
light I carry light how can my soul be
42:57
bad they just don't know something they
43:01
just don't know this is at five I would
43:05
think about those things my soul has to
43:07
be good Jesus lives in it cuz I got born
43:10
again 84 well no my souls not bad my
43:15
cell no I think on the things of God No
43:18
mine is not we need to find out why our
43:20
solace for it's got to be important he
43:23
didn't make spare parts and if they say
43:27
it's my mind my will and my emotions
43:28
that pretty much I could do nothing
43:29
without it so he decided to literally
43:33
show me and in 2010 he caught me up to
43:35
heaven show me this is a human soul and
43:38
the very core of your being is your will
43:41
it looks like a column it is a column
43:44
it's a strong column with writings on it
43:47
that God Himself wrote on before he sent
43:51
you here he wrote things on it
43:53
no man can literally say and mean it
43:55
that there is no God they lie or they
43:59
don't know but they cannot say that or
44:01
even really convince yourself even
44:03
atheists when they get saved say I
44:05
always knew there was something he wrote
44:07
on your will and then attached to that
44:12
will is your mind not your human brain
44:16
your human brain is just kind of wrapped
44:18
around that mind because when you die
44:20
you still think when you step out of
44:23
that physical body and you're in your
44:24
spirit body
44:25
you think you have emotions you make
44:28
choices
44:29
you'd be pretty bored in heaven if you
44:31
couldn't your soul goes with you your
44:35
body gets separated your soul stays with
44:36
your spirit man you have your favorite
44:39
places in heaven you have your favorite
44:40
foods in heaven so that soul stays with
44:44
you all the time it just fed all day
44:48
long your physical body gets fed three
44:51
times day unless you like to snack a lot
44:54
in foreign countries eat twice a day
44:56
America its three times with dessert and
45:00
snacks but your spirit man your soul is
45:08
sped all day long and if you play stuff
45:12
at night it's fed at night what are you
45:16
feeding you everything you see
45:18
everything you hear everything you read
45:22
and what you say yourself you feed other
45:27
people's souls when you say certain
45:29
things your
45:31
into them I'm I'm feeding you
45:32
everybody's soul right now your soul is
45:34
taking it in you have layers in your
45:37
soul it gets stored in there if there's
45:40
ever anything you really forgot you need
45:42
to remember just tell God that I need my
45:44
soul I need to know from the files of my
45:46
soul I need that I need that I said it
45:49
till one time and in front of me sitting
45:52
in my desk I needed a little scrap of
45:53
paper pastor had written his name and
45:55
phone number down he was gonna invite me
45:57
to come and I lost it but I looked at it
46:00
first I had read it looked at it read I
46:02
knew the same shape and size of that
46:04
piece of paper and it was stored in my
46:06
soul this was like 2 years later when I
46:08
can't find it I need it I know they want
46:11
me to comment on one thing I'm ignoring
46:12
them and when I said ok see my soul show
46:14
it to me in front of me came this piece
46:18
of paper out in the spirit it literally
46:23
it literally just like this came out
46:25
like this and I could see it it was the
46:27
same piece of paper I had looked at
46:29
because it's stored in you and he said
46:34
write it down cleric it's gonna go back
46:36
in there so get my pen I am writing as
46:39
fast as I can I was so excited it didn't
46:42
go like this flip flip now that is
46:49
wonderful if it's something good but if
46:54
you have horrible traumas that is also
46:57
stored in your soul people get tormented
47:00
for years about the things they had to
47:02
witness or see it wasn't even anything
47:03
they had to do with you don't have to
47:05
keep it anything in your soul you don't
47:09
want you loose it with the keys to the
47:11
community you know what that says write
47:17
the keys of the kingdom what you loose
47:20
on earth does that mean you're going to
47:22
keep it if you loose it nope and we
47:25
always thought the keys at the kingdom
47:26
wants to bind the devil they do a lot of
47:30
things actually but what I was taught
47:32
for the father that day was how to get
47:34
stuff out of your soul whether it was
47:37
addictions any kind of addiction trauma
47:40
violent acts words that were said
47:43
that you don't wanna remember those
47:44
words they hurt they wound wounds out of
47:47
your soul it doesn't matter what it is
47:49
witchcraft practice against you it's
47:51
gone gone gone angry hateful words
47:54
offense and forgetting us gone God said
47:57
I don't have six months for people I
48:00
don't have six months for them to be
48:03
healed anymore
48:05
you can lose spirits of infirmity
48:07
sickness and disease from your soul and
48:12
it's gone and I just happened to glance
48:18
in my clock and then he caught me up to
48:19
heaven
48:20
and he showed me the human soul then he
48:22
started telling me one thing after
48:23
another for another they can lose Cistus
48:25
this assists this this this all this
48:27
stuff all this stuff all this stuff they
48:29
can choose to loose it and it we can't
48:31
take it out remember it's loosed from
48:36
heaven then you bind the things of God
48:39
to your soul and this really changes how
48:42
you live you think and you act you can
48:46
actually say and now I choose with my
48:49
will to bind to my soul the life of God
48:52
the love of God the presence of God the
48:54
plans and purposes of God from my life
48:57
his creativity his celebration his
49:00
expectation you get so filled with God
49:06
and no one can take it out it's part of
49:14
that abundant life and it doesn't matter
49:17
how old you are it doesn't matter how
49:19
long ago you experienced things you can
49:24
even lose things from your children
49:26
Souls if they're not adults yet we've
49:29
already had testimonies there's people
49:31
being in the congregations you lay your
49:33
hand on their head as the covering of
49:36
their soul I chooses my will to lose
49:39
from my child so every bit of the
49:40
bullying that they Oaks means all the
49:42
hateful mean disgusting vile
49:46
critical words spoken over my child I
49:49
choose to lose them from their soul
49:51
right now
49:52
haven't come down pulls them out it's
49:54
like it never happened and kids go on
49:59
happy like it never happened
50:01
instead of being affected sometimes for
50:04
a very long time like if you try out for
50:08
something and you reject it sometimes it
50:10
hurts children just loose it
50:11
we have kids are doing on their own we
50:15
have 10 year olds that command armies up
50:17
from heaven because they didn't argue
50:20
about doing it those 10 year olds are
50:23
certainly not worshiping their
50:26
commanding what do they do
50:29
they command them to go to their school
50:30
and protect every student there to stop
50:33
all violence from coming into their zoo
50:35
to pull down strongholds of Satan rising
50:37
against the school too potent on
50:38
strongholds trying to convince them that
50:40
there's something different than they
50:42
are you choose that's why he gave you a
50:52
will that's why he will not control
50:55
people
50:56
Satan controls he'll be happy to take
51:00
your will and do whatever he wants to
51:03
with it and if you put enough of him in
51:05
it you're gonna act like him is that
51:07
right you choose with yourself who are
51:11
you going to serve you choose each day
51:14
am I going to choose life or death
51:16
there's a lot of that going on in this
51:17
election and a lot of people are
51:21
choosing death that's not God God wants
51:28
us to live and live more abundantly amen
51:30
tomorrow night I'll be talking about
51:32
America and Trump 2020
51:35
[Music]
51:35
[Applause]
51:37
but God has told me I think he knows
51:42
amen he on purpose has chosen America to
51:50
be a pattern that even other government
51:54
leaders of other countries can choose to
51:56
pattern their ways after America I
52:01
remember I travel a whole lot in 2017
52:05
and I would meet up people from all over
52:07
the world I never knew never met them
52:09
they'd all come up to me and say you
52:10
must be an American you have pink hair
52:13
we don't have that here but we want to
52:17
know what do you think about your
52:18
president because what we've been
52:20
hearing on the news we cannot possibly
52:22
believe it could be true but he's
52:25
already visited our country and
52:27
encouraged our leaders we already know
52:29
that business is booming in America we
52:32
know he's creating jobs for that country
52:34
we hope our leader becomes just like him
52:38
but we want to know what do you think I
52:40
said well I think 80% of America loves
52:42
him that's why they voted him in and by
52:45
the way stop watching CNN
52:47
I think the fake news doesn't like us
52:51
either and I'd have these long
52:57
discussions with these people never knew
52:58
and these were like medical doctors I
53:00
mean really leaders in their own
53:03
community and it probably did from eight
53:05
different countries and they all asked
53:08
me the same thing and they got the same
53:11
answer so God still has big plans for
53:16
America you think he's wrapping things
53:17
up in ten years I don't think so we are
53:20
just learning to operate and levels of
53:25
authority that were given to us by Jesus
53:27
Christ we're just learning to really
53:30
take authority over the weather because
53:32
we're over it not under it if we're just
53:37
learning this why would you wrap
53:38
everything up this is what God says I
53:42
will not have a weak pathetic testimony
53:45
of my son's death
53:49
and all he gave you I'm not taking
53:51
anybody anywhere until they're operating
53:54
like him so why do we do all this
54:00
everything we do we do because of him we
54:05
do it with him because of him and for
54:08
him we're light in this world so if you
54:12
wonder who to vote for someone who
54:14
doesn't represent the darkness that does
54:16
not represent death that cares about
54:19
what's going on in this world or
54:22
especially their country and God
54:25
certainly cares about it he cares about
54:27
everyone but but we were willing the
54:32
body of Christ is willing to help God is
54:35
that right they worshiped him they loved
54:38
him they honor him what he wants they're
54:41
willing to do the majority are willing
54:43
they just don't know what to do some of
54:44
them and since before pastors weren't
54:48
allowed to give any help now they are of
54:51
course you did design the Internet that
54:54
bypasses everything so God has great
55:00
plans and the next thing I'm going to
55:03
show you is really the first time on
55:05
planet Earth this has ever been done and
55:09
the father said I'm going to ask you to
55:10
do something I want it done right away
55:11
he said I'm going to mark the year that
55:15
I released for the first time the faces
55:18
of the hosts of heaven to humanity he
55:23
said I want you to put them in a
55:24
calendar you're gonna call it the hosts
55:26
undercover he said they'd better
55:30
undercover for a long time but now they
55:32
won't be because he's serious about
55:35
crushing hell he does have he has a
55:38
defined time when time will be no more
55:41
if you want to know what that means I
55:42
can tell you that means there'll be no
55:45
more time to count days and there were
55:49
no limit to space like in heaven there
55:52
can be 10 things right here there's
55:55
layers in heaven so the comet on many
55:59
earths when time will be no more he will
56:01
not need this physical
56:03
and even when that happens it won't be a
56:06
date it will be an event because God
56:08
counts things by events the time just
56:12
happens to fall in every time he does
56:15
something he does it because of an event
56:18
so on his timeline he measures his
56:20
timeline by events that's how he does it
56:25
so there'll be a certain event at one
56:27
point when that happens he won't need
56:29
this earth anymore there will be a new
56:32
earth made the Bible talks about it some
56:34
people don't want to even admit that day
56:36
I don't know what this thing is are
56:37
afraid to leave it I guess seriously
56:41
there are whole groups now saying there
56:43
is we'll just be remade or keeping it I
56:45
don't think that's scriptural there
56:49
isn't any
56:51
they just think he's gonna make it all
56:53
better
56:54
it wouldn't be able to hold what he's
56:57
got playing for us in the new earth
56:59
you couldn't have put it the new earth
57:03
will be so huge the very fact that the
57:07
New Jerusalem will sit on that the earth
57:08
this earth would go whoop just put this
57:12
in just with the New Jerusalem honor
57:13
okay what's that that's God's transport
57:16
down to the new work that's what it is
57:18
he's packing up leaving his own home
57:22
he's always had leaving heaven one day
57:25
because we will stay in his home for a
57:28
temporary time when you die and move to
57:31
heaven that your RNR you get a beautiful
57:34
mansion you get to do things you never
57:36
thought of before it's R&R for that
57:38
place because God intends fully at one
57:42
time when time as know where he's gonna
57:45
take all of us and it by belonging to
57:47
him that we are his put us on a brand
57:49
new earth and he will pack up his bags
57:51
get on the New Jerusalem and it will be
57:53
his transport we will be down here
57:55
waiting on the new earth for him we will
57:57
see him coming these are real things
58:02
that are talked about in the Word of God
58:04
but people are so stuck where they're at
58:07
they don't know how much further they
58:08
can go so they don't really know where
58:10
they are so they go to what they know
58:13
they all talk about the tribulation they
58:15
talk about the Rabb
58:16
they don't know they talk about doom and
58:18
gloom because you know the tribulation
58:20
is doom and gloom right heaven isn't
58:25
heaven doesn't give you a funeral
58:28
somebody please have a party when their
58:30
loved ones go home because that's what
58:33
they're having in heaven they don't get
58:36
a funeral in heaven they get a party
58:38
it's called a celebration the Bible says
58:42
he celebrates every time one comes home
58:44
that is a celebration that's a lot
58:47
different than the funeral it's a
58:51
funeral would fun after you end so I'm
58:57
going to show you this we have some back
58:59
there I don't know how many we have but
59:01
we're going to give this one to Dave and
59:02
Dee Dee so they'll make sure they get
59:04
one he had us create this it was
59:06
definitely a supernatural thing because
59:08
I have about 400 pictures of the hosts
59:12
he actually sent them to me to get
59:14
pictures of them it if there were a lot
59:16
of them I took pictures if this is the
59:18
thing if you didn't want them shown they
59:20
they collapsed the picture did it was
59:23
like no definition that's just a flat
59:26
nothing and I began I said well what's
59:29
wrong with this one he said no I don't
59:31
want you to keep that one I'll get
59:32
another one so perfectly sharp and clear
59:34
he said you're gonna keep that one I
59:35
didn't know it was keeping them to make
59:37
this calendar we're gonna put them on a
59:39
lot of other things cuz they will
59:40
inspire you and empower you to know
59:42
these guys are real and their greatest
59:47
passion is to war against the darkness
59:50
they didn't cry when Lucifer was kicked
59:52
out the day Michael cried Gabriel
59:58
Michael didn't try they had a party
60:00
because they were fed up with Lucifer
60:03
going around tempting their own friends
60:06
to fall picture in your town and how did
60:13
God deal with evil he kicked it out he
60:16
didn't tolerate it he didn't make a
60:19
place for it he didn't say it's okay
60:24
you're different he kicked it out he
60:27
didn't want it there he didn't want to
60:29
filing heaven anymore it will never be
60:32
allowed back he is not going to forgive
60:35
Satan and he is not going to forgive one
60:39
fallen angel they live with him they got
60:43
one chance it's up soz about these guys
60:49
in the unit on the front cover is a
60:52
being I know I didn't not like this one
60:54
on purpose sometimes we outlined them to
60:56
help you in the corner we would show a
60:59
being like this one then down here we
61:01
just outlined it in case you couldn't
61:03
tell because spiritual beings are made
61:06
different the army especially they don't
61:08
have a hand like this all of them don't
61:10
some have a head they have more than one
61:11
eye or they have one big eye
61:13
guess what else I cops thing came from
61:17
the enemy will take anything you can
61:19
that balloons of God and twist it and
61:21
defile it he will now Medusa that was
61:24
his own creation but there's a lot of
61:29
beings in heaven there's many beings
61:32
that have like a horse body and
61:34
beautiful you know there's them is very
61:36
beautiful they're not evil Satan took
61:40
the image and made it evil so I'm gonna
61:42
show you a couple of the pages now this
61:44
one's very easily seen this is a real
61:46
fire angel made out of guess what fire
61:49
and he's a spirit she she's all
61:52
spiritual being his arms don't come from
61:56
his shoulders they come from his chest
61:59
this is his arm this is his whole arm
62:02
coming out of his body this is his head
62:04
if you could look at this closer you
62:06
could see his eyes his nose his mouth
62:08
this is his wings right here his hair
62:10
his wings he is walking on legs do you
62:14
see the legs he's walking on the river
62:17
in our city and in his hand he's
62:20
carrying a deposit of the fire of God
62:22
his name is Inferno and gentes picture
62:27
it was right after our National Day of
62:30
Prayer and all the wild intercessors got
62:33
on a riverboat we wrote up a nun our st.
62:35
Johns River and we would drop salt in
62:37
the water salting it and we said on
62:39
purpose this is to make way
62:42
to cleanse the water for the fire of God
62:44
to come and then God sent it so about a
62:48
month later after that event he showed
62:51
up on the river we were going over to
62:53
visit my sister on the other side of the
62:55
river and he said don't go the way you
62:57
normally go go this other way or you're
62:59
gonna miss what I'm gonna send in the
63:00
sky she's a photographer I'm driving I
63:04
have to say Jen took this picture I took
63:07
a lot of them but she did take this one
63:08
and we were we are miles dropped off
63:10
when we came over we were on the Express
63:12
system we came over this part down under
63:15
where this is this bridge is three miles
63:17
long as a three mile long bridge that
63:20
connects to the other side of our city
63:22
he was walking on the water not not
63:25
standing he was we got about eight
63:29
pictures of him and he was kind of white
63:30
then he started getting more and more
63:32
fire in him and people were going crazy
63:35
they were pulling over I mean many
63:36
pictures got this people got this
63:38
picture so this is this was one of not
63:40
the very first one but one of the best
63:42
that was in 2009 and so I'll show you
63:46
another one we'll have them back there
63:51
now these are all army members these are
63:53
not any of gabriel's I don't have any
63:56
pictures of Gabriel's I've drawn them I
63:58
painted them I don't have any pictures
64:00
god I'm purpose connecting me to the
64:02
army and so I'll show you another one
64:05
just kind of passing around here some of
64:07
them if you ever see something the sky
64:09
looks like a dragon it's an Eragon they
64:11
belong to heaven if God told me their
64:16
name I know what their name is this one
64:17
right here is there's a whole group
64:20
there angels are made in tribes both on
64:22
Gabriel side the first tribes were hid
64:25
in heaven they weren't angels he made
64:27
them in tribes because they had a
64:29
defined purpose every tribe had a
64:31
defined purpose and this one is the
64:33
guardian angel over the state of New
64:35
York
64:36
his name is Excalibur can you see his
64:40
face very clearly in the back can you
64:45
see it oh thank you yeah he looks like a
64:50
lion
64:52
you see his mouth up and you can see his
64:55
Mane yeah he's part of the tribe of the
65:00
Royal Guard they all look like lions
65:03
you've seen a lot of lines in the sky it
65:05
was these guys right here and they do
65:09
look like they look like lions and they
65:11
guard the Royals because you are kings
65:14
and priests into your God so that is
65:18
their defying purpose they come to guard
65:20
those who will rule and reign with
65:22
Christ so that's that's the Royal Guard
65:25
I also have ones that transport troops
65:28
from heaven at pictures of the troops of
65:31
heaven have pictures of one that goes
65:33
into as covert and he he videotapes the
65:38
actions of darkness and he goes right up
65:41
to Michael's throne Michaels building he
65:44
has one eye okay this is this is that
65:48
angel its name is scout because he's a
65:50
scout he goes behind the lines you
65:54
should be able to see the one big eye
65:56
it's right here you see a mark on that
65:59
angel see that mark next to his eye it's
66:05
a mark like a tattoo God marks the enemy
66:09
stole it
66:10
that's God's thing he marks them with
66:12
different marks and this one right here
66:14
is literally going like this looking and
66:19
watching activities of Hell's army who
66:21
are clueless to what they're doing they
66:24
are absolutely clueless and so he's
66:28
standing in a cloud in his wings or
66:30
other army members of the hosts to
66:32
protect them from any attacks of the
66:34
enemy and so God has really good plans
66:36
so this is a scout host of hosts of
66:39
heaven with one eye right here if you
66:42
could see a close you could literally
66:43
see a face on the eye it records and
66:49
this is something he asked us to create
66:52
we didn't choose to do it ourselves I'm
66:55
gonna show you another one
66:57
oh we actually entry on here like here a
67:01
roll up your Raptor rug and roll up
67:03
you're out for rock and
67:05
in here we have things like don't forget
67:08
to ask for grace for today and then we
67:11
have special days we put a special days
67:14
in here we don't have Halloween so sorry
67:17
we took it out we took liberties we
67:29
don't have holidays from other false
67:30
religions either so get used to it and
67:34
so then we put statements at the bottom
67:36
each the Holy Spirit gave us you must
67:38
choose to be chosen you know that thing
67:41
God many are called but few are chosen
67:44
is because they didn't choose to be
67:46
chosen you choose it you choose to be
67:49
chosen this one is one of the best ones
67:51
we have his name is Rex yeah it's it's
68:00
me do you see his face he looks like a
68:03
lion he's high up in the command of the
68:08
Royal Guard really high up he's got
68:11
wings that come from his neck my
68:14
son-in-law likes to say he has horns and
68:16
I want one no he didn't really have
68:17
horns those are wings and I can't do
68:21
this as well so my turn around this is
68:23
one wing and this is another one and
68:25
there's eyes lining there's eyes in all
68:27
these wings eyes he has the eye on the
68:29
end of his beard
68:31
this is his moustache can you see his
68:33
moustache it's long isn't that people
68:37
say do angels have beards and mustaches
68:39
the answer is yes you can see them right
68:40
here he's holding a scroll on his hand
68:46
can you see the scroll this is the
68:49
scroll has a face it's a living scroll
68:53
his name is Justus that scroll was
69:01
dropped inside of me I had to say yes
69:04
because I was said during the time when
69:08
when we would command and the scrolls
69:11
name is Justus and God said that he
69:12
would read himself to me
69:15
would that bother you've got to ask you
69:18
that
69:18
what would you say that's well I
69:21
actually had to say yes my husband was
69:24
with me somebody who never sees angels
69:26
he's got five layers of a soul he's
69:28
Scottish he's like a mountain he can't
69:31
be moved anywhere he just belong to
69:33
Jesus but he was with me when this beam
69:35
came in over five storeys of condos and
69:37
when spiritual beings come in the
69:39
physical realm they flatten they come in
69:42
and then they open up we have pictures
69:44
of him flattened coming in we had
69:48
pictures of him fully open we have
69:50
pictures of him just waiting and then I
69:53
asked the Holy after I got nuns
69:55
screaming and yelling my husband's like
69:57
oh something's coming in that was his
70:00
whole statement something's coming in
70:02
I'm like I'm excited I'm so excited
70:06
wonder what he's here for a wonder what
70:08
he wants and so I saw the spirit what is
70:10
he here for was he's got orders from
70:12
headquarters during the army from heaven
70:15
for you to command and I said what I do
70:18
he says you have to say I receive the
70:20
scroll so I said I received it he
70:22
dropped it and went inside of me and I
70:25
said well whatever do he said nothing
70:26
it'll read itself to you scrolls in
70:30
heaven books in heaven read themselves
70:32
to you so this is normal for heaven this
70:36
is what happens when you live
70:37
supernatural this is what happens when
70:39
you choose to live the way God designed
70:40
you to be amen and so we have heard him
70:45
say one word and there's another picture
70:48
after this I don't have that with me but
70:51
after he dropped the scroll out of this
70:53
this rift this deep blue is heaven right
70:57
there that's heaven and when I said yes
70:59
and you dropped inside of me out of
71:01
these came two more beings one had a
71:03
shofar one had a trumpet they began to
71:06
blow them because God was signifying
71:08
something the earth was going to command
71:11
the army and so that's what that
71:15
signified if I had said no it might have
71:18
changed things or he would have found
71:20
someone else I wasn't willing to do that
71:22
amen so I have that picture you
71:24
literally see these
71:25
beings one looks very ancient he's got a
71:27
long beard his eyes a rectangle and he's
71:30
got a shofar the other one has a trumpet
71:33
trumpet he's just got like a big like a
71:36
I can't remem what you call those things
71:39
capes or woods whatever you want to call
71:41
that he had something like that and they
71:43
were there celebrating then they were
71:44
gone like that so we had a very little
71:47
time I said I'm taking pictures I don't
71:49
know about you I'm taking pictures to
71:50
get some pictures of it so this is
71:52
what's in this calendar and every month
71:55
it has something to encourage you and
71:58
the hosts make toast may the hosts go
72:02
with you we say that to people all the
72:03
time stand up stand out be dangerous
72:05
against hell but this is not your normal
72:08
calendar okay and over here what we know
72:13
about that being we will tell you if we
72:15
know something about it right there will
72:17
tell you and and on the back he had us
72:20
actually we couldn't hide who we are I
72:22
said you're gonna show who you are so
72:24
this is about a company one quest
72:26
international tells you what it is
72:28
there's me there's Margaret and then we
72:31
have another page you said you're also
72:32
going to show the creative team I sent
72:34
all this through so people know who
72:36
helped to create it because I don't do
72:37
everything by myself
72:38
there I am there's our our very funny
72:44
English guy there's Jan okay in about
72:48
two weeks we had it done do you ever
72:52
work in any kind of marketing or
72:54
creating that's that's definitely that's
72:57
a heaven thing we stayed up we traveled
73:00
we worked on it in the hotel room the
73:02
hardest part was was picking out we just
73:04
put all these pictures out everywhere we
73:06
took them with us and then and God gave
73:09
us what to say push back darkness I mean
73:10
this whole thing is about God it's all
73:13
about heaven it's about God's time on
73:14
the earth and there's a there's others
73:18
so there's one for each month in here
73:19
and people go what the years have to
73:21
over yet but they're not done this is
73:24
about a time it's about a time like God
73:28
counts event by events this is an event
73:31
that God had picked scrolls were
73:34
literally open and heaven unlocked and
73:37
open
73:38
so the host could work with us to
73:40
fulfill their destiny that they were
73:42
created to war for us so that's my
73:45
introduction and we will have some back
73:50
there if we if we know the name some
73:54
look pretty fierce but these guys war
73:57
you think about they war just like a
74:00
military they're warring for you they
74:02
fight for you literally for you for your
74:05
family they'll keep the darkness as long
74:08
as you're not bringing in your home
74:09
they'll keep it out of your home amen
74:11
and so these are some of our products
74:13
our cups this is just our book cover of
74:16
book 1 that's what that is and
74:18
eventually we'll have whole sets of cups
74:21
made like with some of the hosts on them
74:23
that you can get you can go to revealing
74:31
heaven dot-com and they'll all be on all
74:33
those will be online
74:37
yeah our phone numbers on our website
74:40
you can call it if you can't find
74:41
something you can call it and so um yeah
74:44
our events are planned for specific
74:46
purposes that we have our own there to
74:48
train people to be prepared to be a part
74:50
of a move of God like we have for the
74:52
first time we're going to be training
74:53
whether Warriors at our event at the end
74:55
this next weekend actually it's called
74:58
heavens invitation and we've had every
75:01
year since we've been going and now
75:03
we're adding weather warriors as one of
75:05
the whole days to be trained how do you
75:07
train how you learn too because you know
75:10
Jesus already knew all that when he was
75:12
asleep in the boat he already knew he
75:14
could do that he was hoping the
75:17
disciples would learned from him and yet
75:19
what did they do there they're in terror
75:22
for their own life there's a lord of
75:23
glory on the boat with him and he's
75:25
sleeping I'm sure you wanted to say why
75:29
didn't you handle it when he learned to
75:32
multiply the food he was training them
75:33
the whole time why didn't you multiply
75:35
food we can go and buy it we can't fine
75:37
well why didn't you multiply it
75:39
I mean disciples he wanted them to learn
75:42
what he did why don't you traveling
75:44
through the spirit realm will fill up
75:45
God it
75:47
Philip did as a lifestyle it was so
75:49
normal for him he just did it you don't
75:53
try it you do only purpose and focus and
75:57
you keep doing it and something is going
76:00
to happen and he doesn't care if you're
76:04
ninety nine or nine it's what you choose
76:07
what you decide you want but wherever
76:10
you don't don't reject it
76:13
sometimes it's Jesus just taught them
76:16
something he didn't say what do you want
76:17
this or not he just did it it's up to
76:21
you if you do it or not amen
76:23
and this new time we're living in the
76:26
earth where we will demonstrate the
76:28
power of the Living God we're not
76:32
waiting on that time we're in that time
76:34
you weren't here the last time I was
76:36
here I just got back from Reno where I
76:38
walked on the air who wants to do that
76:43
be passionate about it
76:46
I didn't even walk on water first I know
76:49
Jesus said the books I did you will do
76:51
and greater works you will do I jumped
76:53
right into the greater works you know
76:56
why that happened because I was
76:57
violently passionate about something I
77:00
had just hit my foot under stone and I
77:04
roared this should not have happened to
77:07
me I will not tolerate this again your
77:09
word says that the angels will catch me
77:11
up so I don't even - my foot on a stone
77:13
I will never do that again
77:15
and so next the week after I'm in Reno
77:17
and between the green room and where we
77:20
were there was a drop-off this big I
77:22
walked right off of it I didn't even
77:25
think I didn't know I was walking in
77:27
here but I had said that and this the
77:29
floor of a stone that was really humor I
77:32
think on their part I said it wouldn't -
77:34
stop and literally I don't know if they
77:37
caught me I don't know what they did I
77:38
don't know what they did I just know I
77:40
didn't hit it I didn't fall on it I
77:42
didn't hit it my foot didn't get dashed
77:44
my head didn't get - it was like so high
77:47
I would have fallen my whole body would
77:48
have been I just walked like it was
77:49
nothing I'm just doing the father's
77:51
business right the pastor's in front of
77:53
me walking and talking and I'm just
77:54
walking and talking behind him and gents
77:56
are shelling you're floating in air
78:00
and what no I'm not I had my iPad or
78:04
holding my iPad and I'm just talking to
78:06
the pastor she says yes you are yes you
78:08
are you know I thought she was playing a
78:10
joke on me or something so I just keep
78:11
walking I'm walking I walked out about 6
78:14
foot she goes you are walking on air why
78:21
don't you look down so I'm walking
78:24
outside I went I threw my iPad and I was
78:29
there for about three more seconds just
78:31
so he knew I would never forget that I
78:33
was walking out here and I just went
78:35
down really slow
78:36
I began shaking Jen we were shaking and
78:40
the pastor owns what just happened
78:41
jingles she was flirting and he's a
78:44
really good friend he said that's
78:45
awesome
78:46
will you do it out in the congregation
78:51
why you just walk off that platform
78:53
sweetie I want you to walk out that
78:54
place son the whole time I'm when I
79:00
first looked down and went wow it was
79:01
this like walking on water and the
79:03
father said oh no Jesus could feel the
79:05
water he knew water was there didn't
79:09
have anything to do but he said he could
79:10
feel the water you couldn't feel the air
79:13
no I couldn't say that's a greater work
79:16
okay and he said well I'll get used to
79:18
it until everybody they better start
79:20
getting used to it everybody say I
79:22
receive it
79:25
this is definitely a different time we
79:28
can't we can't think the same if you
79:31
stay in your old mindset that's where
79:34
you'll be when you either die and go to
79:36
heaven or get raptured if you're gonna
79:37
live for a couple hundred more years
79:38
you'll probably get raptured if not then
79:40
you're probably just going to go there
79:43
and I've been shown a lot in the future
79:46
and we're just starting into something
79:47
so powerful the next 50 years will be so
79:50
powerful on this very powerful I have
79:56
grandchildren that are already being
79:57
caught up to heaven it will be normal
80:00
for children to visit heaven normal
80:02
especially if their parents are
80:04
believers it's gonna be normal he
80:08
describes it all the time things that
80:10
I've seen that I never even told him
80:11
about okay he was three when it started
80:14
rota volcano or the lava of a volcano
80:18
with my father who lives in heaven and
80:20
with Jesus huh
80:25
he'd never met my father he called him
80:28
grandpa but my dad looks 25 and he said
80:32
and he gave me some Mary Janes
80:35
he didn't know where Mary Jane was maybe
80:37
somebody's you don't know either
80:39
my dad's favorite candy in heaven he was
80:43
giving him candy what do grandparents do
80:44
they give candy so they still get to
80:49
heaven he was with him and they were
80:51
gonna ride this volcano and he was
80:53
telling his mom all this and she said
80:54
you better get over here right now get
80:56
over here I said what did you expect
80:57
what's gonna happen
80:58
and so he's telling me all this Indy
81:00
goes you know what and a three year old
81:02
would not know even how a volcano was
81:05
well he said there was lava it was red
81:07
it was like kind of burning like and he
81:09
said you know this mount was really cool
81:11
grandpa took us straight up the side of
81:13
the mountain no wheels on his car we we
81:17
just kind of glided up to the top in the
81:19
mountain we jumped off and went inside
81:21
the volcano he said you know what my mom
81:25
he said that would have burned anybody
81:28
else to death but because of my god
81:33
we didn't burn we wrote on and it was a
81:38
fun ride and he you know what he's seven
81:49
now and it hasn't stopped
81:51
he'll preach to anybody anything he
81:55
talks to his army he asked for grace
81:59
every day and he looses stuff from his
82:01
soul they don't ever have meltdowns in
82:05
their car because as soon as they can
82:07
talk she teaches him how to ask for
82:09
credits this is our life this is this is
82:13
our life this is how we're supposed to
82:15
be living we're not from this world we
82:19
live here worse we'll be acting like the
82:21
world we come from amen so it's already
82:27
starting it's already starting you know
82:31
I have three daughters they see they
82:34
hear I told them they had two and
82:40
they're a girl might you won't sin
82:42
because you don't get a choice I'm not
82:46
letting you guys not letting you he said
82:48
he needed holy seed in this earth and I
82:50
gave up myself to get married and have
82:52
you hi this is their conversation when
82:55
they're little just looking at me I
82:58
expect you to do greater things than I
83:00
do and my grandchildren will be even
83:03
greater so you will have nine children
83:05
[Laughter]
83:07
people don't tell you kiss him it's
83:10
better than the screaming telling
83:11
there'll be nothing in their dumb they
83:14
never thought they were that they never
83:17
thought they were those things and if
83:19
someone told me they said oh no I'm not
83:20
I belong to Jesus Christ
83:24
one day when we had everything we owned
83:26
taken away from us not our fault thrown
83:28
out of our home we packed everything up
83:30
we picked our kids up in a moving van
83:32
and my daughter who is 16 said to me
83:39
what an adventure with God I cannot wait
83:42
to see what is he gonna do with us I am
83:45
so excited
83:46
she's 16 raise him up in the admonition
83:55
of the Lord
83:58
train them up in the gifts that God gave
84:01
them and they'll never depart from those
84:03
gifts the advance had never stopped they
84:08
never ran in the world I'm serious never
84:10
ran in the world trying to figure out
84:11
who they were they knew they were
84:13
dancers that was what he made them it
84:15
was their passion from the time they
84:17
were three four and eight that's all
84:21
they ever did they didn't want to be
84:23
something else they knew they were a
84:26
gift sent from heaven and that's the
84:28
gift they were every good and perfect
84:31
gift comes down from the father of you
84:35
were those lights why would he say that
84:38
why would he put that in the same thing
84:40
why would he say that together every
84:43
good and perfect gift comes down from
84:44
the Father of lights you were the lights
84:47
your spare man's made out of light you
84:49
were a gift he sent you it's not that
84:53
hard that's God to give you revelation I
84:59
want you to enjoy your life I want you
85:02
to celebrate your life you choose every
85:07
day to be happy you're not happy there's
85:09
no excuse to not be happy you don't have
85:11
to keep that junk in you so stand up
85:15
we're gonna do it I know you've done it
85:16
again we're gonna do it i'ma pray over
85:18
you and I'm gonna let you go
85:19
amen I know there's new people here if
85:24
you don't know about a soul checkup it's
85:26
a lifestyle it is a lifestyle it will
85:31
keep you so full of God so happy so
85:34
inspired it opens up portals of heaven
85:36
over you you get witty ideas and
85:39
inventions you can even share it with
85:40
others to help them because you have a
85:45
will you can do this you have a soul he
85:48
gave it to you you decide to use it or
85:51
not using I'm not forcing anyone you say
85:52
yes or no you do it or you don't do it
85:54
it's really easy because almost
85:56
everything God ever gave us is some
85:59
he talks to me like I'm eight he doesn't
86:04
give me big words he doesn't give me any
86:08
long you know any long definitions on
86:12
stuff he keeps it really simple that's
86:15
why eight-year-olds can read my book and
86:17
if they follow me and they come to a
86:19
meeting they won't want their own they
86:22
don't want to share it with their
86:23
parents and their parents we'll play
86:27
there's over 400 hours of me speaking on
86:29
YouTube a lot of them played me all
86:31
night long and those kids love it they
86:34
wander no truth they want to know who
86:36
God is no one can tell them there's
86:38
something else because what you fill
86:41
yourself with you will become amen so
86:46
this is so simple you're gonna choose
86:47
with your will to do this first you're
86:51
gonna choose and say I choose my will to
86:53
lose from my soul and then I'll give a
86:55
list of most things that people have in
86:57
their souls if I don't say something you
86:59
can say it yourself you can also lose
87:01
soul ties you made with other people
87:03
that didn't treat you nice so good you
87:05
can loose them from your soul then when
87:07
we're all done because I see Jesus come
87:10
down and he pulls things out of you
87:11
literally it's like grey matter he pulls
87:13
it out and then you bind things of God
87:18
and they come in waves each thing you
87:22
say it comes in a wave and I feel it go
87:25
through me and through everybody here
87:26
like the love of God the life I feel it
87:29
comes like a wave so here we go are you
87:31
ready you say as a child of God I choose
87:36

87:38

10:40
i can tell some of you have been all
10:42
closed up and you've
10:43
you've been in your closets and you've
10:45
been praying and you've been getting
10:46
ready
10:47
for this hour tonight as you begin to
10:51
just worship just
10:52
put aside everything i know i know we're
10:55
really
10:55
good with social distancing right now
10:58
and we're
10:59
we know that you're right on doing right
11:01
there and uh

11:09
hearts
11:11
some of you have heavy hearts over
11:12
different things that have happened
11:13
different things that are going on in
11:15
your lives
11:17
or things that uh as cat comes tonight

and so you just prepare
11:31
for what god's gonna do and one of the
11:33
greatest ways you can do is you begin to
11:34
worship because you put aside
11:36
everything and you just press into the
11:39
lord

[Music]
23:52
thank you teagan renato
23:56
we've got so many guests here tonight we
23:57
want to talk a little bit about protocol
23:58
and what's going on
23:59
um we want to minister to you our desire
24:02
the deepest desire of everyone here in
24:04
this house is that you have a personal
24:05
encounter with god tonight
24:07
that he speaks to you personally that he
24:09
touches your heart
24:10
and you get to see and hear him in a new
24:12
and special way tonight
24:14
and so that's why they want special ed
24:16
to say that to you
24:17
so we have some protocols for it if you
24:18
came with somebody you know obviously it
24:20
doesn't
24:21
we don't want to tell you you can't pray
24:22
for your family or anything like that
24:23
but here's what we do ask if it's not
24:24
someone you know or someone you came
24:26
with
24:26
we ask that you do not pray for other
24:28
people we have special team fire team
24:29
you'll notice people throughout the
24:31
house with tags like this
24:32
fire team tags we want to minister to
24:34
you and these are people who have been
24:36
specially annoyed especially chosen
24:37
within the house
24:38
so they can pray with you and pray for
24:39
you if you have a need seek someone out
24:41
we're more than happy to minister to you
24:43
after service will probably be the ones
24:44
to be ministering to you but we just
24:46
don't want to have
24:46
everybody ministering to everybody
24:48
because we want to make sure you're
24:49
guarded we want to make sure that that's
24:50
done in a special way and it's done
24:51
with an anointed in presence of the
24:53
house and what god's doing here tonight
24:55
so we ask that you do that
24:56
again when we let our hair down and do
24:58
this you're welcome
24:59
to come up and worship and really let it
25:01

from heaven earth
98:54
this night i light a flame on the top of
98:58
this mountain
99:00
it will never be put off
99:06
for you have stood to adversity
99:10
through the lies to the accusations
99:15
through the control the demands of
99:18
man you have worshipped me
99:23
you have not forgotten my son you have
99:26
not forgotten what he's done
99:29
you will be blessed and you will never
99:32
stop being blessed
99:36
for i am the god of everybody
99:40
and the god of everything i'm about to
99:43
shake this
99:44
earth great exposure of the darkness
99:54
matter what people or the fake news
99:57
or the lying liberals have said about me
100:01
or this time they don't
100:05
know anything
100:08
[Music]
100:12
if they do not stop they will lose
100:15
everything their words will become
100:19
dust and blown away like they were never
100:22
there
100:25
for i say this is a time of greatness
100:28
of acceleration you've never known are
100:31
the manifested sons and daughters
100:35
to come forth to demonstrate to manifest
100:39
my power my love
100:44
my plans the devil has plans
100:52
he will fail and he will lose
100:55
again and again and again
101:00
and again and again and again
101:06
[Music]
101:08
for i have already said i will be in the
101:11
white house for
101:12
24 years
101:20
there is no one on this earth in this
101:23
earth
101:24
under this earth that can stop it from
101:26
happening
101:29
for i will have these days on the earth
101:32
the great days
101:34
the great days of knowing there is a god
101:38
that he speaks that he sears sees and
101:44
hears
101:46
if my prophets do not prophesy what i
101:49
say
101:50
they will not have a voice until that
101:52
season is over
101:55
for these are not the days of doom and
101:56
gloom
101:58
these are not the days of the rapture
102:00
the perilous times the tribulation
102:05
they're times of greatness
102:09
of the fire and the glory sweeping over
102:12
this earth touching everyone
102:16
crushing the darkness and pushing it
102:18
back
102:21
for i am cleaning the stage
102:25
wiping it clean are the enemies camp
102:28
are the enemy's people are the enemies
102:31
dust
102:32
[Music]
102:34
for i will have my way my son made a way
102:40
i will not ignore what he has done and i
102:43
will not have a weak pathetic testimony
102:45
of his sacrifice
102:50
no one says when he is coming back but
102:54
me
102:55
and i am not ready
102:59
for i will set you on fire
103:02
and you will demonstrate like no one has
103:05
before in all of history
103:08
the powerful things of god to speak to
103:10
the land
103:11
the sea in the air and it will move
103:15
do not tolerate evil and do not
103:17
participate with it
103:21
you choose life or death
103:24
because they're apparently out there
103:26
right now
103:28
always choose life
103:31
for when you side with those who want
103:33
death of the unburned
103:36
you will never win you will never
103:40
succeed or complete your destiny
103:43
you will repent
103:47
because i bring life and life abundantly
103:52
but you must choose it and if you choose
103:55
it
103:56
you must live it
103:59
get out of the gray area stop riding on
104:02
the fence
104:05
for i hear those who've humbled
104:07
themselves whose heart cries out for
104:10
more but this time
104:14
you get to bring them more
104:21
i said it would be my sons and daughters
104:24
who did it
104:26
there is no age for them whether it's
104:29
three
104:31
or 153
104:35
you choose
104:38
for if you sit on the side and do
104:39
nothing that's what you will have
104:42
a boring life an unfruitful life
104:46
be bold and step out let people know
104:50
what you believe
104:51
and who you believe they'll come beating
104:55
your door down
104:56
to find out about your god not the false
105:00
gods who have no life
105:03
not the lies of the enemy he thinks he
105:06
can take
105:07
my country for it is mine
105:12
i created it i called it into being
105:16
i had people fight for it and die for it
105:21
in the seasons past you've died
105:25
to live for me but it now you will live
105:28
and not die if you choose
105:33
was it what is it to you if i keep you
105:37
until my son returns
105:42
be strong be excited
105:47
and celebrate the victory even before it
105:50
happens
105:51
[Music]
105:56
do not listen to the doom and gloom
105:59
that does not come from me
106:03
but fearful hearts that don't know what
106:06
time it is
106:06
they don't know what my plans are and
106:09
they want to escape
106:15
run your race but run it with me
106:22
for i'll be right beside you and i will
106:26
open the eyes of many
106:28
and they will see me and they will know
106:31
their god
106:33
those who have stood and been faithful
106:36
even under attack even though things
106:37
were taken from you
106:39
do you not think i can give you a
106:41
hundred times more than what you had
106:47
it is my desire to bless you
106:50
it is my desire to be with you
106:56
for there are times there are only in
107:00
the power of my hand
107:03
and these are some of those times
107:10
listen to what is true where there is no
107:14
confusion
107:15
and nothing hidden
107:18
don't believe the lies of those who live
107:20
in sin and say they live and speak for
107:23
me
107:25
some have removed from the earth
107:27
[Music]
107:28
i won't allow their testimony of who i
107:31
am to be here
107:37
many who are lying cheating and stealing
107:40
and even killing
107:42
will lose not just their state but their
107:45
life
107:49
this is a holy time but it is a time
107:52
to celebrate
107:56
heaven celebrates with this time
107:59
live on earth like they live in heaven
108:04
but you have to be willing and
108:07
obedient
108:10
the host will not listen to those
108:13
to be commanded by those who do not
108:16
speak the words of my son
108:18
nor have him in their heart not just as
108:22
their savior
108:23
but as their king
108:28
many kings will come forth in this time
108:31
for my son is the king of spiritual
108:34
kings
108:35
and the lord of spiritual lords
108:40
and the spirit there is no difference
108:42
between male nor female
108:46
both can rise to that position
108:50
of authority and dominion
108:54
but you have to pursue it
108:55
[Music]
108:57
and if you want my thoughts you better
109:01
walk in my ways
109:04
and you better say his will
109:09
his way not his will
109:12
man's way
109:16
i'm about to consume this country
109:21
and people will come here to find me not
109:25
just the american dream
109:31
some regions the light and the glory
109:33
will be so great in
109:34
people will drive their dead relatives
109:37
in there they'll come to life
109:43
neither sin nor crime nor sickness will
109:46
be able to abide in those regions
109:50
[Music]
109:51
you are forerunners it is an honor and a
109:54
privilege to be chosen
109:58
if you're alive and you're breathing
110:01
and you've given yourself to my son you
110:04
are chosen
110:11
know this night that your god has
110:13
visited you
110:16
and spoken his words to you
110:20
if they don't light up with others then
110:23
do not receive
110:24
those words for i stand on my work
110:30
and beside my son on my throne
110:36
these are days we have talked about
110:38
before you were ever
110:39
born before the earth was made we spoke
110:42
of these days
110:44
why would i give them up
110:53
if you buy a bible and it says it's my
110:56
word and it's left parts out
110:58
don't read it
111:02
if it makes it easy to live to freely
111:05
sin
111:07
there's other gods beside me that can
111:10
bring you to my home
111:12
those are lies from hell
111:16
for my word and my truth
111:19
will make you free
111:22
says your god a man
111:34
[Music]
111:50
[Music]
112:00
oh
112:06
can you hear me now
112:21
[Music]
112:22
i know there are people who will tell
112:24
you that you cannot see the faces of god
112:27
and live but even the one who spoke
112:31
those words
112:32
and they were written in the word saw
112:35
the face of god
112:37
john himself in the book of john said
112:40
you cannot see the face of god and live
112:43
but in the book of revelation in chapter
112:46
4
112:47
he was caught up
112:52
he was in the spirit
112:55
that's a place you walk in
113:01
he's in a place on that day where he
113:04
could hear no word of man
113:06
on the isle of patmos at least that day
113:10
unless he decided to walk off of it
113:15
i chose to let him see things are
113:24
different
113:30
because he was in that place i could
113:32
catch him up
113:34
and stand before my throne with the
113:37
living rainbow
113:38
moving in and out of me with
113:41
life moving in and out of me
113:45
and he saw my face
113:48
and never again after that did he say
113:51
you cannot see the face of god and live
113:57
for i have caught many up and showed
113:59
many my face
114:02
my plans but this one standing before
114:06
you she is my revelator
114:10
i will never stop taking her to heaven
114:13
what business is it to you if i want to
114:18
i held the air you breathe
114:21
if i choose somebody
114:24
who's been willing and obedient and laid
114:27
down their life
114:30
every time i asked
114:36
why would i not trust her
114:40
yes she's a woman and she's a king in
114:44
the spirit
114:51
she's not just my servant she is my
114:54
daughter
114:57
and it is my great pleasure to reveal
115:00
her
115:00
as my treasure to operate without
115:03
measuring these days
115:06
[Music]
115:09
if you're willing to pay the price
115:14
you think it's so easy
115:18
to have to live a halfway normal life on
115:20
this earth
115:21
when you're so connected to me in heaven
115:26
she does not see things like you see
115:30
them
115:32
but she will reveal everything i show
115:34
her
115:36
and will not be afraid of the face of
115:38
man
115:40
even hell trembles when she speaks
115:46
[Applause]
115:48
everyone should be dangerous against
115:50
hell
115:53
[Music]
115:56
it is evil and wickedness that tries to
115:59
consume your country
116:01
but i will not tolerate it for my people
116:05
have humbled themselves
116:09
they have repented of their wicked ways
116:13
and i will heal their land
116:16
[Music]
116:22
for i hear everyone and i see everyone
116:25
nothing is hidden
116:26
from me
116:29
when i look at the earth i rejoice
116:36
i remember when my son and i made it
116:40
we made it to kerry the glory
116:43
the power the wonder
116:50
a stopover station before you come home
117:03
i know your trials i know your test
117:08
if you fall down get up
117:11
[Applause]
117:16
tell the enemy you will no longer
117:17
tolerate him in your life
117:20
that means you will not tolerate his
117:22
images his words
117:24
his frequencies his songs
117:34
you create a habitation for heaven in
117:37
your home
117:39
and it will come
117:43
you will see angels coming and going for
117:52
you are in a new season
117:55
the season of the high call of god of
117:57
your god
118:01
why did you not expect for things to be
118:04
exposed
118:06
before every great thing was done hell
118:09
always acted up
118:14
but this time the exposure is for your
118:16
benefit
118:19
these are not new things they've always
118:21
been here
118:22
you just never knew it
118:26
i'm pulling away every closed door
118:30
basement building
118:34
things hidden in the wilderness things
118:36
hidden in the forest
118:38
even things hidden underground i will
118:40
expose it all
118:49
[Applause]
118:50
the lives of those those who want to
118:53
stand and run your country
118:56
but hate me hate life
119:00
even hate the people they want to govern
119:03
it will not happen
119:05
[Applause]
119:12
for i will shake them
119:15
and nothing will be hidden but openly
119:19
shown
119:20
and dealt with even those have already
119:23
been in power and think they've gotten
119:25
away with it
119:30
they will not
119:39
trump may not be perfect
119:43
but he gives me permission
119:48
to be in this country from the highest
119:52
office in the land he has welcomed me
119:56
and prayed to me and made friends with
119:59
my pastors
120:01
my prophets my teachers my evangelist
120:08
his closest friends are my sons and
120:10
daughters
120:13
but the world would reject them and hate
120:15
them
120:18
there are many people in this world
120:19
praying for your president
120:22
even they love him even they recognize
120:26
the good in him the authority in him
120:31
he will help to shift many leaders of
120:33
many governments
120:35
so i can shape that nation
120:42
and he will sweep his platform clean one
120:45
day
120:46
to make room for pence
120:50
i have heard words spoken against my
120:53
vice president
120:54
and i am not happy
120:58
he is a godly man who is not afraid of
121:02
anything
121:05
he is a strong tower to temper your
121:08
president
121:17
he will win two terms also
121:23
[Applause]
121:28
for i have written that in my book and
121:30
what my book says
121:32
it will happen not maybe happen
121:36
[Applause]
121:38
whoever he picks to be his vice
121:40
president will then be president for
121:42
eight years after him
121:46
by that time there'll be no opposition
121:48
that will even have a voice to speak
121:50
[Music]
121:51
[Applause]
121:56
america will be a great light to this
121:58
world
122:02
it is my gift to this world
122:07
who allows my son my greatest gift to
122:09
operate in this world
122:14
get ready because the show is beginning
122:18
[Applause]
122:23
[Music]
122:39
there's coming a day when people will
122:41
step into
122:43
a store thinking they're going to buy
122:44
something
122:46
and they will step into my glory and
122:48
begin to cry out to know me
122:51
[Music]
122:57
satan knows about these days
123:01
but he was hoping he could stop them
123:12
this is a place of freedom liberty and
123:15
justice for all
123:19
it is also a place for righteousness and
123:22
holiness
123:27
that your amazing forefathers heard my
123:31
voice
123:31
and made plans for it
123:35
the enemy has always been afraid of
123:40
america
123:46
don't be afraid
123:50
even if you come home you'll be with me
123:55
there is no fear not even in death
123:59
you just step from life to life
124:04
[Applause]
124:07
if your family live here they're the
124:10
most blessed
124:11
people in existence
124:18
make plans to be great
124:23
because it is time
124:29
for i will pour out my spirit on all
124:30
flesh
124:36
children will begin to pastor at age
124:38
five
124:40
[Applause]
124:47
children are the easiest to reach
124:49
because they don't question
124:51
and they don't reason and they don't let
124:53
their mind
124:54
get involved that's why i said you must
124:58
be like a little child
125:02
to enter into the kingdom
125:10
you have not because you asked not
125:14
but those who've asked already will
125:16
surely get what they have asked for
125:23
it is a new time on the earth
125:28
a miracle will be an example
125:31
but many countries will run to the light
125:34
and to my son
125:40
for there is a habitation coming
125:45
that will not end until i say it will
125:50
[Applause]
126:00
end rejoice that i have shown these
126:03
things and spoken to you of these things
126:08
for those are my plans
126:17
the more you believe it is real
126:20
the more real it will become
126:37
there's coming a day very soon that when
126:40
you come here
126:44
the glory will be waiting
126:59
portals are being opened everywhere
127:05
for heaven to pour in
127:08
but also for blessings to pour in
127:22
those who say i cannot speak through the
127:25
voice
127:26
of a man or mankind
127:29
don't know me
127:37
make sure you laugh
127:41
laughter is the language of heaven
127:46
but profanity is the language of hell
127:51
don't let those words be in your mouth
127:54
in your home
127:58
allowed to enter into your home
128:02
guard your soul and the souls of your
128:04
children
128:06
by not letting anything pass
128:10
through any form of media
128:15
it will be a trap of the enemy
128:18
and what you've given permission to come
128:21
will come
128:38
if you say good morning to me every
128:41
morning
128:42
you'll be saying it before my throne
128:48
you command the day by what you choose
128:51
when you first wake
128:53
up
128:59
choose life and love
129:03
my power my presence
129:07
extreme discernment
129:15
and get understanding
129:20
these days will come quickly
129:24
and your life will change day by day
129:32
so all who hear this message
129:36
if you are my son or my daughter
129:39
if you have received my son and repented
129:42
of your sins
129:43
these words are for you
129:52
do not walk around
129:55
with your head held down but lift it
129:59
up
130:03
where your help comes from
130:07
even if people laugh they will
130:10
not be laughing for long term
130:17
pray for those who have chosen the
130:19
darkness
130:21
and are expecting it to win some will
130:23
take their life
130:24
when they lose because
130:28
their souls have been compromised
130:32
by the lies they've been listening to
130:35
guard well the layers of your soul what
130:38
you put there
130:45
and always choose life
130:50
i love you says your god amen
130:58
[Applause]
131:04
[Music]
131:10
[Music]
131:14
yes
131:15
[Music]
131:15
[Applause]
131:19
[Music]
131:22
yes
131:24
[Music]
131:50
oh
132:00
it is hard to stand
132:03
i won't fall
132:08
i'm sure my angels are behind me
132:16
i don't want a stool
132:23
what is that
132:32
no
132:35
no but we could just lay hands on
132:38
everybody and end it
132:43
[Music]
132:47
it's pretty pretty hard to top god
132:58
and for those of you who don't think
133:00
this is real may he come to you
133:04
[Music]
133:14
when i walked in the angel of the lord
133:16
who looks just like jesus
133:18
came in behind me to make sure i
133:21
wouldn't fall down before i got up here
133:26
and god's been speaking to me like the
133:29
last several hours before i got here
133:32
and some people think why is she late
133:33
why is she late well are you going to
133:35
turn around and say no
133:37
to god
133:45
i was right on time
133:59
god was very wise calling me a revelator
134:03
instead of a prophet because he knew all
134:06
the bashers
134:08
wouldn't know what a false revelator was
134:14
[Music]
134:15
[Applause]
134:23
he was very detailed with me before i
134:26
started traveling and speaking
134:28
and he'd already warned me about a lot
134:30
of stuff that would happen or would be
134:32
said which
134:33
i understand people don't understand
134:37
what they don't know or they have not
134:39
experienced their self
134:41
it is hard for them to receive it
134:46
seeing is not believing
134:50
receiving is believing
135:00
god has given me many titles i didn't
135:02
ask for any of them
135:06
and many people say i want to be you i
135:07
go no you don't
135:12
you don't really and i've heard people
135:14
say he chose seven men before he chose
135:16
you no he didn't
135:20
he did choose me he knew me when i was
135:23
in him he knew every one of you
135:26
already knew what you would become and
135:29
on your soul that he created he wrote if
135:31
he would be male or female
135:34
no matter how man says how that happens
135:39
and your soul will be conflicted if
135:40
you're told you're something else
135:46
because your soul already knew what it
135:48
was supposed to be
135:52
but if the ones who wanted to take over
135:54
have their way
135:56
they would let anybody choose whatever
135:57
they want to
136:02
but god has a plan
136:05
you were with him before you came to
136:06
this earth before this world was made
136:09
before he stretched out the universe the
136:11
physical realm
136:12
over the spiritual realm that's why when
136:15
it says in revelations he will roll it
136:17
up
136:18
he knows where the ends are
136:23
he had to put something out there that
136:25
he could put physical things on
136:27
because all he had the original realm is
136:30
the spiritual realm
136:32
the unseen realm unless he lets you see
136:35
it
136:36
from the time i was little i was a seer
136:40
i saw the good guys and the bad guys
136:43
i saw activities at the spirit realm you
136:46
hear people talk about angels and demons
136:48
there's much more than that
136:49
all around you there's buildings built
136:51
that both sides
136:53
use depending on what is going around in
136:55
that area
136:57
there's platforms built by these spirits
137:00
of wickedness in high places how do they
137:01
get in high places
137:03
they earn it by hunting for souls for
137:06
the enemy
137:07
these are wicked spiritual beings
137:09
however
137:12
when you learn to command an army that
137:14
was created to pull down
137:16
every stronghold of satan they're
137:20
the ones who war against hell
137:23
no matter what level of wickedness they
137:25
operate in
137:26
they can shred those platforms built by
137:29
these spirits of wickedness in high
137:30
places
137:32
and they go through light buzz saws and
137:36
they can't stop it from happening
137:38
because we who have the flesh
137:42
you're the ones who have authority in
137:44
the earth
137:45
every spirit would be coming from hell
137:47
trying to take over
137:48
they use people like they apparently are
137:50
right now
137:51
but they cannot do it they can't
137:55
the earth is made for men and those who
137:58
receive jesus christ
138:00
you're called to rule in the spirit
138:02
realm
138:04
when you take authority and dominion in
138:05
the spirit realm it then in
138:07
packs and packs this physical realm
138:12
and because we haven't known how to do
138:14
it to his fullness
138:15
satan has just taken all he wants to
138:19
done what he wanted to kill who he wants
138:22
to
138:23
put fear in who he wants to we're not
138:26
tolerating it anymore
138:32
jesus clearly said the things i did you
138:34
will do and greater
138:36
things you will do than i did
138:40
so you should be trying to stop the
138:42
storms
138:45
we can help you do that
138:48
you can either email or call our office
138:51
and ask for
138:52
weather warrior information that's god's
138:54
name
138:56
that he gave for this group who's
138:59
willing to step
139:00
out and just do what his son did
139:03
i didn't pick that name we are to take
139:06
authority over
139:06
any form of destructive weather
139:11
and whether you know it or not in the
139:13
word of god when he made the ocean
139:15
and he made the land he told the ocean i
139:18
set a boundary right here at the land
139:22
and you will not pass over
139:28
that's god's word that's his decree we
139:31
are his sons and daughters it is
139:33
our job to uphold that
139:37
and tell those storms you will not cross
139:40
over on the land or do destruction
139:42
he created the weather to nourish the
139:45
earth
139:47
not to damage it
139:51
so we sit down here and say god come and
139:53
rescue us
139:56
come and stop this and he's looking down
139:58
saying i gave you authority
140:01
you have authority you
140:04
rule because the enemy knows he can get
140:06
in and twist any of those weather system
140:09
and use them the best he can because he
140:12
comes to what
140:13
kill steal destroy
140:16
and one of the ways he does that is with
140:18
the weather
140:21
so our volcanoes are not supposed to be
140:23
erupting
140:24
tsunamis are not supposed to be
140:26
destroying
140:28
none of that stuff that's going on but
140:31
there's been no voice
140:33
or agreement in the body that they would
140:36
no longer
140:37
tolerate that
140:40
he taught the disciples how to multiply
140:44
food how to travel in the spirit realm
140:48
how to take authority and dominion over
140:51
all the power of the darkness cast out
140:53
any and all demons
140:56
to pray for the sick to be healed why
140:59
are we tolerating
141:00
the virus
141:05
because i'm not it has no right here
141:13
the body needs to wake up stand up
141:18
and step out you can wake up all you
141:21
want to
141:22
he wants you to do all of those things
141:26
and i can tell you right now the
141:28
meteorologists don't know what's
141:29
happening
141:31
they're going wild we even have some of
141:34
their briefings where they talked about
141:36
what is wrong with this weather they're
141:39
almost
141:40
afraid to give a forecast of anything
141:43
because it never happens and then they
141:46
faked it
141:49
they faked it to prove these things were
141:51
happening those weren't even the storm
141:52
that was going on
141:56
those in the area that the storms are
141:58
headed to have the greatest authority if
142:00
you're a believer
142:04
so those on the east coast
142:07
we have melt we have built a wall
142:10
and if you go back and look at every
142:12
storm that's come after
142:14
dorian when we told it we all started
142:17
saying you will not and cannot cross
142:18
over
142:19
the boundaries god set for you and all
142:21
the way down not just in florida where
142:23
we started it
142:24
all the way up the east coast believers
142:26
were standing there saying you will not
142:27
cross over and do destruction
142:29
and every time a storm comes you can go
142:31
look at it
142:32
it comes a certain way then it hits the
142:34
wall and goes back out
142:38
and they don't understand it's simply
142:42
the body of christ
142:43
taking authority
142:46
so when we learn oh hawaii has got it
142:49
down
142:52
we have a lot of friends there's a lot
142:53
of weather warriors that live in hawaii
142:55
it doesn't even get started before they
142:56
get out there and they start
143:00
i'll never forget the time that this
143:02
massive like i think was category five
143:04
was coming
143:05
and i had been teaching and talking to
143:07
him about taking authority
143:09
and we all declared that this storm will
143:11
not be allowed to come ashore
143:13
and the head of it would be taken off
143:17
and when everyone went to bed except me
143:20
because i don't sleep at night
143:23
when they all went to bed when they woke
143:24
up there was nothing but shreds left
143:28
and they couldn't understand or get it
143:30
they knew for sure that the the island
143:32
would be consumed
143:34
and those people those weatherboards in
143:36
hawaii would not let up that prayer of
143:38
agreement we had
143:40
they said we don't know how it happened
143:41
but it looks like the head was taken
143:44
these are the meteorologists saying this
143:46
the head was taken right off
143:48
[Music]
143:50
it was a nothing and one reporter said
143:54
never in
143:54
25 years of being a meteorologist i ever
143:58
see i never saw that happen i'm still
144:01
trying to go back over all the tapes
144:03
all the information that we've
144:04
accumulated to know exactly what
144:06
should have happened and it didn't
144:08
happen
144:11
why because they're not tolerating it
144:15
so whoever lives in the gulf better
144:16
start stepping up
144:21
is not coming to florida
144:25
i live there and i'm not putting up with
144:28
it anymore
144:31
[Applause]
144:36
you need to just get fed up
144:46
what yes
144:50
whoever has the fires
144:55
in your state you better start saying
144:57
you're not tolerating it anymore
145:02
you come into low pressure system to
145:05
form
145:06
and come in and put the fires out
145:10
[Applause]
145:13
that is not something new in the bible
145:16
they called forth rain to come
145:19
and they begin to see the clouds form
145:22
did it
145:22
come and did it rain
145:28
why are we any different than them
145:31
it's called believing your faith
145:35
and guess what in heaven you'll need
145:36
your faith
145:38
not to pay your rent not to be healed
145:42
not for any of those things but to begin
145:45
to create
145:49
who is our father
145:54
do you know in the bible when it says
145:56
let us make men in our image that's what
145:58
they look like
146:00
like with the glory on them the light of
146:02
god on them
146:04
but after our likeness is how they
146:06
operate
146:09
we're supposed to operate like them we
146:11
are not god
146:14
you don't want to be god i don't want to
146:16
be god
146:18
i've seen a lot but i still don't want
146:19
to be god no one's that many kids
146:30
the devil actually isn't god's problem
146:35
it's how we all pray and stand against
146:37
them
146:40
he should be running does it say he will
146:42
run from us
146:46
do you remember that scripture
146:50
you submit yourself under the hand of
146:51
god and
146:53
resist the enemy
146:56
what will he do he will flee
147:00
from you he's talking to you
147:03
you do you know the word resist doesn't
147:06
go
147:06
oh no no i don't know what there's
147:08
something
147:10
i will not tolerate you you're a liar
147:13
and a friar
147:15
and i serve the most high god only him
147:24
and he'll run
147:28
there are people the demons beg not to
147:31
be assigned to
147:34
because when they come back and they're
147:36
not successful with their assignment
147:38
they get punished
147:40
the devil doesn't give anybody rewards
147:42
not even his own he just punishes them
147:44
when they don't listen
147:47
so they don't want to they'll lie
147:48
they'll do anything they can
147:50
they don't want to and by the way when
147:51
you learn to release the anointing they
147:53
burn on and it hurts they'll burn
147:57
if they get near the fire of god it will
147:58
burn them like it's going to melt them
148:01
they may live in hell's fire they don't
148:04
want god's fire
148:07
that's why baptism in fire is coming
148:12
[Applause]
148:15
see i was raised on the word of god
148:19
god chose when my birth would happen on
148:22
this earth
148:23
he chose my fathers my mothers by the
148:25
way my mother is here tonight
148:32
she'll be 90 next april
148:35
she had 15 children
148:39
i am number three and my sister's number
148:42
15 right there
148:45
and any of them could testify to
148:48
anything i am saying
148:50
i never was normal
148:56
i didn't want to speak to people even
148:58
though i was i didn't want to speak to
148:59
people i didn't want to hug them
149:03
i just wanted god jesus holy spirit you
149:05
know my little nice
149:06
apartment somewhere and do big business
149:10
he took me out of my world of business
149:13
yeah it's like he didn't know he needed
149:15
paychecks
149:18
seriously he did this he always told me
149:21
before he would do something
149:22
with me my grandmother was my dad's
149:25
mother was a powerful woman of god
149:27
she was in the jungles of panama and was
149:29
afraid of nothing
149:32
ever she'd come to our home on
149:35
sabbatical i mean we had more kids than
149:36
anybody she could have come any
149:38
anywhere i don't remember she had eight
149:39
or nine
149:41
of her own our aunts and uncles
149:44
so she had a lot of children but she
149:46
always came
149:47
to our house because god was there we
149:50
knew she could see through the walls
149:53
we knew she could see right inside of us
149:57
and every time she came she'd lay her
149:58
hand on her head you will
150:00
serve and know the most high god and my
150:04
brother would run and hide
150:07
i'm not going to be a missionary and be
150:08
eaten by the alligators or crocodiles
150:12
no right now they lock them on death row
150:14
to minister to death apprentice
150:16
prisoners
150:18
he's invited by hell's angels to come
150:19
and do funerals
150:22
i don't think he's afraid of crocodiles
150:24
anymore
150:28
my mom would tell me every day you are
150:30
so strange i don't know what god's going
150:32
to do with you
150:35
i was little i ate once a day i slept
150:38
four hours a day
150:40
my whole life i would know things
150:43
my siblings didn't care too much for
150:45
that
150:52
my dad was a great mentor but his own
150:55
mother in the jungles of panama on her
150:57
own
150:58
they had a murderer loose in the village
151:00
i know some of you heard the story
151:01
before but it just shows you
151:02
who she was she was on the mission field
151:05
in the little hut somewhere where she
151:06
was ministering and she i think she
151:08
lived there for
151:09
i forgot how many years many years and
151:11
everybody was boarding up their windows
151:13
to keep this murder from out she left
151:14
her window open
151:17
and she went to sleep right in front of
151:21
the window
151:24
because guess what she knew god sure
151:26
enough
151:27
late at night here comes a foot in the
151:29
window
151:30
and this huge machete coming with him
151:33
and she turn around look at him and she
151:34
goes freeze in jesus name
151:38
and rolled over and went back to sleep
151:42
and three hours later when the police
151:44
arrived
151:45
he was still frozen
151:50
[Applause]
151:53
that was my grandmother
152:02
i was taught to never be afraid
152:07
i knew there was a god i knew there was
152:09
his son
152:10
i knew there was holy spirit who is my
152:12
best friend
152:14
that means he'll tweak you 24 hours a
152:17
day
152:19
that's what that means let me speak to
152:21
you 24 hours a day but lots of times
152:23
he's tweaking you
152:28
he wouldn't warn me something's going to
152:29
happen i don't think i'd do that that's
152:31
what he says to me
152:33
i don't think i'd go there so i'm not
152:35
going to go there okay
152:36
i don't ask him why
152:40
but you have to have your ears open to
152:42
listen
152:43
and it's really good idea if you say i
152:46
choose holy spirit to give you
152:47
permission to get my attention when i'm
152:49
not paying attention
152:51
it is one of the most powerful things
152:53
you can say
152:54
anybody here let's just say it together
152:56
holy spirit
152:58
from this moment on i give you
153:02
permission
153:04
to get my attention when i'm not paying
153:07
attention
153:09
so be it there you did it
153:17
i did that when i was really young it
153:19
saved me a lot
153:21
let me tell you if i gave the mic to jen
153:24
she'd come up here now she would preach
153:26
all the time
153:27
she knows that's true because he does
153:28
the same thing with her
153:32
every morning
153:36
it's called living a new life
153:39
heaven culture isn't just a thing it's a
153:42
lifestyle
153:45
so if you want to live on earth as they
153:47
live in heaven you need to learn to live
153:49
heaven culture
153:52
what is that how they live in heaven
153:55
and living the same way on the earth
153:57
they're free of fear free of lack
154:00
free of grief free of anything of the
154:02
enemy
154:04
never sick they go well they're in
154:05
heaven yes
154:07
they are but our father who is in heaven
154:11
holy is your name your kingdom come by
154:14
the way
154:15
that is heaven your kingdom
154:19
is heaven you're speaking to the
154:22
father right your kingdom come
154:26
your will be done on earth as it is in
154:28
heaven that is heaven
154:30
culture you are literally praying a
154:32
prayer that asks for heaven culture
154:37
and he's released it on the earth you
154:40
choose it
154:42
you lose everything under your soul
154:43
that's not him every trauma from the
154:46
past every wicked evil
154:49
disgusting vile movie you've ever
154:50
watched with your eyes it's in your soul
154:54
that's why he says to guard it for out
154:56
of it will flow the way you live your
154:58
life
155:00
as a man think it's in his heart which
155:02
is your soul
155:03
not talking about your human beating
155:04
heart the heart also means the core
155:07
or the center of something that's your
155:09
soul that's what you are you are a
155:11
living soul
155:13
and what you fill it with is what you
155:15
will become
155:17
that's why people you've known all your
155:18
life kind nice people i know some of
155:20
them
155:21
who now hate with a hate i've never seen
155:23
before in people
155:25
they hate and despise don't even know
155:26
why why they listen to the fake news
155:30
and for years they have filled their
155:31
layers you have layers
155:33
whatever you feel the most of is what
155:35
you're going to begin to act like
155:40
so if you don't like you change what
155:42
you're watching
155:43
even what you say goes in your own soul
155:45
so if you don't like you
155:46
you've been telling yourself that for
155:48
years and you put another layer of it in
155:50
you
155:51
and what's in there is what you will
155:52
think about and if you think about it
155:53
you're going to choose it if you choose
155:55
it you're going to do it again that's
155:56
called
155:56
what criminals do
155:59
this is true that's why a criminal will
156:02
get out of prison
156:03
go commit a crime and go back right back
156:05
to prison if they've been there 20 years
156:06
it'll you know why it's in their soul
156:09
and i've been to prison to talk
156:13
it's good to hear that and i had 80
156:17
prisoners
156:18
and they had somebody guards trying to
156:20
watch
156:21
they never watched they listened to
156:23
protect me
156:24
my husband was with me sitting up here
156:26
staring at every one of them
156:32
but then even he was crying and i told
156:35
them how they were sought out by the
156:36
enemy even as a little child
156:38
they had a great call on their life so
156:40
he didn't want them to be loosed on the
156:42
earth
156:43
they might find out who they are and do
156:45
destruction to his plans
156:47
so he gets them into crime this is truth
156:49
he gets them into crime when you do it
156:51
it was in your soul
156:53
then he makes sure they get caught
156:57
and then they get put in prison where
156:59
they can't be a threat to him
157:02
so every time they get up because it's
157:03
in them guess what they do it doesn't
157:04
matter how much therapy they give them
157:06
how many classes they take them to if
157:08
they can't get it out of them
157:11
they'll think about it they'll do it and
157:14
then they're back in the same place
157:16
so i told them the story of their life
157:18
this is what you're doing this is why
157:19
you're doing it
157:20
this is what god had for you this is
157:22
what satan is doing to you
157:24
and will proceed to do it to every
157:25
member of your family if you can
157:27
then they begin to cry then they get
157:28
furious
157:30
you get mad at the devil then they get
157:33
born again
157:33
filled with the holy spirit then it
157:35
teaches them how to war
157:38
i teach them how to send heaven's army
157:40
so now
157:41
insider prisons are very dangerous
157:44
people
157:44
who are dangerous against hell
157:51
i mean anybody could go to prison right
157:53
but why are these people in rhythm
157:55
they are dangerous because of their
157:58
destiny
157:59
and satan doesn't want them loose
158:06
your soul is very important to you don't
158:09
ever forget that
158:11
you choose with your soul all day long
158:16
you choose christ right after that you
158:18
should choose what he chooses
158:20
all day long you should guide what you
158:23
choose what you watch what you say
158:26
i love that little saying these half
158:28
years what would jesus do
158:30
what would he say what would he choose
158:35
it's actually a very free life
158:38
to not sin people get shocked when they
158:42
say
158:42
i don't sin oh that's impossible no it's
158:46
not
158:48
you choose not to
158:52
you just say no
158:55
say no to who was ever asking you sorry
158:57
my soul is too important
159:00
i'm not corrupting my soul they'd really
159:02
think you were weird who cares
159:05
because when they start to die they'll
159:06
call you to pray for them
159:09
they'll look for you if it's on their
159:10
deathbed hey you know about heaven
159:13
i need to go there don't forget they
159:16
made fun of you
159:19
that's why it's important that you not
159:22
suffer
159:22
trauma for 30 years after it happened
159:26
you know who's doing that the devil
159:29
because you saw it or experienced it and
159:31
he will replay it and replay it stop
159:34
the video stop it stop it stop
159:38
it and lose it from your soul jesus and
159:41
after your will
159:41
because of jesus to lose it from your
159:43
soul he'll come down and pull it out
159:45
and it will literally be like it never
159:46
happened to you
159:48
i've seen too many people set free and
159:52
they went from being
159:53
you know in the drudges of despair
159:55
suicidal
159:56
they'd have these dreams every night
159:58
about the torment or whatever it was the
160:00
trauma they went through
160:01
and three minutes with me
160:04
and the revelation god gave me while
160:06
their husband their pastor went in the
160:08
store to get me some things to eat
160:09
i was invited to speak his wife was set
160:12
free she was a different person when he
160:13
came out
160:16
and then she brought her 17 year old and
160:18
her 11 eleven-year-old sons to me
160:20
because they were present when she was
160:21
abused so much they lose out all their
160:24
soul and they haven't
160:25
never six years later have never had
160:27
another nightmare or torment
160:33
you can be free the truth makes you free
160:37
and the truth is you can be free
160:42
even from heroin from witchcraft
160:48
homosexuality it doesn't matter what it
160:49
is from the enemy
160:52
you choose with your will to be free and
160:54
yes we pray for people to be free from
160:55
homosexuality
160:57
which is a spirit and guess what
161:00
they have powerful destinies every one
161:02
of them
161:04
the devil targets the ones
161:07
who have the greatest destinies to bring
161:10
freedom or liberty to people and he
161:12
wants to keep them from doing that so he
161:15
gets them distracted
161:16
sidetracked on the wrong path filled
161:19
with lies believing that's how god made
161:22
them but remember when he made them he
161:23
wrote on their soul
161:25
this is who you are this is what you
161:27
will be
161:29
and he had plans for them from that
161:30
moment i will tell you this there is a
161:32
move coming to them and millions of them
161:34
will get born again
161:35
[Applause]
161:35
[Music]
161:42
not not not just a few millions
161:45
he'll move on them they'll know who they
161:46
will they'll know the entire time it was
161:48
a lie
161:51
and they will repent from it reject it
161:53
completely and run
161:55
into god's kingdom
161:58
and they'll be great witnesses i will
162:01
also tell you this
162:02
millions of muslims are about to expect
162:05
they will experience salvation
162:15
god is still into saving people
162:19
number one thing make sure you belong to
162:22
him
162:24
if you get saved at least you're going
162:26
to have it
162:29
a lot of people have it happen on their
162:30
deathbed
162:32
and the family member said i never saw
162:33
it happen so you think it didn't happen
162:36
did you believe they would be because
162:39
the number
162:40
one thing besides getting jesus you
162:41
better believing that your family
162:42
members will know jesus christ
162:44
give their life to him and be with you
162:46
in heaven
162:48
there's a reason why you should do that
162:51
you have the greatest influence in the
162:52
spirit realm over their life
162:54
as family members
162:58
and jesus the first time he took me to
163:00
heaven said there'd be so many in the
163:01
earth to be shocked when they get there
163:02
to see who's up there
163:06
and yet they were the very one who
163:08
prayed and believed for their salvation
163:12
we have so many promises as a believer
163:18
we as the body of will see an example
163:23
a living walking breathing
163:26
taking authority dominion releasing life
163:29
to people
163:30
and let them see you happy and joyful
163:34
while you're doing it
163:37
maybe they might want jesus
163:41
one of the biggest things i know it will
163:43
happen eventually the world will know
163:44
us the body of christ by our what our
163:47
love for each other
163:50
stop fighting the plan of the enemy
163:55
divide and conquer is his plan
163:59
and in this whole last year several
164:02
years before the virus
164:06
it's not a plague
164:09
and it is not a disease even in the
164:12
natural
164:13
viruses come and they go
164:18
but people act like they are
164:22
i'm not saying you can't protect
164:23
yourself if you want to
164:25
i'm not tolerating sickness or disease
164:29
i'm not tolerating it every time you
164:32
bless your food i hope you're blessing
164:33
your food
164:34
i won't ask for a show of hands
164:39
my daddy let us eat after we blessed our
164:42
food
164:43
and then he added things the prayer went
164:45
on forever
164:49
i know where he got it from because when
164:50
his mom came off the mission field she
164:52
would have a 40-minute prayer at the
164:53
dinner
164:57
and she knew that open her eyes if
164:58
you're going to leave the table
165:01
and then she'd pray for you
165:05
blessing your food is a very powerful
165:07
thing
165:09
because it says when you do that and you
165:11
ask he will take sickness
165:13
far from you
165:15
[Music]
165:17
so if you haven't been doing it do it
165:20
that means he won't allow it to come to
165:23
you or your home that's what you've got
165:24
an interpretation
165:25
he won't allow it to come to you or your
165:27
home if you were declaring that
165:30
when i say my blessing is not 30 minutes
165:32
long but you know i added a few things
165:35
i will hold my plate up in the
165:36
restaurant or anywhere else look at
165:37
father doesn't this smell good
165:42
i'm going to enjoy every bite of it
165:45
so bless it to my body and may the isis
165:48
have a never-ending crisis
165:51
may hell have triple trouble in hell
165:54
as long as i'm alive i thank you for
165:58
blessing all those who serve you who
165:59
know you who
166:00
love you amen
166:05
so if we go out together after i'm
166:07
invited
166:08
and that pastor says will you bless the
166:10
food
166:11
who's ever with me will go okay
166:16
and what are they gonna do here i'm
166:18
picking up my plate are they gonna sit
166:20
there and just stare at theirs
166:21
lift it up everybody
166:24
[Applause]
166:25
i'm training you to bless your food
166:31
that you actually can have food and
166:33
actually can eat the food
166:37
amen many countries can't do that
166:40
but we can remember that the next time
166:43
somebody asks you to say blessing
166:46
i challenge you to do it do you know why
166:50
because it was a day when i was in my
166:53
late teens and i was saying my wrote
166:55
prayer
166:55
father thank you for this blessing he's
166:57
in my body and what's wrong with his
166:58
name my person thank you amen
167:00
did you even hear those words and i
167:03
literally heard from heaven this is
167:04
before he started taking me
167:06
i heard like a rubber stamp wham
167:10
500 billion 260 million
167:13
810 0001
167:16
can you say something else
167:21
that we might actually be excited to
167:23
hear he really said that to me
167:26
so from that day i have never
167:30
blessed my food like that
167:35
it's a habit that's not a blessing
167:40
that's not a blessing it's a habit right
167:45
you need to get god excited
167:49
father i thank you for this amazing food
167:51
it smells good looks good
167:53
i can't wait to see what you're going to
167:54
do with me next i am so
167:56
ready who cares what people hear
168:01
at least they'll know there's someone
168:02
around that knows god
168:07
my little sister gave her famous
168:09
blessing i think she was four or five
168:11
and we were all not
168:15
one of our other sisters i have eight
168:18
sisters and seven brothers
168:21
in an alligator named charlie but he's
168:23
in heaven he doesn't have to live in a
168:24
bathtub up
168:25
but i've seen him in heaven your pets
168:27
i'll go to heaven
168:31
be nice to them they'll remember you
168:41
and they'll talk
168:45
[Applause]
168:47
[Music]
168:50
and i already hear some people's heads
168:52
it's too late to tell me that's not true
168:54
you haven't been there because if you
168:56
did you would know that
168:58
why not did you know
169:02
that many animals actually have a spirit
169:04
and a soul
169:08
go back to genesis and read when
169:11
noah back in the day when my meetings
169:15
would be six hours long i'd do three or
169:17
four i was just like
169:18
like this and i would call let's see i
169:20
called them i have called noah moses
169:23
and adam and then one time i called him
169:26
noses
169:28
because my head was so tired i couldn't
169:32
remember
169:32
and every time i did that everybody
169:34
emailed me i don't think you know who
169:36
actually put people on the ark
169:39
and then we get phone calls and they go
169:40
yeah she knows she blew what
169:42
okay she knows this is moa and moses and
169:44
noah because you know she couldn't
169:45
really remember
169:48
if you go back and read that you know
169:49
what i'm telling this is what the father
169:51
told me
169:52
this is how he taught me like a little
169:53
kid because when i go to heaven i'm like
169:55
eight years old with pigtails
169:58
and he actually talks to all of you like
170:01
children
170:02
man is the one who likes to expound
170:06
and make things totally not even
170:09
understandable
170:11
or approachable
170:14
but god doesn't talk to us like that so
170:16
he talked me said i'm going to teach you
170:18
something
170:19
and why because i'd seen pets in heaven
170:21
and i'm like wow there's
170:23
every one of my pets they were in this
170:24
long line and they were on my father's
170:26
ranch in heaven
170:28
and they started with sally the pig and
170:30
i got i got corrected because i said
170:32
there was
170:32
pork in heaven i didn't say he ate the
170:34
pig
170:37
he was a family pet gave him to my
170:39
father when he was tight for the
170:40
ministry it was this big when it died it
170:41
was 1100 pounds
170:45
i saw her in heaven and her were two
170:47
little mice that we had in new york city
170:49
when you were allowed to have pets
170:50
they lived in the wall they were
170:51
residents so we just kept them
170:57
i recognized my brother joey's duck name
171:00
max that he had when he was nine charlie
171:03
the alligator
171:04
that i've always talked about we all had
171:06
in florida we live in florida
171:07
and he lived in our bathtub and we had
171:09
to take it out and clean the tub and
171:11
he'd wander around the bathroom
171:15
every goat bird fish
171:19
snake lots of them spiders and iguana
171:22
named iggy
171:23
i saw every single one of them in heaven
171:28
every one of them a long line as long as
171:29
you see following my dad
171:31
walking around on my dad's ranch
171:34
and the father took me to the store and
171:35
he said i need to explain this to you
171:37
because people will argue
171:38
and they're not god
171:42
so they think they know better than me
171:44
but if you go read
171:46
the scripture in genesis where i told
171:49
noah to put the animals on the
171:53
ark and then he took me further
171:57
you know even closer further away at the
172:00
beginning
172:01
of time when he made adam
172:04
and it talks about how you know god the
172:06
father and jesus were both there by the
172:08
way
172:09
the father said adam jesus stepped out
172:11
of him that's what the word always did
172:13
he stepped out and made his body
172:15
but there was no life in him until he
172:16
did one thing
172:18
the father leans over because the father
172:20
carries
172:21
life he leaned over and breathed
172:24
adam's spirit of life that was his
172:28
spirit man he breathed adam's spiritual
172:32
body
172:33
into his nostrils and he became a living
172:35
soul
172:36
and i went oh yeah i've always known
172:38
that
172:39
he said but you didn't never connect it
172:41
to noah go back and read this scripture
172:43
in genesis
172:45
and i did and do you know what it says
172:47
that god told noah to put every animal
172:49
on the ark
172:50
that had a spirit of life in it you
172:56
don't have to believe me believe the
172:57
word
172:58
that meant those creatures had souls
173:02
and a spirit body oh that's from god i
173:05
can't take credit
173:07
that's how revelation happens it changes
173:09
the way you think
173:10
so people will argue with you it's too
173:12
late it's in the word
173:15
so i don't think mosquitoes have a soul
173:16
i think they just they go die and go to
173:18
hell with the flies
173:29
they came from hell they can't have a
173:31
soul right
173:34
but i did learn that all your pets go to
173:37
heaven
173:38
and then when one would die i'd actually
173:40
see my angel take his spiritual body and
173:42
take it to heaven
173:43
your own guardian angel takes your pet's
173:45
spiritual body and takes it to heaven
173:47
and they live in your mansion
173:50
they will be eating at the table when
173:51
you get there
173:55
they will not be eating off the floor
173:56
anymore so
174:00
people go it doesn't say the word
174:02
animals are in heaven it says creatures
174:06
preach the gospel to who
174:10
what to what i preached the gospel to
174:13
every pe
174:14
i had i was gonna make sure they made it
174:19
creatures remember around the throne the
174:22
living
174:25
they have bodies like animals but
174:28
they're not
174:30
they're highly intelligent have always
174:32
been with god like melchizedek who had
174:35
no father no mother no beginning or ends
174:38
there was more than father son and holy
174:40
spirit i always say father word and holy
174:42
spirit
174:44
and so melchizedek has always been with
174:46
him he is father's personal high priest
174:48
thank you not one of adam's sons
174:52
he's not a human that died and went to
174:54
heaven
174:55
he's always been with him i've seen a
174:58
syllabus this big that tells you about
175:01
um what is it what is that one thing
175:02
they talk about well number one they
175:04
always talk about the stone god will
175:05
give you when you get to heaven
175:07
and you always see on the syllabus a
175:08
river rock with some big long name
175:11
because he will give you a nickname the
175:13
only he and you know
175:15
and that white rock is a white diamond
175:18
is not a river rock the word rock in
175:21
heaven means
175:22
gemstone because he's not cheap or poor
175:30
right when when you get married you give
175:33
your
175:34
the toes a ring with a diamond in it or
175:37
some beautiful stone right
175:39
he's old bran so get ready for your pets
175:44
to be in heaven
175:45
amen and they'll be with you for all
175:48
eternity so i keep telling people be
175:50
nice to them
175:51
they'll thank you for how often you let
175:53
them out
175:56
or fed them the food under the table you
175:58
weren't supposed to
175:59
why do you think they tried to eat it
176:01
off of the table later when you're not
176:02
there
176:04
you spoiled them
176:10
so when he said heaven is beyond
176:11
anything you ever thought or imagined
176:15
it is unless
176:18
i like the word unless it be revealed by
176:21
his spirit
176:23
so the spirit of god is the one who
176:24
catches me up all the time
176:26
without warning me i fall in the
176:28
driveway i'll go to heaven
176:29
i'm in the grocery store reaching for
176:30
something he takes me to heaven my
176:32
family know because they'll come in to
176:33
talk to me and there's nothing in me
176:35
this
176:36
my spirit man's in heaven holy spirit
176:39
climbs and keeps my body alive
176:41
my husband is so used to it of 43 years
176:44
he'll come in and say something to me i
176:46
don't hear him i'm in heaven i don't
176:47
look down and watch what people are
176:48
doing
176:49
are you kidding i'm listening to what
176:50
god is showing me
176:52
but my husband will say these words oh
176:55
i'll come back later
177:00
he is he is scottish he's not moved by
177:03
anything
177:05
even as his wife's body is sitting there
177:07
not breathing
177:10
he is not concerned
177:14
see he picked the right person for me
177:20
i remember the first day he saw an angel
177:21
walking down our hallway
177:25
and he freaked out although i've talked
177:28
about them thousands of times he
177:29
actually saw one he's like
177:35
nothing would come out
177:39
i said oh did you see the angel
177:45
he never doubted he just never you don't
177:48
sit there and cry because he doesn't get
177:49
to go
177:50
he's happy i go and he's happy i speak
177:54
don't ask him if he wants the mic you'll
177:57
get a joke
177:59
and it will be a scottish silk that
178:00
you'll never get the ending to
178:02
you'll never get the punchline
178:06
but if you ever want to fish and catch
178:09
big fish
178:12
that is a gift god gave him when he sent
178:14
him from himself he made him a fisherman
178:17
that's his passion that's his greatest
178:19
thing besides me and jesus
178:20
and guess what i hate
178:24
i hate fish let willy be free
178:28
i don't want him in my freezer in my
178:30
home in a frying pan or on my table
178:34
they're slimy they stink they smell and
178:36
i don't like i don't like them
178:40
so if i went fishing he'd have to take
178:42
it off he'd still be here the jesus game
178:45
and i'm not touching that fish and do
178:47
you think god knew this
178:48
of course he knew it of course
178:52
he gave somebody somebody with five
178:53
layers in their soul
178:55
that's like a rock and you aren't ever
178:59
changing that man i'm glad he knows
179:01
jesus that's all i can say
179:04
loves jesus he hears very clearly gives
179:07
me words from god all the time a little
179:08
scratches of paper
179:10
but doesn't talk about it so he gave me
179:13
somebody who doesn't care about talking
179:15
or want to talk thank god right because
179:17
we'd be wearing each other out
179:20
i pray for people spouses want to see
179:22
they both minister
179:24
and they're wanting the microphone
179:30
[Applause]
179:33
i have no competition
179:42
yeah well my sister kind of makes up for
179:43
her
179:45
the baby who said she'd never talk to
179:47
anybody but
179:48
but taught 15. uh-huh how many kids you
179:51
haven't used to class
179:53
16 two-year-olds for about 15 years
179:56
now she's braver than me i don't want to
180:00
do that
180:02
i don't want to catch fish and i don't
180:04
want that either
180:06
but she's really good at so that's why
180:08
she's writing all the children's books
180:10
and they're amazing our artist is every
180:12
time he gets time he works on it
180:15
every child around the world will know
180:16
there is a heaven there is a god
180:19
and what life is like there and the last
180:21
place i was taken that was new was
180:23
called whimsical way
180:26
it's up in the celestial realm the sky
180:28
of heaven and any little child who wants
180:30
to in heaven
180:30
either climbs into a bubble gets on the
180:32
bubble train
180:35
and takes him up to this amazing place
180:37
parents don't have to go
180:39
and they have all these creatures little
180:41
creatures that are their friends
180:43
and one day we'll they'll be part of our
180:45
amusement park we've made
180:47
so heaven has got lots of plans for kids
180:50
fun you're probably one of the first
180:52
congregations i told this to
180:54
it was amazing these little creatures
180:56
had names they were wearing clothes they
180:57
were friends to these other kids
181:00
and they would all go up there whenever
181:01
they want to
181:03
and play and play and play and have fun
181:06
create little things and then they come
181:08
back down because you live with your
181:10
parents or your grandparents or whoever
181:11
is the closest
181:13
in relation to you when you get to
181:14
heaven no child is left alone
181:19
we should celebrate who we are
181:22
that is your destiny and the new
181:26
earth i get a lot of flack from that get
181:29
over it
181:31
you're not god he's going to make a and
181:34
say new
181:36
say new means new he's already remodeled
181:40
this one several times already
181:42
he has yeah and when you get to heaven
181:45
everybody gets to see when he made it
181:48
you all learn how he made the earth the
181:50
first time
181:52
how it got messed up in verse two think
181:55
about it verse one verse two
181:58
how did that happen so quick in the
182:00
beginning god created the heavens and
182:02
the earth that means it was done
182:04
say don imperfect then wine number two
182:08
is it a mess
182:11
why is the water on the land and the sky
182:14
why is it trapped underneath all that
182:16
stuff
182:18
why is the earth all split up why is it
182:20
in darkness
182:23
the first one he didn't need the sun or
182:25
the moon yet he made him yet
182:28
no he lit it with his glory
182:32
we should study the book of jeremiah he
182:35
turned the light out at one time
182:38
satan was making the earth a wilderness
182:43
rick not me knows
182:46
but really when he made it the first
182:47
time it was perfect
182:49
and he lit it with his glory there was
182:52
no evil on the earth
182:55
at that time and then of course you all
182:58
know
182:59
satan lucifer was cast out of heaven
183:01
down to the earth
183:02
and he thought he was going to take over
183:03
he's tried so many times i don't know
183:04
why he didn't give up
183:07
but the dinosaurs became evil because
183:09
they got possessed and used and
183:11
i know people talk about i don't know
183:12
where they get these things from
183:14
reptilian seed because god made the
183:16
donors dinosaurs not satan
183:18
oh you don't even want to know about the
183:19
reptile you don't need to know about
183:21
okay it doesn't have anything to do with
183:22
us
183:24
man comes up with their own head
183:25
knowledge and understanding
183:27
of something and there are no nephilim
183:30
on the earth right now i assure you
183:33
there aren't any
183:37
so there's too much really to talk about
183:39
all that you've already got what you
183:40
really needed when
183:41
the first 15-20 minutes
183:45
you have revelation that a lot of people
183:47
don't know what's going to happen
183:49
you heard like uh i know 24-year plan
183:53
but really actually heard about a
183:54
50-year plan
183:56
i've been taking over 100 years into the
183:58
future and the earth was still here
184:01
and it was good
184:05
it was really good each generation until
184:09
god is ready to stop things
184:11
it'll get stronger they will manifest
184:14
more
184:15
they'll be in charge more and children
184:17
will probably be the first ones who
184:19
command a mountain to jump into the sea
184:21
and if they want to put it back they
184:22
will
184:24
because we go from where
184:28
this is not glory to glory glory to
184:30
glory
184:31
glory to glory this is us now glory to
184:34
the pit
184:35
glory to the pit glory to depression
184:38
glory to lack
184:39
glory to lack that isn't the way it goes
184:44
it goes from glory to glory to
184:48
glory that is an upward motion in
184:50
authority in dominion in joy and
184:53
celebration
184:54
and the earth being well
184:57
a hundred years from now it will be like
184:59
that so forget
185:01
stop trying to make plans to escape i
185:04
don't want to escape
185:05
i want to be here i'll be here the whole
185:07
time
185:09
and the people well jesus comes
185:11
tribulation comes it's all over no it's
185:12
not you don't know the bible
185:14
because jesus gets he will get his
185:16
thousand-year reign
185:18
and god's not keeping that from him why
185:20
would he
185:21
he's going to sit on that throne in
185:23
jerusalem and be king of the world
185:26
for a thousand years and it's still not
185:27
over
185:29
because satan will be in a big pit oh
185:32
yeah
185:33
there will be no weapons on the earth
185:34
during that thousand years people will
185:36
live to be seven and eight hundred years
185:38
old
185:39
because christ is sitting on the throne
185:42
and there'll still be people who aren't
185:43
saved
185:45
so that means people will make it
185:46
through the tribulation the whole earth
185:48
will not be destroyed in the tribulation
185:51
and everybody won't be killed off the
185:53
earth as there'd be no natural people
185:55
for jesus to rule over when he sits on
185:58
that zone in jerusalem at the end of the
185:59
tribulation
186:00
right yeah who's he going to rule who's
186:03
he going to be in charge of
186:04
and there'll be kings and countries that
186:06
don't want him there can you believe
186:07
that they must have the
186:09
let's be unintelligent i'll be polite
186:13
it's not what my flesh wanted to say
186:15
they will be as
186:16
unintelligent as the devil
186:19
they will not want him and they'll know
186:20
he's the son of god
186:22
i mean he just wiped up all the all the
186:25
wicked evil armies right
186:28
he won like trump won
186:32
not that he's god but look at him he won
186:34
and he thought this is going to be easy
186:36
breezy
186:37
and never has every devil around come
186:40
after somebody
186:42
so harshly they hate him because he
186:45
stands for justice liberty and freedom
186:48
but they really hated him
186:51
when he became really dangerous and said
186:53
i'm fighting god back in january
186:56
that was it
186:59
that was it the devil went crazy
187:03
he's not going to stay in that seat
187:07
i'll impeach him i declare i'm
187:10
incompetent
187:11
other people rise up all over you know
187:13
what they want a civil war here for a
187:14
long time
187:16
they want all of us to run the streets
187:17
and kill each other and i've told them
187:20
i've talked to them sometimes do you not
187:23
understand a true american
187:25
they actually want life they want a
187:28
future
187:29
they have a family they don't want your
187:31
garbage
187:33
go to a third world country and live if
187:35
you want socialism go where they have
187:37
dominism
187:39
we're not going to have it here why the
187:41
people don't want it
187:43
[Music]
187:46
you don't want it and they'll make it
187:48
sound like it's amazing
187:52
make it sound like it's beautiful go to
187:53
venezuela
187:55
they're living in dumpsters if they can
187:57
find one
187:59
that's what happens i grew up
188:03
because of my natural age i've been
188:05
through many generations of time on the
188:08
earth
188:09
i remember the turmoil of the 60s when
188:11
people wanted to have nothing but love
188:13
and
188:14
or war then they didn't want to go to
188:15
war
188:17
they didn't want to do nothing
188:20
i remember that but i also remember
188:22
doing we would do
188:23
these what do you call them when you
188:24
have to do little
188:28
see my earth mine doesn't work so well
188:30
not projects it's when you would hide
188:31
under your desk in case the russians are
188:33
coming to get you
188:35
anybody here have to do that
188:40
you were practicing if you were going to
188:43
be bombed by the russians
188:45
what's called the cold war it's pretty
188:48
cold on that floor under my desk
188:51
and when i was like eight nine ten they
188:53
all did it they'd they'd stop
188:56
and they would let the alarm go
188:57
everybody would just
188:59
buy habit oh drop what you're doing
189:01
crawl under your desk and hide
189:03
in case the bomb would hit
189:06
we lived like that until it was ended
189:12
okay so you don't want to live in russia
189:14
i've been there
189:16
the sadness is so horrific
189:20
i didn't i didn't get off the ship to go
189:22
unsure i could
189:23
feel it and see it like black clouds of
189:26
evil
189:28
and that i could feel with the people
189:30
with a great deep sadness and grief
189:33
that they had no freedom
189:36
because if they take your weapons
189:39
the criminals aren't going to give up
189:41
theirs
189:43
you wonder where their heads are right
189:46
and who
189:46
in the world wants to do well i know
189:48
this is political well you have to give
189:49
it up because tomorrow that's what
189:50
you're really going to get
189:54
god is very politically minded
189:57
he doesn't want that he only wants that
190:00
who in the right mind shows you they
190:02
probably don't have one anymore
190:04
wants to defund the police
190:09
i'd be amazed if anyone who lived in
190:11
california
190:12
or washington or oregon or
190:15
new york chicago
190:18
i could just go down this list who in
190:20
their mind
190:21
having had no freedom for five months
190:26
would vote in that same governor
190:30
or the senators or the people who didn't
190:33
care if their places were being
190:34
destroyed
190:37
where does that come from
190:42
i promise you i won't tell you some
190:44
things the president's going to do as
190:45
soon as he gets reelected
190:48
he'll be tweaking some governors i'll
190:50
just say that much and some mayors
190:54
and getting laws changed
190:55
[Music]
190:59
because people even the ones who voted
191:01
him and don't
191:03
want them now because they who won't
191:06
allow
191:07
are having all the freedom they want to
191:08
do what they want to
191:10
and they're openly showing what's in
191:12
their soul that's the point of all this
191:15
god is exposing the souls of people
191:18
and they can hide and smile behind their
191:20
big office
191:21
but when it comes push to shove what's
191:24
in that soul is coming out and people
191:27
couldn't believe it when it started
191:28
happening what is wrong with those
191:30
people are they insane
191:32
because their people don't have liberty
191:33
freedom and there is no justice there is
191:35
no protection
191:37
there's no food there's no jobs people's
191:40
houses get broken into when they want to
191:41
do you know how many people i want to
191:42
tell you how many people have moved to
191:45
florida
191:47
we are being crushed with people every
191:50
day
191:51
because they were seeing us on the news
191:54
having liberty freedom and justice
191:58
enjoying our beaches
192:02
we were as good as we could be to work
192:04
along with the quarantine
192:06
but we had fresh air everywhere we went
192:08
you could open your door and have fresh
192:09
air
192:10
and people saw that and went i'm not
192:12
staying here no more so they're moving
192:13
out
192:15
and that should obviously we think would
192:17
show the head of that person who's in
192:19
charge
192:20
they don't like this they're leaving
192:23
that means no votes
192:26
now no one's going to want to vote them
192:27
back in you want to go through that
192:30
again
192:32
and no tax money you're right no tax
192:34
money to take care of anything
192:37
it's a mess
192:41
it's all free if they say give it up
192:44
give it all there give it all to us
192:46
we'll just take care of you don't even
192:48
think that's what's going to happen
192:51
you gave away your destiny your future
192:53
your home your rights
192:55
your rights your rights your rights
192:58
ask what satan wants
193:02
but he's not going to get away with it
193:03
here say where to go
193:14
so people have a lot of questions they'd
193:16
like to ask me
193:17
and we'd be here for 10 more hours
193:21
and i wouldn't be sleeping
193:25
people always invite me then if they
193:27
ever ask me to visit their home
193:30
they try so hard to stay up while i'm up
193:32
and they're like falling asleep
193:34
sitting next to me wanting to ask i
193:36
don't do that anymore by the way
193:38
i've actually spoken in i'm trying to
193:41
remember the name of that great black
193:42
university
193:44
it's either maryland or washington dc i
193:47
actually got to go speak there
193:51
oh yeah george washington university
193:53
yeah i did i was invited and they
193:54
couldn't squeeze the people they
193:56
couldn't get them they gave us a small
193:57
room then bigger room a bigger room
193:58
because the students asked for it
194:01
and they have to say yes and they had so
194:04
many crammed in there you couldn't
194:06
hardly breathe
194:07
and the next night there was even more
194:10
and i was staying in the home of this
194:11
family
194:12
nobody could stay up they're like i
194:15
gotta go to sleep
194:18
and i'm still sitting here
194:22
you know in heaven you don't have to
194:23
sleep
194:25
people go i always wanted a bedroom done
194:27
a certain way well you'll get it
194:30
he'll make it for you to make you happy
194:32
it'll be your lounge room
194:35
your meditation room you don't need to
194:39
meditate when you're living with the one
194:40
that you meditate about
194:46
your mansions are amazing some are under
194:50
the crystal sea somewhere up in the
194:52
skies of heaven
194:54
they have a rain forest in heaven these
194:57
12
194:57
massive trees that could hold some i've
194:59
seen mansions the size of new york city
195:01
one one mansion probably belonged to an
195:05
intercessor
195:08
seriously somebody you never knew or
195:10
heard of
195:12
you know they prayed in every move of
195:13
god until they were going on they're
195:15
probably still praying when they were
195:16
leaving
195:18
and i like to tell these young people
195:20
you may be living your life you want to
195:21
but if you have a grandma in heaven
195:24
she's going to pray the fire of god down
195:26
on you
195:28
to send the angels of heaven to pursue
195:30
you
195:32
and talk to the holy spirit non-stop
195:36
you may as well get up here roll over
195:37
and lay down and give up right now
195:39
because they're going to get you
195:43
you'll listen to the prayers of your
195:44
grandma
195:46
i was in a where it was a fireman's sub
195:49
i'll talk anywhere
195:51
and somebody made a comment about my
195:52
hair which god picked not me
195:54
i did not pick this thing here i was not
195:57
a pink hair person oh no remember i was
195:58
the one that wanted to just hide
196:00
i want to be invisible i was okay with
196:02
being invisible he said you're not going
196:04
to be invisible you're not going to be
196:05
hiding anymore that's what he said to me
196:07
we need you to have pink highlights in
196:09
your hair
196:13
now i had probably about 40 pastor
196:14
friends in my city and then they thought
196:16
that was it i went over the edge
196:19
knowing me not changed but my pink hair
196:22
made it impossible to
196:23
to be friends with what is wrong with
196:27
these people oh
196:28
they have no clue they're they're in the
196:30
flesh not the spirit
196:32
this is a spirit test if you don't like
196:36
it you're in the flesh
196:37
you like it you're walking in the spirit
196:44
so i don't ask for it but you can't hide
196:47
so everywhere i go and pastors go i
196:49
can't invite you
196:50
my congregation would freak out if they
196:51
saw your pink hair i said you just
196:53
didn't know how many hours they watched
196:55
of me on youtube and guess what they
196:56
come to my meetings at the church
196:58
next door to you
197:01
i don't think they're not the ones who
197:03
aren't ready
197:06
i think it's you
197:15
so because of this pink hair it opens up
197:18
me to speak about heaven everywhere
197:20
everywhere everywhere all day
197:22
all day no matter where it is it's even
197:25
happened here
197:26
already it doesn't matter people are
197:28
attracted to it while your hair is
197:29
amazing yeah the pastor should hear that
197:31
right
197:32
get your evangelistic team to get
197:34
color-colored highlights in their hair
197:36
and send them out into the streets and
197:37
see how many people they can draw
197:44
it's great marketing
197:48
and so they will say hey your hair is
197:49
cool yeah this is heaven culture
197:52
what does that mean that means i know
197:54
god he asked me to have pink hands in
197:56
his hair i've been to heaven they all
197:57
have highlights
197:59
what and they never say this you're
198:02
lying
198:04
this is what a non-believer
198:07
no matter how on drugs whatever it is
198:09
they'll go what did it look like
198:15
you know their souls kind of loosened up
198:16
because they've been taking something
198:19
and what's in there will come out what
198:22
did it look like
198:23
i've had meetings at the cashier where
198:25
the lines backing up then they're
198:27
listening the bad boys are listening the
198:29
bad boys at the next one cashier comes
198:31
over so they can hear
198:32
well i'm saying it's because of this
198:34
thing here so i understand jesus when he
198:36
said we need you to have pink highlights
198:38
in your hair
198:39
and he can read my thoughts and i'm
198:40
thinking in my head
198:42
why and he looked at me and says it's
198:46
if the lord of glory ever says to you
198:49
with all the love he has his heart it's
198:51
necessary
198:52
i don't care what he wants then he just
198:55
keeps he keeps going
198:57
we don't want you to be hidden you can't
198:59
hide anymore
199:01
we're going to market heaven with that
199:02
pink hair
199:04
we want people to know the truth we want
199:06
to know it's not boring it's exciting
199:08
it's powerful it's amazing
199:09
i want you to know as a believer the
199:11
authority and dominion that you have in
199:13
this earth
199:14
and it's okay if you color highlights in
199:16
your hair you look like heaven
199:20
angels are different colors they're not
199:22
just all
199:23
pasty white glowing with white wings in
199:25
a white gown
199:28
some would probably make you crawl under
199:29
your seat they have a band around their
199:31
head with eyes and that whole band
199:34
they have they have this this whatever
199:36
thing they call this thing
199:39
a breastplate thank you yes they have
199:42
eyes all through them
199:44
in the front and the back their wings
199:46
are made out of electricity or lightning
199:50
their faces are angular their eyes are
199:52
diamond shaped
199:54
if one comes in your room it's not from
199:56
hell
199:58
and some of them can look really fierce
200:00
really fears like i have two heads
200:03
one facing this way one facing that way
200:06
they both look front and back no matter
200:08
where they're turning they can see
200:10
some are weapons they don't need to
200:12
carry weapons
200:14
i'm more acquainted with the army of
200:16
heaven than gabriel's group
200:18
i've seen gabriel's group i know my
200:20
guardian angel i've known him since i
200:22
was little he's 40 feet high
200:24
i won't tell you his name ask god
200:29
would you tell me what my angel's name
200:31
is so i could say thank you
200:33
you're not worshiping him and they won't
200:35
let you worship them
200:37
and an army doesn't get worshipped they
200:38
want commands
200:41
they need orders like this army
200:46
they have generals they have privates
200:48
they have commanders
200:50
all kind of levels in the army itself
200:54
but we get to command because jesus
200:56
christ did
200:58
they were made for us to command they
201:01
don't protect heaven
201:03
not one angel there's not one angel
201:06
building is not
201:06
one was designed to protect heaven from
201:09
who
201:13
from who the army didn't even get to
201:16
throw them all
201:17
out michael held him while god zapped
201:21
him with a lightning bolt from himself
201:23
it says i saw a satan fall as lightning
201:26
well one third of the angels went right
201:28
behind him
201:31
he kicked them all out that was his um
201:36
intolerance no tolerance for evil
201:40
or wickedness he doesn't want us to
201:45
tolerate it either your words your deeds
201:48
what you choose what you say
201:51
especially declare yourself into the
201:53
spirit realm
201:55
how you go get a staff it helps
201:58

202:02

204:25
his absolute power and authority in the
204:27
earth it is our right
204:29
as a born-again believer having invited
204:32
jesus
204:32
into our lives when i was four and i
204:36
asked him in i saw him step in me
204:38
i was four years old don't discount your
204:42
little kids
204:45
i liked it so much when i was five i did
204:47
it again
204:50
so i'm book one i said i got born again
204:52
at four on book five book two hey don't
204:54
tell me there's five
204:56
and book two i said i got saved to five
204:58
and this woman
204:59
who loved everything i had been saying
205:01
and receiving it
205:03
when she found out she said you lied
205:06
this is a legal minded person you lied
205:08
you said you were born again at four and
205:10
you said five you didn't even remember
205:12
i said excuse me i did it twice maybe
205:14
you should
205:19

205:22
in the assemblies of god we got saved
205:24
every week
205:26
we did
205:30
whether we needed to or not we still got
205:32
saved
205:34
oh the baptist did it all the time
205:35
they're doing everybody's neighborhood
205:36
in their yard it doesn't matter
205:38
the baptists are great soul winners
205:40
y'all
205:42
they really are they're very bold
205:48
but don't let the watchtower people come
205:50
in your home
205:56
don't want to give you their watchtower
205:57
magazine burn it
206:00
or shred it it's false religion
206:04
all false religions are run by one
206:06
person that satan
206:08
is called an antichrist spirit remember
206:10
jesus talked about it
206:11
that means anything is against christ's
206:13
sovereignty
206:15
and his his holiness of who he is
206:19
his his anything who's against that that
206:21

206:54
i was recently in um not
206:58
carpenter's home church what was the
206:59
name of the church in orlando
207:03
calvary assembly of god i was there
207:06
invited with a lot of other prophets who
207:08
were
207:08
taken out of their box because jeff
207:10
jensen was in charge
207:12
and he never has a program or a schedule
207:15
you flow with him
207:16
so all these great leaders are all
207:18
sitting up on the platform and
207:20
and jeff would just say all right get up
207:21
there and start speaking and they're
207:23
like
207:23
they'd look at me because i'm a friend
207:25
right he made me sit beside him or
207:27
behind him
207:28
in case i was the only one responding
207:31
here's mike go go say something and they
207:33
go what does he want to say oh well
207:34

207:40
up here and see what he wants to say
207:42
it was powerful and we actually got to
207:45

207:47
done night i think it was released that
207:49
he had was tested positive
207:52

207:57

207:59

208:01
oh when he's done
208:03
it ends when he's done he's flowing with
208:07
the spirit of god
208:10
it was a lot of fun it was powerful but
208:12
most of them didn't know me
208:14
and they looked strange but benny hinn
208:16

you will be blessed and you will never
02:05
stop being blessed
02:09
for i am the god of everybody
02:13
and the god of everything i'm about to
02:16
shake this
02:17
earth great exposure of the darkness
02:22
[Music]
02:22
[Applause]
02:26
no matter what people or the fake news
02:30
or the lying liberals have said about me
02:34
or this time they don't
02:38
know anything
02:41
[Music]
02:45
if they do not stop they will lose
02:48
everything
02:51
their words will become dust and blown
02:54
away like they were never there
02:58
for i say this is a time of greatness
03:01
of acceleration you've never known and
03:04
the manifested sons and daughters
03:08
to come forth to demonstrate to manifest
03:12
my power my love
03:17
my plans
03:20
[Music]
03:22
the devil has plans he will fail
03:27
and he will lose again and again
03:31
and again and again
03:34
and again and again
03:39
[Music]
03:41
for i have already said i will be in the
03:44
white house for 24
03:46
years
03:47
[Music]
03:48
[Applause]
03:49
[Music]
03:53
there is no one on this earth in this
03:56
earth
03:57
under this earth that can stop it from
03:59
happening
04:02
for i will have these days on the earth
04:05
the great days
04:07
the great days of knowing there is a god
04:11
that he speaks that he sears sees and
04:14
hears
04:19
if my prophets do not prophesy what i
04:22
say
04:23
they will not have a voice until that
04:25
season is over
04:28
for these are not the days of doom and
04:30
gloom
04:31
these are not the days of the rapture
04:33
the perilous times the tribulation
04:38
they're times of greatness
04:42
of the fire and the glory sweeping over
04:45
this earth touching everyone
04:49
crushing the darkness and pushing it
04:51
back
04:54
for i am cleaning the stage
04:58
wiping it clean are the enemies camp
05:01
are the enemies people are the enemies
05:04
dust
05:05
[Music]
05:07
for i will have my way my son made a way
05:13
i will not ignore what he has done and i
05:16
will not have a weak pathetic testimony
05:18
of his sacrifice
05:23
no one says when he is coming back but
05:27
me
05:28
and i am not ready
05:32
for i will set you on fire
05:35
and you will demonstrate like no one has
05:38
before in all of history
05:41
the powerful things of god to speak to
05:43
the land the sea in the air
05:45
and it will move
05:48
do not tolerate evil and do not
05:50
participate with
05:52
it you choose life or death
05:57
because they are apparently out there
05:59
right now
06:01
always choose life
06:04
for when you side with those who want
06:06
death of the unburn
06:09
you will never win you will never
06:13
succeed or complete your destiny
06:16
you will repent
06:20
because i bring life and life abundantly
06:25
but you must choose it and if you choose
06:28
it
06:28
you must live it
06:32
get out of the gray area stop riding on
06:36
the fence
06:38
for i hear those who've humbled
06:40
themselves whose heart cries out for
06:43
more
06:45
but this time you get to bring them more
06:50
[Music]
06:54
i said it would be my sons and daughters
06:57
who did it
06:59
there is no age for them whether it's
07:02
three
07:04
or 153
07:08
you choose
07:11
for if you sit on the side and do
07:12
nothing that's what you will have
07:16
a boring life an unfruitful life
07:19
be bold and step out let people know
07:23
what you believe
07:24
and who you believe
07:27
they'll come beating your door down to
07:29
find out about your god
07:32
not the false gods who have no life
07:36
not the lies of the enemy he thinks he
07:39
can take
07:40
my country for it is mine
07:45
i created it i called it into being
07:49
i had people fight for it and die
07:52
for it in the seasons past
07:56
you've died to live for me but it now
08:00
you will live and not die if you choose
08:06
was it what is it to you if i
08:09
keep you until my son returns
08:15
be strong be excited
08:20
and celebrate the victory even before it
08:24
happens
08:29
do not listen to the doom and gloom
08:32
that does not come from me
08:36
but fearful hearts that don't know what
08:38
time it is
08:40
they don't know what my plans are and
08:42
they want to escape
08:48
run your race but run it with me
08:55
for i'll be right beside you
08:58
and i will open the eyes of many and
09:01
they will see me
09:03
and they will know their god those who
09:06
have stood and been faithful
09:09
even under attack even though things
09:10
were taken from you
09:12
do you not think i can give you a
09:14
hundred times more than what you had
09:20
it is my desire to bless you
09:23
it is my desire to be with you
09:29
for there are times there are only in
09:33
the power of my hand
09:36
and these are some of those times
09:43
listen to what is true where there is no
09:46
confusion
09:48
and nothing hidden
09:51
don't believe the lies of those who live
09:53
in sin and say they live and speak for
09:56
me
09:58
someone will remove from the earth
10:00
[Music]
10:01
i won't allow their testimony of who i
10:04
am to be here
10:10
many who are lying cheating and stealing
10:13
and even killing
10:14
will lose not just their seat but their
10:18
life
10:22
this is a holy time but it is a time
10:25
to celebrate
10:28
heaven celebrates with this time
10:32
live on earth like they live in heaven
10:37
but you have to be willing and
10:40
obedient
10:43
the host will not listen to those
10:46
to be commanded by those who do not
10:49
speak the words of my son
10:51
nor have him in their heart not just
10:55
as their savior but as their king
11:00
many kings will come forth in this time
11:04
for my son is the king of spiritual
11:07
kings
11:08
and the lord of spiritual lords in the
11:14
spirit there is no difference
11:15
between male nor female
11:20
both can rise to that position of
11:23
authority and dominion
11:26
but you have to pursue it
11:30
and if you want my thoughts you better
11:34
walk in my ways
11:37
and you better say his will
11:42
his way not his will
11:45
man's way
11:49
i'm about to consume this country
11:54
and people will come here to find me not
11:58
just the american dream
12:04
some regions the light and the glory
12:06
will be so great in
12:07
people will drive their dead relatives
12:10
in there they'll come to life
12:12
[Music]
12:16
neither sin nor crime nor sickness will
12:19
be able to abide in those regions
12:24
you are forerunners it is an honor and a
12:27
privilege to be chosen
12:31
if you're alive and you're breathing
12:34
and you've given yourself to my son you
12:37
are chosen
12:44
know this night that your god has
12:46
visited you
12:48
and spoken his words to you
12:53
if they don't light up with others then
12:56
do not receive those words
12:59
for i stand on my word
13:03
and beside my son on my throne
13:08
these are days we have talked about
13:11
before you were ever
13:12
born before the earth was made we spoke
13:15
of these days
13:17
why would i give them up
13:26
if you buy a bible and it says it's my
13:29
word and it's left parts out
13:31
don't read it
13:35
if it makes it easy to live to freely
13:38
sin
13:40
there's the gods beside me that can
13:43
bring you to my home
13:45
those are lies from hell
13:49
for my word and my truth
13:52
will make you free
13:55
says your god amen and amen
14:02
[Music]
14:04
[Applause]
14:05
[Music]
14:23
[Music]
14:28
oh
14:30
[Music]
14:38
can you hear me now
14:54
[Music]
14:55
i know there are people who will tell
14:57
you that you cannot see the faces of god
15:00
and live
15:02
but even the one who spoke those words
15:05
and they were written in the word
15:07
saw the face of god
15:10
john himself in the book of john said
15:13
you cannot see the face of god and live
15:16
but in the book of revelation in chapter
15:19
4
15:20
he was caught up
15:25
he was in the spirit
15:28
that's a place you walk in
15:34
he was in a place on that day where he
15:36
could hear no word of man
15:39
on the isle of patmos at least that day
15:43
unless he decided to walk off of it
15:48
i chose to let him see things are
15:52
different
16:03
because he was in that place i could
16:05
catch him up
16:07
and stand before my throne with the
16:10
living rainbow moving in and out of me
16:14
with life moving in and out of me
16:18
and he saw my face and never again after
16:22
that did he
16:24
say you cannot see the face of god and
16:27
live
16:30
for i have caught many up and showed
16:32
many my face
16:34
my plans but this one's standing before
16:39
you
16:40
she is my revelator i will never
16:44
stop taking her to heaven what business
16:47
is it to you if i want to
16:51
i hold the air you breathe
16:54
if i choose somebody
16:57
who's been willing and obedient and laid
17:00
down in their life
17:02
every time i asked
17:09
why would i not trust her
17:13
yes she's a woman and she's a king in
17:17
the spirit
17:20
[Applause]
17:24
she's not just my servant she is my
17:27
daughter
17:30
and it is my great pleasure to reveal
17:33
her
17:33
as my treasure to operate without
17:36
measure in these days
17:39
[Music]
17:42
if you're willing to pay the price
17:47
you think it's so easy
17:51
to have to live a halfway normal life on
17:53
this earth
17:54
when you're so connected to me in heaven
17:59
she does not see
18:00
things like you see them
18:05
but she will reveal everything i show
18:07
her
18:09
and will not be afraid of the face of
18:11
man
18:13
even hell trembles when she speaks
18:18
[Applause]
18:21
everyone should be dangerous against
18:26
hell
18:29
it is evil and wickedness that tries to
18:32
consume your country
18:34
but i will not tolerate it for my people
18:38
have humbled themselves
18:42
they have repented of their wicked ways
18:46
and i will heal their land
18:49
[Music]
18:54
for i hear everyone and i see everyone
18:58
nothing is hidden
18:59
from me
19:02
when i look at the earth i rejoice
19:09
i remember when my son and i made it
19:13
we made it to kerry the glory
19:16
the power the
19:23
a wonder station before you come home
19:36
i know your trials i know your test
19:41
if you fall down get up
19:44
[Applause]
19:49
tell the enemy you will no longer
19:50
tolerate him in your life
19:53
that means you will not tolerate his
19:55
images his words
19:57
his frequencies his songs
20:07
you create a habitation for heaven in
20:10
your home
20:12
and it will come
20:16
you will see angels coming and going
20:24
for you are in a new season
20:28
the season of the high call of god of
20:30
your god
20:34
why did you not expect for things to be
20:37
exposed
20:39
before every great thing was done hell
20:42
always acted up
20:47
but this time the exposure is for your
20:49
benefit
20:52
these are not new things they've always
20:54
been here
20:55
you just never knew it
20:59
i'm pulling away every closed door
21:03
basement building
21:06
things hidden in the wilderness things
21:09
hidden in the forest
21:11
even things hidden underground i will
21:13
expose it all
21:16
[Applause]
21:23
the lives of those those who want to
21:26
stand and run your country
21:29
but hate me hate life
21:33
even hate the people they want to govern
21:36
it will not happen
21:45
for i will shake them
21:48
and nothing will be hidden but openly
21:52
shown and dealt with
21:55
even those have already been in power
21:57
and think they've gotten away with it
21:59
[Applause]
22:02
[Music]
22:03
they will not
22:12
trump may not be perfect
22:16
but he gives me permission
22:21
to be in this country from the highest
22:25
office in the land he has welcomed me
22:29
and prayed to me and made friends with
22:32
my pastors
22:34
my prophets my teachers my evangelists
22:41
his closest friends are my sons and
22:43
daughters
22:46
but the world would reject them and hate
22:48
them
22:51
there are many people in this world
22:52
praying for your president
22:55
even they love him even they recognize
22:59
the good in him the authority in him
23:04
he will help to shift many leaders of
23:06
many governments
23:08
so i can shape that nation
23:15
and he will sweep his platform clean one
23:18
day
23:19
to make room for pence
23:23
i have heard words spoken against my
23:26
vice president and i am not happy
23:31
he is a godly man who is not afraid of
23:35
anything
23:38
he is a strong tower to temper your
23:48
president
23:50
he will win two terms also
23:53
[Music]
23:56
[Applause]
24:01
for i have written that in my book and
24:03
what my book says
24:05
it will happen not maybe happen
24:08
[Music]
24:08
[Applause]
24:11
whoever he picks to be his vice
24:13
president will then be president for
24:15
eight years after him
24:19
by that time there'll be no opposition
24:21
that will even have a voice to speak
24:23
[Music]
24:24
[Applause]
24:29
america will be a great light to this
24:31
world
24:35
it is my gift to this world
24:40
who allows my son my greatest gift to
24:42
operate in this world
24:47
get ready because the show is beginning
25:00
[Music]
25:12
there's coming a day when people will
25:14
step into
25:16
a store thinking they're going to buy
25:17
something
25:19
and they will step into my glory and
25:21
begin to cry out to know me
25:30
satan knows about these days
25:34
but he was hoping he could stop them
25:44
this is a place of freedom liberty and
25:48
justice for all
25:52
it is also a place for righteousness and
25:55
holiness
26:00
that your amazing forefathers heard my
26:03
voice and made plans for it
26:08
the enemy has always been afraid of
26:11
america
26:18
don't be afraid
26:23
even if you come home you'll be with me
26:28
there is no fear not even in death
26:32
you just step from life to life
26:40
if your family live here they're the
26:43
most blessed
26:44
people in existence
26:52
plans to be great
26:56
because it is time
27:02
for i will pour out my spirit on all
27:04
flesh
27:09
children will begin to pastor at age
27:12
[Applause]
27:18
five
27:20
children are the easiest to reach
27:22
because they don't question
27:24
and they don't reason and they don't let
27:26
their mind
27:27
get involved that's why i said you must
27:31
be like a little child
27:35
to enter into the kingdom
27:43
you have not because you asked not
27:47
but those who've asked already will
27:49
surely get what they have asked for
27:56
it is a new time on the earth
28:01
a miracle will be an example
28:04
but many countries will run to the light
28:07
and to my son
28:13
for there is a habitation coming
28:18
that will not end until i say it will
28:23
[Applause]
28:28
end
28:34
rejoice that i have shown these things
28:36
and spoken to you of these things
28:41
for those are my plans
28:50
the more you believe it is real
28:53
the more real it will become
29:10
there's coming a day very soon that when
29:13
you come here
29:17
the glory will be waiting
29:26
[Music]
29:32
portals are being opened everywhere
29:38
for heaven to pour in
29:41
but also for blessings to pour in
29:55
those who say i cannot speak through the
29:58
voice of a man
30:00
or mankind don't know me
30:10
make sure you laugh
30:14
laughter is the language of heaven
30:19
but profanity is the language of hell
30:24
don't let those words be in your mouth
30:27
in your home
30:31
allowed to enter into your home
30:34
guard your soul and the souls of your
30:37
children
30:39
by not letting anything pass
30:43
through any form of media
30:48
it will be a trap of the enemy
30:51
of what you've given permission to come
30:54
will come
31:11
if you say good morning to me every
31:13
morning
31:15
you'll be saying it before my throne
31:21
you command the day by what you choose
31:24
when you first wake
31:32
choose life and love
31:36
my power my presence
31:40
extreme discernment
31:48
and get understanding
31:53
these days will come quickly
31:57
and your life will change day by day
32:05
so all who hear this message
32:09
if you are my son or my daughter
32:12
if you have received my son and repented
32:15
of your sins
32:16
these words are for you
32:25
do not walk around
32:28
with your head held down but lift it
32:32
up
32:36
where your help comes from
32:40
even if people laugh they will not
32:44
be laughing for long
32:50
pray for those who have chosen the
32:52
darkness
32:53
and are expecting it to win some will
32:56
take their life
32:57
when they lose
33:00
because their souls have been
33:02
compromised
33:04
by the lies they've been listening to
33:08
guard well the layers of your soul what
33:11
you put there
33:18
and always choose life
33:23
i love you says your god amen
33:41
yes
33:43
[Music]
33:48
[Applause]
33:50

[Applause]
33:57
[Music]
34:18

34:32
it is hard to stand
34:36
i won't fall
34:41
i'm sure my angels are behind me
34:49
i don't want a stool
34:56
what is that
35:02
no
35:08
no but we could just lay hands on
35:11
everybody and end it
35:16
[Music]
35:20
it's pretty pretty hard to top god
35:31
and for those of you who don't think
35:33
this is real may he come to you
35:46
when i walked in the angel of the lord
35:49
who looks just like jesus
35:51
came in behind me to make sure i
35:54
wouldn't fall down before i got up here
35:59
and god's been speaking to me like the
36:02
last several hours before i got here
36:05
and some people think why is she late
36:06
why is she late well are you going to
36:08
turn around and say no
36:10
to god
36:18
i was right on time
36:26
[Applause]
36:32
god was very wise calling me a revelator
36:36
instead of a prophet because he knew all
36:39
the bashers
36:41
wouldn't know what a false revelator was
36:56
he was very detailed with me before i
36:58
started traveling and speaking
37:01
and he'd already warned me about a lot
37:03
of stuff that would happen or would be
37:05
said which
37:06
i understand people don't understand
37:10
what they don't know or they have not
37:12
experienced their self
37:14
it is hard for them to receive it
37:19
seeing is not believing
37:23
receiving is believing
37:33
god has given me many titles i didn't
37:35
ask for any of them
37:38
and many people say i want to be you i
37:40
go no you don't
37:45
you don't really and i've heard people
37:47
say he chose seven men before he chose
37:49
you no he didn't
37:52
he did choose me he knew me when i was
37:56
in him he knew every one of you
37:59
already knew what you would become and
38:02
on your soul that he created he wrote if
38:04
he would be male or female
38:07
no matter how man says how that happens
38:12
and your soul will be conflicted if
38:13
you're told you're something else
38:19
because your soul already knew what it
38:20
was supposed to be
38:25
but if the ones who wanted to take over
38:27
have their way
38:28
they would let anybody choose whatever
38:30
they want to
38:34
but god has a plan
38:38
you were with him before you came to
38:39
this earth before this world was made
38:42
before he stretched out the universe the
38:44
physical realm
38:45
over the spiritual realm that's why when
38:48
it says in revelations he will roll it
38:50
up
38:51
he knows where the ends are
38:55
he had to put something out there that
38:58
he could put physical things on
39:00
because all he had the original realm is
39:03
the spiritual realm
39:05
the unseen realm unless he lets you see
39:08
it
39:09
from the time i was little i was a seer
39:12
i saw the good guys and the bad guys
39:16
i saw activities of the spirit realm you
39:19
hear people talk about angels and demons
39:20
there's much more than that
39:22
all around you there's buildings built
39:24
that both sides
39:25
use depending on what is going around in
39:28
that area
39:30
there's platforms built by these spirits
39:33
of wickedness in high places how do they
39:34
get in high places
39:36
they earn it by hunting for souls for
39:38
the enemy
39:40
these are wicked spiritual beings
39:42
however
39:45
when you learn to command an army that
39:47
was created to pull down
39:49
every stronghold of satan they're
39:53
the ones who war against hell
39:56
no matter what level of wickedness they
39:58
operate in
39:59
they can shred those platforms built by
40:02
these spirits of wickedness in high
40:03
places
40:05
and they go through light buzz saws and
40:08
they can't stop it from happening
40:11
because we who have the flesh
40:15
you're the ones who have authority in
40:16
the earth
40:18
every spirit would be coming from hell
40:20
trying to take over
40:21
they use people like they apparently are
40:23
right now
40:24
but they cannot do it they can't
40:28
the earth is made for men and those who
40:31
receive jesus christ
40:33
you're called to rule in the spirit
40:35
realm
40:36
when you take authority and dominion in
40:38
the spirit realm it then impacts and
40:41
packs
40:41
this physical realm
40:45
and because we haven't known how to do
40:47
it to his fullness
40:48
satan has just taken all he wants to
40:52
done what he wanted to kill who he wants
40:55
to
40:56
put fear in who he wants to we're not
40:59
tolerating it anymore
41:05
jesus clearly said the things i did you
41:07
will do and greater
41:09
things you will do than i did
41:13
so you should be trying to stop the
41:15
storms
41:18
we can help you do that
41:21
you can either email or call our office
41:24
and ask for
41:25
weather warrior information that's god's
41:27
name
41:29
that he gave for this group who's
41:31
willing to step
41:32
out and just do what his son did
41:36
i didn't pick that name we are to take
41:38
authority over
41:39
any form of destructive weather
41:44
and whether you know it or not in the
41:45
word of god when he made the ocean
41:48
and he made the land he told the ocean i
41:51
set a boundary
41:52
right here at the land and you will
41:56
not pass over
42:01
that's god's word that's his decree we
42:04
are his sons and daughters it is
42:06
our job to uphold that
42:10
and tell those storms you will not cross
42:13
over on the land or do destruction
42:15
he created the weather to nourish the
42:18
earth
42:20
not to damage it
42:24
so we sit down here and say god come and
42:26
rescue us
42:28
come and stop this and he's looking down
42:31
saying i gave you authority
42:34
you have authority you
42:37
rule because the enemy knows he can get
42:39
in and twist any of those weather system
42:41
and use them the best he can because he
42:44
comes to what
42:46
kill steal destroy
42:49
and one of the ways he does that is with
42:51
the weather
42:54
so volcanoes are not supposed to be
42:56
erupting
42:57
tsunamis are not supposed to be
42:59
destroying
43:01
none of that stuff that's going on but
43:04
there's been no voice
43:06
or agreement in the body that they would
43:09
no longer tolerate that
43:13
he taught the disciples how to multiply
43:17
food how to travel in the spirit realm
43:21
how to take authority and dominion over
43:24
all the power of the darkness cast out
43:26
any and all demons
43:28
to pray for the sick to be healed why
43:31
are we tolerating
43:33
the virus
43:37
because i'm not it has no right here
43:46
the body needs to wake up stand up
43:50
and step out you can wake up all you
43:53
want to
43:55
he wants you to do all of those things
43:59
and i can tell you right now the
44:01
meteorologists don't know what's
44:02
happening
44:04
they're going wild we even have some of
44:07
their briefings where they talked about
44:09
what is wrong with this weather they're
44:12
almost afraid to give a forecast of
44:14
anything
44:16
because it never happens and then they
44:19
faked it
44:22
they faked it to prove these things were
44:24
happening those weren't even the storm
44:25
that was going on
44:29
those in the area that the storms are
44:31
headed to have the greatest authority if
44:33
you're a believer
44:37
so those on the east coast
44:40
we have melt we have built a wall
44:43
and if you go back and look at every
44:45
storm that's come after
44:47
dorian when we told it we all started
44:50
saying you will not and cannot cross
44:51
over
44:52
the boundaries god set for you and all
44:54
the way down not just in florida where
44:56
we started it
44:57
all the way up the east coast believers
44:58
are standing saying you will not cross
45:00
over and do destruction
45:02
and every time a storm comes you can go
45:04
look at it
45:05
it comes a certain way then it hits the
45:06
wall and goes back out
45:11
and they don't understand it's simply
45:15
the body of christ
45:16
taking authority
45:19
so when we learn oh hawaii has got it
45:22
down
45:25
we have a lot of friends there's a lot
45:26
of weather warriors that live in hawaii
45:28
it doesn't even get started before they
45:29
get out there and they start
45:33
i'll never forget the time that this
45:35
massive like i think was category 5 was
45:38
coming
45:38
and i had been teaching and talking to
45:40
him about taking authority
45:42
and we all declared that this storm will
45:44
not be allowed to come ashore
45:46
and the head of it would be taken off
45:50
and when everyone went to bed except me
45:53
because they don't sleep at night
45:56
when they all went to bed when they woke
45:57
up there was nothing but shreds left
46:01
and they couldn't understand or get it
46:03
because they knew for sure that the the
46:04
island would be consumed
46:07
and those people those whether foreign
46:09
would not let up that prayer of
46:11
agreement we had
46:12
they said we don't know how it happened
46:14
but it looks like the head was taken
46:16
these are the meteorologists saying this
46:19
the head was taken right off
46:21
[Music]
46:23
it was a nothing and one reporter said
46:27
never in 25 years of being a
46:28
meteorologist
46:30
i ever see i never saw that happen
46:33
i'm still trying to go back over all the
46:35
tapes all the information that we've
46:37
accumulated to know exactly what could
46:39
should have happened
46:40
and it didn't happen
46:43
why because they're not tolerating it
46:47
so whoever lives in the gulf better stop
46:50
stepping up
46:53
is not coming to florida
46:57
i live there and i'm not putting up with
47:01
it anymore
47:05
[Applause]
47:08
you need to just get fed up
47:18
what yes
47:22
whoever has the fires
47:28
in your state you better start saying
47:30
you're not tolerating it anymore
47:35
you come into low pressure system to
47:38
form
47:39
and come in and put the fires out
47:44
[Applause]
47:46
that is not something new in the bible
47:49
they called forth
47:50
rain to come and they begin to see the
47:53
clouds form
47:55
did it come and did
47:58
it rain why are we any different than
48:02
them
48:04
it's called believing your faith
48:08
and guess what in heaven you'll need
48:09
your faith
48:11
not to pay your rent not to be healed
48:15
not for any of those things but to begin
48:18
to create
48:21
who is our father
48:27
do you know in the bible when it says
48:29
let us make men in our image that's what
48:31
they look like
48:33
like with the glory on them the light of
48:35
god on them
48:36
but after our likeness is how they
48:39
operate
48:42
we're supposed to operate like them we
48:44
are not god
48:46
you don't want to be god i don't want to
48:49
be god
48:50
i've seen alone but i still don't want
48:52
to be god no one's that many kids
49:02
the devil actually isn't god's problem
49:07
it's how we all operate and stand
49:10
against them
49:13
he should be running does it say he will
49:15
run from us
49:19
do you remember that scripture
49:22
you submit yourself under the hand of
49:24
god and resist the enemy
49:29
what will he do he will flee
49:33
from you he's talking to you
49:36
you do you know the word resist doesn't
49:39
go
49:39
oh no no i don't know what this is
49:42
i will not tolerate you you're a liar
49:46
and a
49:47
friar and i serve the most high god
49:50
only him
49:57
and he'll run
50:01
there are people the demons beg not to
50:04
be assigned to
50:07
because when they come back and they're
50:09
not successful with their assignment
50:10
they get punished
50:13
the devil doesn't give anybody rewards
50:15
not even his own he just punishes them
50:17
when they don't listen
50:19
so they don't want to they'll lie
50:21
they'll do anything they can
50:23
they don't want to and by the way when
50:24
you learn to release the anointing they
50:26
burn and it hurts they'll burn
50:29
if they get near the fire of god it will
50:31
burn them like it's going to melt them
50:34
they may live in hell's fire they don't
50:37
want god's fire
50:40
why baptism and fire is coming
50:43
[Music]
50:43
[Applause]
50:48
see i was raised on the word of god
50:52
god chose when my birth would happen on
50:55
this earth
50:56
he chose my father's my mother's by the
50:58
way my mother is here tonight
51:04
she'll be 90 next april
51:08
she had 15 children
51:12
i am number three and my sister's number
51:14
15 right there
51:18
and any of them could testify to
51:20
anything i'm saying
51:23
i never was normal
51:29
i didn't want to speak to people even
51:31
though i didn't want to speak to people
51:32
i didn't want to hug them
51:36
i just wanted god jesus holy spirit you
51:37
know my little nice
51:39
apartment somewhere and do big business
51:43
he took me out of my world of business
51:46
yeah it's like he didn't know we need to
51:48
pay checks
51:51
seriously he did this he always told me
51:53
before he would do something with me
51:56
my grandmother was my dad's mother was a
51:58
powerful woman of god
52:00
she was in the jungles of panama and was
52:02
afraid of nothing
52:04
ever she'd come to her home on
52:08
sabbatical i mean we had more kids than
52:09
anybody she could have come any
52:10
anywhere i don't remember she had eight
52:12
or nine
52:13
of her own our aunts and uncles
52:16
so she had a lot of children but she
52:19
always came
52:20
to our house because god was there we
52:23
knew she could see through the walls
52:26
we knew she could see right inside of us
52:29
and every time she came she'd lay her
52:31
hand on her head you will
52:33
serve and know the most high god
52:36
and my brother would run and hide
52:40
i'm not going to be a missionary and be
52:41
eaten by the alligators or crocodiles
52:45
no right now they lock him on death row
52:47
to minister to death apprentice
52:48
prisoners
52:50
he's invited by hell's angels to come
52:52
and do funerals
52:55
i don't think he's afraid of crocodiles
52:58
anymore
53:01
my mom would tell me every day you are
53:03
so strange i don't know what god's going
53:05
to do with you
53:08
i was little i ate once a day i slept
53:11
four hours a day
53:13
my whole life i would know things
53:16
my siblings didn't care too much for
53:18
that
53:24
my dad was a great mentor that his own
53:28
mother in the jungles of panama on her
53:30
own
53:30
they had a murderer loose in the village
53:32
i know some of you heard the story
53:34
before but it just shows you
53:35
who she was she was on the mission field
53:38
in the little hut somewhere where she
53:39
was ministering and she i think she
53:41
lived there for i forgot how many years
53:42
many years
53:44
and everybody was boarding up their
53:45
windows to keep this murder from out she
53:47
left her window open
53:50
and she went to sleep right in front of
53:53
the window
53:56
because guess what she knew god sure
53:59
enough
54:00
late at night here comes a foot in the
54:01
window
54:03
and this huge machete coming with him
54:06
and she turn around look at him and she
54:07
goes freeze in jesus name
54:11
and rolled over and went back to sleep
54:14
and three hours later when the police
54:17
arrived
54:18
he was still frozen
54:26
that was my grandmother
54:35
i was taught to never be afraid
54:40
i knew there was a god i knew there was
54:42
his son
54:43
i knew there was holy spirit who is my
54:45
best friend
54:47
that means he'll tweak you 24 hours a
54:50
day that's what that means
54:53
let me speak to you 24 hours a day but
54:55
lots of times he's tweaking you
55:01
he wouldn't warn me something's going to
55:02
happen i don't think i'd do that that's
55:04
what he says to me
55:06
i don't think i'd go there so i'm not
55:08
going to go there okay
55:09
i don't ask him why
55:13
but you have to have your ears open to
55:15
listen
55:16
and it's really good idea if you say i
55:19
choose holy spirit to give you
55:20
permission to get my attention when i'm
55:22
not paying attention
55:24
it is one of the most powerful things
55:25
you can say
55:27
anybody here let's just say it together
55:29
holy spirit
55:31
from this moment on i give you
55:34
permission
55:37
to get my attention when i'm not paying
55:40
attention
55:42
so be it there you did it
55:50
i did that when i was really young it
55:52
saved me a lot
55:53
let me tell you if i gave the mic to jen
55:57
she'd come up here now she would preach
55:58
all the time
55:59
she knows that's true because he does
56:01
the same thing with her
56:04
every morning
56:08
it's called living a new life
56:12
heaven culture isn't just a thing it's a
56:15
lifestyle
56:18
so if you want to live on earth as they
56:20
live in heaven you need to learn to live
56:22
heaven culture
56:24
what is that how they live in heaven
56:28
and living the same way on the earth
56:30
they're free of fear free of lack
56:32
free of grief free of anything of the
56:35
enemy
56:36
never sick they go well they're in
56:38
heaven yes
56:39
they are but our father who is in heaven
56:44
holy is your name your kingdom come by
56:47
the way
56:48
that is heaven your kingdom
56:52
is heaven you're speaking to the
56:55
father right your kingdom come
56:59
your will be done on earth as it is in
57:01
heaven that is heaven culture
57:03
you are literally praying a prayer that
57:05
asks for heaven culture
57:09
and he's released it on the earth you
57:12
choose it
57:15
you lose everything under your soul
57:16
that's not him every trauma from the
57:18
past every wicked evil
57:21
disgusting vile movie you've ever
57:23
watched with your eyes it's in your soul
57:26
it's why he says to guard it for out of
57:29
it will flow the way you live your life
57:32
as a man think it's in his heart which
57:34
is your soul
57:36
not talking about your human beating
57:37
heart the heart also means the
57:40
core or the center of something that's
57:41
your soul that's what you are
57:43
you are a living soul and what you fill
57:47
it with
57:47
is what you will become that's why
57:50
people you've known all your life kind
57:52
nice people i know some of them who now
57:54
hate with a hate i've never seen before
57:56
in people
57:57
they hate and despise don't even know
57:59
why why they listen to the fake news
58:02
and for years they have filled their
58:04
layers you have layers
58:06
whatever you feel the most of is what
58:07
you're going to begin to act like
58:12
so if you don't like you change what
58:14
you're watching
58:16
even what you say goes in your own soul
58:18
so if you don't like you
58:19
you've been telling yourself that for
58:20
years and you put another layer of it in
58:23
you
58:24
and what's in there is what you will
58:25
think about and if you think about it
58:26
you're going to choose it if you choose
58:28
it you're going to do it again that's
58:29
called
58:29
what criminals do
58:32
this is true that's why a criminal will
58:34
get out of prison
58:36
go commit a crime and go back right back
58:37
to prison if they've been there 20 years
58:39
it'll you know why it's in their soul
58:42
and i've been to prison to talk
58:46
it's good to hear that and i had 80
58:49
prisoners
58:50
and they had somebody guards trying to
58:53
watch
58:53
they never watched they listened to
58:56
protect me my husband was with me
58:58
sitting up here staring at every one of
59:02
them
59:05
but then even he was crying and i told
59:08
them how they were sought out by the
59:09
enemy even as a little child
59:11
they had a great call on their life so
59:13
he didn't want them to be loosed on the
59:15
earth
59:16
they might find out who they are and do
59:18
destruction to his plans
59:20
so he gets them into crime this is truth
59:22
he gets him into crime when you do it it
59:24
was in your soul
59:26
then he makes sure they get caught
59:30
and then they get put in prison where
59:31
they can't be a threat to him
59:34
so every time they get up because it's
59:36
in them guess what they do it doesn't
59:37
matter how much therapy they give them
59:39
how many classes they take them to if
59:41
they can't get it out of them
59:44
they'll think about it they'll do it and
59:47
then they're back in the same place
59:49
so i told them the story of their life
59:51
this is what you're doing this is why
59:52
you're doing it
59:53
this is what god had for you this is
59:55
what satan is doing to you
59:56
and will proceed to do it to every
59:58
member of your family if you can then
60:00
they begin to cry then they get furious
60:03
you get mad at the devil then they get
60:06
born again filled with the holy spirit
60:07
then it teaches them how to war
60:10
i teach them how to send heaven's army
60:13
so now
60:14
insider prisons are very dangerous
60:16
people
60:17
who are dangerous against hell
60:24
i mean anybody could go to prison right
60:26
but why are these people in rhythm
60:28
they are dangerous because of their
60:31
destiny
60:32
and satan doesn't want them loose
60:38
your soul is very important to you don't
60:42
ever forget that
60:44
you choose with your soul all day long
60:48
you choose christ right after that you
60:51
should choose what he chooses
60:52
all day long you should guide what you
60:56
choose what you watch what you say
60:59
i love that little saying these half
61:01
years what would jesus do
61:03
what would he say what would he choose
61:08
it's actually a very free life
61:11
to not sin people get shocked when they
61:15
say i don't sin
61:17
oh that's impossible no it's not
61:21
you choose not to
61:25
you just say no
61:28
say no to who was ever asking you sorry
61:30
my soul is too important
61:32
i'm not corrupting my soul they'd really
61:35
think you were weird who cares because
61:38
when they start to die they'll call you
61:39
to pray for them
61:41
they'll look for you if it's on their
61:43
deathbed hey you know about heaven
61:45
i need to go there they'll forget they
61:49
made fun of you
61:52
that's why it's important that you not
61:55
suffer
61:55
trauma for 30 years after it happened
61:59
you know who's doing that the devil
62:02
because you saw it or experienced it and
62:04
he will replay it and replay it
62:06
stop the video stop it stop it stop it
62:11
and lose it from your soul jesus and
62:13
after your will because of jesus to lose
62:15
it from your soul he'll come down and
62:17
pull it out
62:17
and it will literally be like it never
62:19
happened to you
62:20
[Music]
62:21
i've seen too many people set free and
62:24
they went from being
62:26
you know in the dredges of despair
62:28
suicidal
62:29
they'd have these dreams every night
62:31
about the torment or whatever it was the
62:32
trauma they went through
62:34
and three minutes with me
62:37
and the revelation god gave me while
62:39
their husband their pastor went in the
62:40
store to get me some things to eat
62:42
i was invited to speak his wife was set
62:44
free she was a different person when he
62:46
came out
62:49
and then she brought her 17 year old and
62:51
her 11 year old sons to me
62:53
because they were present when she was
62:54
abused so much they lose
62:56
out of all their soul and they haven't
62:57
never six years later i've never had
62:59
another
63:00
nightmare or torment
63:06
you can be free the truth makes you free
63:09
and the truth is you can be free
63:15
even from heroin from witchcraft
63:20
homosexuality doesn't matter what it is
63:23
from the enemy
63:25
you choose with your will to be free and
63:27
yes we pray for people to be free
63:28
from homosexuality which is a spirit
63:32
and guess what they have powerful
63:34
destinies every one of them
63:36
the devil targets the ones
63:40
who have the greatest destinies to bring
63:43
freedom or liberty to people
63:45
and he wants to keep them from doing
63:47
that so he gets them distracted
63:49
sidetracked on the wrong path filled
63:52
with lies believing that's how god made
63:54
them but remember when he made them he
63:56
wrote on their soul
63:58
this is who you are this is what you
64:00
will be
64:02
and he had plans for them from that
64:03
moment i will tell you this there is a
64:05
move coming to them and millions of them
64:06
will get born again
64:13
[Music]
64:14
not not not just a few millions
64:17
he'll move on them they'll know who they
64:19
were he'll know the entire time it was a
64:21
lie
64:24
and they will repent from it reject it
64:26
completely and run
64:28
into god's kingdom
64:31
and they'll be great witnesses i will
64:34
also tell you this
64:35
millions of muslims are about to expect
64:38
they will experience salvation
64:48
god is still into saving people
64:52
number one thing make sure you belong to
64:54
him
64:57
if you get saved at least you're going
64:58
to have it
65:01
a lot of people have it happen on their
65:03
deathbed
65:04
and the family member said i never saw
65:06
it happen so you think it didn't happen
65:09
did you believe they would be because
65:12
the number one thing besides getting
65:13
jesus you better believing that your
65:15
family members will know jesus christ
65:17
give their life to him and be with you
65:19
in heaven
65:21
there's a reason why you should do that
65:23
you have the greatest influence in the
65:25
spirit realm
65:26
over their life as family members
65:31
and jesus the first time he took me to
65:33
heaven said there'd be so many in the
65:34
earth to be shocked when they get there
65:35
to see who's up there
65:38
and yet they were the very one who
65:40
prayed and believed for their salvation
65:45
we have so many promises as a believer
65:51
we as the body of crisis will see an
65:54
example
65:55
a living walking breathing
65:59
taking authority dominion releasing life
66:02
to people
66:03
and let them see you happy and
66:06
joyful while you're doing it
66:10
maybe they might want jesus
66:14
one of the biggest things i know it will
66:15
happen eventually the world will know
66:17
us the body of christ by our what our
66:20
love for each other
66:23
stop fighting the plan of the enemy
66:28
dividing conqueror is his plan
66:32
and in this whole last year several
66:35
years before the
66:36
virus it's not
66:39
a plague and it is not a disease
66:45
even in the natural viruses come
66:48
and they go
66:51
but people act like they are
66:54
i'm not saying you can't protect
66:56
yourself if you want to
66:58
i'm not tolerating sickness or disease
67:02
i'm not tolerating it every time you
67:04
bless your food i hope you're blessing
67:06
your food
67:07
i won't ask for a show of hands
67:12
my daddy let us eat after we blessed our
67:15
food
67:16
and then he added things the prayer went
67:18
on forever
67:22
i know where he got it from because when
67:23
his mom came off the mission field she
67:25
would have a 40 minute prayer at the
67:26
dinner
67:30
and she knew without open her eyes if
67:31
you were going to leave the table
67:34
and then she'd pray for you
67:38
blessing your food is a very powerful
67:40
thing because it says when you do that
67:43
and you ask he will take sickness far
67:47
from you so if you haven't been doing it
67:51
do it that means he won't allow it to
67:55
come to you
67:56
or your home that's what you've got an
67:57
interpretation you won't allow it to
67:59
come to you or your home
68:01
if you are declaring that when i say my
68:03
blessing is not 30 minutes long but you
68:05
know i added a few things
68:08
i will hold my plate up in the
68:09
restaurant or anywhere else look at
68:10
father doesn't it smell good
68:14
and i'm gonna enjoy every bite of it
68:17
so bless it to my body and may the isis
68:21
have a never-ending crisis may hell
68:24
have triple trouble in hell as long as
68:28
i'm alive
68:30
i thank you for blessing all those who
68:31
serve you who know you who love you
68:36
amen so if we go out together
68:39
after i'm invited and that pastor says
68:42
will you bless the food
68:44
who's ever with me will go okay
68:49
and what are they gonna do here i'm
68:51
picking up my plate are they going to
68:52
sit there and just stare at theirs
68:54
lift it up everybody
68:57
[Applause]
68:58
i'm training you to blush your food
69:04
that you actually can have food and
69:06
actually can eat the food
69:09
amen many countries can't do that
69:12
but we can remember that the next time
69:16
somebody asks you to say blessing
69:19
i challenge you to do it do you know why
69:22
because it was a day when i was in my
69:26
late teens and i was saying my rope
69:28
prayer
69:28
father thank you for the soon blessings
69:30
in my body and my swelling was named my
69:31
person thank you wayman
69:33
did you even hear those words and i
69:36
literally heard from heaven this is
69:37
before he started taking me
69:38
i heard like a rubber stamp wham
69:42
500 billion 260 million
69:46
eight hundred and ten and 0001
69:49
can you say something else
69:54
that we might actually be excited to
69:56
hear he really said that to me
69:59
so from that day i have never
70:03
blessed my food like that
70:08
it's a habit that's not a blessing
70:12
that's not a blessing it's a habit right
70:18
you need to get god excited
70:22
father i thank you for this amazing food
70:24
smells good looks good
70:25
i can't wait to see what you're going to
70:27
do with me next i am so ready
70:31
who cares what people hear
70:34
at least they'll know there's someone
70:35
around that knows god
70:39
my little sister gave her famous
70:42
blessing i think she was four or five
70:44
and we were all huh not jen
70:48
one of our other sisters i have eight
70:51
sisters and seven brothers
70:54
and an alligator named charlie but he's
70:55
in heaven he doesn't have to live in a
70:57
bathtub
70:58
up but i've seen him in heaven your pets
71:00
i'll go to heaven
71:04
be nice to them they'll remember you
71:14
and they'll talk
71:18
[Applause]
71:19
[Music]
71:22
and i already hear some people's heads
71:24
it's too late to tell me that's not true
71:27
you haven't been there because if you
71:29
did you would know that
71:31
why not did you know
71:35
that many animals actually have a spirit
71:37
in the soul
71:40
go back to genesis and read when
71:43
noah back in the day when my meetings
71:48
would be six hours long i'd do three or
71:49
four i was just like
71:51
like this and i would call let's see i
71:53
called them i have called noah moses
71:56
and adam and then one time i called him
71:58
noses
72:01
because my head was so tired i couldn't
72:04
remember
72:05
and every time i knew that everybody
72:07
emailed me i don't think you know who
72:09
actually put people on the ark
72:11
and then we get phone calls and they go
72:13
yeah she knows she blew it
72:14
okay she knows this is moa and noses and
72:17
noah because you know she couldn't
72:18
really remember
72:21
if you go back and read that you know
72:22
what i'm telling this is what the father
72:24
told me
72:25
this is how he taught me like a little
72:26
kid because when i go to heaven i'm like
72:28
eight years old with pigtails
72:31
and he actually talks to all of you like
72:33
children
72:35
man is the one who likes to expound
72:39
and make things totally not even
72:42
understandable
72:43
or approachable
72:47
but god doesn't talk to us like that so
72:49
he talked me said i'm going to teach you
72:51
something
72:52
and why because i've seen pets in heaven
72:54
and i'm like wow there's
72:55
every one of my pets they were in this
72:57
long line and they were on my father's
72:59
ranch in heaven
73:00
and they started with sally the pig and
73:03
i got i got corrected because i said
73:04
there was
73:05
pork in heaven i didn't say he ate the
73:07
pig
73:10
he was a family pet gave them to my
73:11
father when he retired from the ministry
73:13
it was this big when it died it was 1100
73:16
pounds
73:18
i saw her in heaven and her were two
73:20
little mice that we had in new york city
73:22
when you were allowed to have pets
73:23
they lived in the wall they were
73:24
residents so we just kept them
73:29
i recognized my brother joey's duck name
73:33
max that he had when he was nine charlie
73:36
the alligator that i've always talked
73:37
about we all had in florida we live in
73:39
florida
73:40
and he lived in our bathtub and we had
73:42
to take it out and clean the tub and
73:43
he'd wander around the bathroom
73:48
every goat bird fish
73:52
snake lots of them spiders and iguana
73:55
named iggy
73:56
i saw every single one of them in heaven
74:00
every one of them a long line as long as
74:02
you see following my dad
74:04
walking around on my dad's ranch
74:07
and the father took me to the stone he
74:08
said i need to explain this to you
74:10
because people will argue
74:11
and they're not god
74:14
so they think they know better than me
74:17
but if you go read
74:18
the scripture in genesis where i told
74:22
noah to put the animals on the
74:26
ark and then he took me further
74:29
you know even closer further away at the
74:32
beginning
74:33
of time when he made adam
74:37
and it talks about how you know god the
74:39
father and jesus were both there by the
74:41
way
74:41
the father said adam jesus stepped out
74:44
of him that's what the word always did
74:45
he stepped out and made his body
74:47
but there was no life in him until he
74:49
did one thing
74:51
the father leans over because the father
74:53
carries
74:54
life he leaned over and breathed
74:57
adam's spirit of life that was his
75:00
spirit man
75:03
he breathed adam's spiritual body into
75:06
his nostrils and he became
75:07
a living soul and i went oh yeah i've
75:10
always known that
75:12
he said but you didn't never connect it
75:14
to noah go back and read this scripture
75:16
in genesis
75:17
and i did and do you know what it says
75:20
that god told noah to put every animal
75:22
on the earth
75:23
that had a spirit of life in it
75:28
you don't have to believe me believe the
75:30
word that meant
75:32
those creatures had souls and a spirit
75:35
body
75:37
oh that's from god i can't take credit
75:40
that's how revelation happens
75:42
it changes the way you think so people
75:44
will argue with you it's too late it's
75:45
in the word
75:48
so i don't think mosquitoes have a soul
75:49
i think they just they go die and go to
75:51
hell with the flies
75:54
[Applause]
76:02
they came from hell they can't have a
76:04
soul right
76:07
but i did learn that all your pets go to
76:09
heaven
76:11
and then when one would die i'd actually
76:12
see my angel take his spiritual body and
76:15
take it to heaven
76:16
your own guardian angel takes your pet's
76:18
spiritual body and takes it to heaven
76:20
and they live in your mansion
76:23
they will be eating at the table when
76:24
you get there
76:27
they will not be eating off the floor
76:29
anymore so
76:33
people go it doesn't say the word
76:35
animals are in heaven it says creatures
76:39
preach the gospel to who
76:43
what to what i preached the gospel to
76:46
every pe
76:46
i had i was gonna make sure they made it
76:52
creatures remember around the throne the
76:55
living
76:58
they have bodies like animals but
77:01
they're not
77:03
they're highly intelligent have always
77:05
been with god
77:06
like melchizedek who had no father no
77:08
mother no beginning or ends
77:11
there was more than father son and holy
77:13
spirit i always say father word and holy
77:15
spirit
77:17
and so melchizedek has always been with
77:19
him he is father's personal high priest
77:21
thank you not one of adam's sons
77:24
he's not a human that died and went to
77:26
heaven
77:28
he's always been with him i've seen a
77:31
syllabus this big that tells you about
77:33
um what is it what is that one thing
77:35
they talk about well number one they
77:36
always talk about the stone god will
77:38
give you when you get to heaven
77:39
and you always see on the syllabus a
77:41
river rock with some big long name
77:44
because he will give you a nickname the
77:46
only he and you know
77:48
and that white rock is a white diamond
77:51
is not a river rock the word rock in
77:54
heaven means
77:56
gemstone because he's not cheap or poor
78:03
right when when you get married you give
78:06
your
78:07
the toes a ring with a diamond in it or
78:10
some beautiful stone right
78:12
he's old bran so get ready for your pets
78:16
to be in heaven
78:18
amen and they'll be with you for all
78:21
eternity so i keep telling people be
78:23
nice to them
78:24
they'll thank you for how often you let
78:26
them out
78:29
or fed them the food under the table you
78:31
weren't supposed to
78:32
why do you think they try to eat it off
78:34
of the table later when you're not there
78:37
you spoil them
78:42
so when he said heaven is beyond
78:44
anything you ever thought or imagined
78:47
it is unless
78:51
i like the word unless it be revealed by
78:53
his spirit
78:55
so the spirit of god is the one who
78:57
catches me up all the time
78:59
without warning me i fall in the
79:01
driveway i'll go to heaven
79:02
i'm in the grocery store reaching for
79:03
something he takes me to heaven my
79:05
family know because they'll come in to
79:06
talk to me and there's nothing in me
79:08
this
79:09
my spirit man's in heaven the holy
79:11
spirit climbs and keeps my body alive
79:14
my husband is so used to it of 43 years
79:17
he'll come in and say something to me i
79:18
don't hear him i'm in heaven i don't
79:20
look down and watch what people are
79:21
doing are you kidding i'm listening to
79:22
what god is showing me
79:24
but my husband will say these words oh
79:28
i'll come back later
79:33
he is he is scottish he's not moved by
79:36
anything
79:38
even as his wife's body is sitting there
79:40
not breathing
79:42
he is not concerned
79:46
see he picked the right person for me
79:52
i remember the first day he saw an angel
79:54
walking down our hallway
79:57
and he freaked out although i've talked
80:00
about them thousands of times he
80:02
actually saw one he's like
80:07
nothing would come out
80:12
i said oh did you see the angel
80:18
he never doubted he just never you don't
80:21
sit there and cry because he doesn't get
80:22
to go
80:23
he's happy i go and he's happy i speak
80:27
don't ask him if he wants the mic you'll
80:30
get a joke and it will be a scottish
80:32
silk that you'll never get the ending to
80:35
you'll never get the punchline
80:39
but if you ever want to fish and catch
80:42
big fish that is a gift god gave him
80:46
when he sent him from himself he made
80:48
him a fisherman
80:50
that's his passion that's his greatest
80:51
thing besides me and jesus
80:53
and guess what i hate yes
80:56
i hate fish let willy be free
81:01
i don't want him in my freezer in my
81:02
home in a frying pan
81:04
or on my table they're slimy they stink
81:08
they smell and i don't like i don't like
81:10
them
81:13
so if i went fishing he'd have to take
81:14
it off he'd still be here in jesus game
81:17
and i'm not touching that fish and do
81:20
you think god knew this
81:21
of course he knew it of course
81:24
he gave some of me somebody with five
81:26
layers in their soul
81:28
that's like a rock and you aren't ever
81:31
changing that man
81:33
i'm glad he knows jesus that's all i can
81:35
say
81:37
loves jesus hears very clearly gives me
81:40
words from god all the time little
81:41
scratches of paper
81:43
but doesn't talk about it so he gave me
81:46
somebody who doesn't care about talking
81:48
or want to talk thank god right because
81:50
we'd be wearing each other out
81:53
i pray for people spouses want to see
81:55
they both minister
81:56
and they're wanting the microphone
82:03
[Applause]
82:06
i have no competition
82:14
yeah well my sister kind of makes up for
82:16
her
82:18
the baby who said she'd never talk to
82:20
anybody but
82:21
but taught 15. how many kids you haven't
82:24
used to class
82:26
16 two-year-olds for about 15 years
82:29
now she's braver than me i don't want to
82:32
do that
82:35
i don't want to catch fish and i don't
82:37
want that either
82:39
but she's really good at so that's why
82:40
she's writing all the children's books
82:43
and they're amazing our artist is every
82:45
time he gets time he works on it
82:48
every child around the world will know
82:49
there is a heaven there is a god
82:52
and what life is like there and the last
82:54
place i was taken that was new was
82:56
called whimsical way
82:58
it's up in the celestial realm the sky
83:00
of heaven and any little child who wants
83:02
to in heaven
83:03
either climbs into a bubble gets on the
83:05
bubble train
83:08
and takes him up to this amazing place
83:10
parents don't have to go
83:12
and they have all these creatures little
83:14
creatures that are their friends
83:16
and one day they'll be part of our
83:17
amusement park we've made
83:20
so heaven has got lots of plans for kids
83:23
fun you're probably one of the first
83:24
congregations i told this to
83:27
it was amazing these little creatures
83:28
had names they were wearing clothes they
83:30
were friends to these other kids
83:33
and they would all go up there whenever
83:34
they want to
83:36
and play and play and play and have fun
83:39
create little things and then they come
83:41
back down
83:42
because you live with your parents or
83:43
your grandparents or whoever is the
83:44
closest
83:45
in relation to you when you get to
83:47
heaven no child is left alone
83:52
we should celebrate who we are that is
83:55
your destiny
83:58
and the new earth i get a lot of flack
84:01
from that get over it
84:04
you're not god he's going to make a
84:07
and say new say new means new
84:11
he's already remodeled this one several
84:13
times already
84:15
he has yeah and when you get to heaven
84:18
everybody gets to see when he made it
84:21
you all learn how he made the earth the
84:23
first time
84:25
how it got messed up in verse two think
84:28
about it verse one verse two
84:30
how did that happen so quick in the
84:33
beginning god created the heavens and
84:35
the earth that means it was done
84:37
say don imperfect then wine number two
84:41
is it a mess
84:44
why is the water on the land and the sky
84:47
why is it trapped underneath all that
84:49
stuff
84:50
why is the earth all split up why is it
84:53
in darkness
84:56
the first one he didn't need the son or
84:58
the moon yet he made him yet
85:01
no he lit it with his glory
85:05
we should study the book of jeremiah he
85:08
turned the light out at one time
85:10
satan was making the earth a wilderness
85:16
rick knocking nose but really when he
85:19
made it the first time it was perfect
85:22
and he lit it with his glory there was
85:25
no evil on the earth
85:28
at that time and then of course you all
85:31
know
85:31
satan lucifer was cast out of heaven
85:33
down to the earth
85:35
and he thought he was going to take over
85:36
he's tried so many times i don't know
85:37
why he didn't give up but the dinosaurs
85:40
became evil
85:41
because they got possessed and used and
85:44
i know people talk about
85:45
i don't know where they get these things
85:46
from reptilian seed because god made the
85:49
donors dinosaurs not satan
85:51
oh you don't even want to know about
85:52
their children you don't need to know
85:53
about okay it doesn't have anything to
85:54
do with us
85:56
man comes up with their own head
85:58
knowledge and understanding
86:00
of something and there are no nephilim
86:03
on the earth right now i assure you
86:06
there aren't any
86:10
so there's too much really to talk about
86:12
all that you've already got what you
86:13
really needed when
86:14
the first 15-20 minutes
86:18
you have revelation that a lot of people
86:20
don't know what's going to happen
86:22
you heard like uh i know 24-year plan
86:26
but really actually heard about a
86:27
50-year plan
86:29
i've been taking over 100 years into the
86:31
future and the earth was still here
86:34
and it was good
86:37
it was really good so each generation
86:41
until god's ready to stop
86:43
things it'll get stronger
86:46
they will manifest more they'll be in
86:48
charge more and
86:50
children will probably be the first ones
86:51
who command a mountain to jump into the
86:53
sea
86:54
and if they want to put it back they
86:55
will
86:57
because we go from where
87:01
this is not glory to glory glory to
87:03
glory
87:04
glory to glory this is us now glory to
87:07
the pit
87:08
glory to the pit glory to depression
87:11
glory to lack
87:12
glory to lack that isn't the way it goes
87:17
it goes from glory to glory to glory
87:21
that is an upward motion in authority in
87:24
dominion
87:25
in joy and celebration and the earth
87:27
being well
87:30
a hundred years from now it will be like
87:31
that so forget
87:34
stop trying to make plans to escape i
87:36
don't want to escape
87:38
i want to be here i'll be here the whole
87:40
time
87:42
and the people well jesus comes
87:43
tribulation comes all over no it's not
87:45
you don't know the bible
87:46
because jesus gets he will get his
87:49
thousand-year reign
87:51
and god's not keeping that from him why
87:53
would he
87:54
he's going to sit on that throne in
87:55
jerusalem and be king of the world
87:57
[Music]
87:59
for a thousand years and it's still not
88:00
over
88:02
because satan will be in a big pit oh
88:05
yeah
88:05
there will be no weapons on the earth
88:07
during that thousand years people will
88:09
live to be seven and 800 years old
88:12
because christ is sitting on the throne
88:15
and there'll still be people who aren't
88:16
saved
88:17
so that means people will make it
88:19
through the tribulation the whole earth
88:21
will not be destroyed in the tribulation
88:24
and everybody won't be killed off the
88:25
earth as there'd be no natural people
88:28
for jesus to rule over when he system
88:30
that's owned in jerusalem at the end of
88:32
the tribulation
88:33
right yeah who's he going to rule who's
88:35
he going to be in charge of
88:37
and there'll be kings and countries that
88:39
don't want him there can you believe
88:40
that they must have the must be
88:43
unintelligent i'll be polite it's not
88:46
what my flesh wanted to say
88:48
they will be as unintelligent as the
88:50
devil
88:52
they will not want him and they'll know
88:53
he's the son of god
88:55
he just wiped up all the all the wicked
88:58
evil armies right
89:01
he won like trump won
89:05
not that he's god but look at him he won
89:07
and he thought this is going to be easy
89:08
breezy
89:10
and never has every devil around come
89:13
after somebody
89:15
so harshly they hate him because he
89:18
stands for justice liberty and freedom
89:20
but they really hated him
89:24
when he became really dangerous and said
89:25
i'm fighting god back in your country
89:29
that was it
89:32
that was it the devil went crazy
89:36
he's not going to stay in that seat
89:39
i'll impeach him i'll declare him
89:43
incompetent
89:44
other people rise up all over you know
89:45
what they want a civil war here for a
89:47
long time
89:49
they want all of us to run the streets
89:50
and kill each other and i've told
89:52
them i talked to them sometimes do you
89:56
not understand a true american
89:58
they actually want life they want a
90:00
future
90:01
they have a family they don't want your
90:04
garbage
90:05
go to a third-world country and live if
90:08
you want socialism go where they have
90:09
dominism
90:11
we're not going to have it here why the
90:14
people don't want it
90:16
[Music]
90:19
you don't want it and they'll make it
90:21
sound like it's amazing
90:24
they'll make it sound like it's
90:25
beautiful go to venezuela
90:28
they're living in dumpsters if they can
90:30
find one
90:31
that's what happens i grew up
90:35
because of my natural age i've been
90:38
through many generations of time on the
90:40
earth
90:41
i remember the turmoil of the 60s when
90:44
people wanted to have nothing but love
90:45
and
90:46
or war then they didn't want to go to
90:48
war
90:49
they didn't want to do nothing
90:52
i remember that but i also remember
90:54
doing we would do these
90:56
what do you call them when you have to
90:57
do little
91:00
see my earth mine doesn't work so well
91:03
not projects this one you would hide
91:04
under your desk in case the russians
91:05
were coming to get you
91:08
anybody here have to do that
91:12
you were practicing if you were going to
91:15
be
91:16
bombed by the russians what's called the
91:19
cold war
91:20
it's pretty cold on that floor under my
91:22
desk
91:24
and when i was like eight nine ten they
91:26
all did it they'd stop
91:28
and they would let the alarm go
91:30
everybody would just
91:32
by habit oh drop what you're doing crawl
91:34
under your desk and hide
91:36
in case the bomb would hit
91:39
we lift like that until it was ended
91:45
okay so you don't want to live in russia
91:47
i've been there
91:49
the sadness is so horrific
91:53
i didn't i didn't get off the ship to go
91:55
unsure i could
91:56
feel it and see it like black clouds of
91:59
evil
92:01
and that i could feel with the people
92:02
with the great deep
92:04
sadness and grief that they had no
92:06
freedom
92:09
because if they take your weapons
92:12
the criminals aren't going to give up
92:13
theirs
92:16
you wonder where their heads are right
92:18
and who
92:19
in the world wants to do well i know
92:20
this is political well you have to give
92:22
it up because tomorrow that's what
92:23
you're really going to get
92:26
god is very politically minded
92:29
he doesn't want that he only wants that
92:33
who in the right mind which shows you
92:35
they probably don't have one anymore
92:37
wants to defund the police
92:41
i'd be amazed if anyone who lived in
92:43
california
92:45
or washington or oregon
92:48
or new york chicago i could just go down
92:52
this list
92:52
who in their mind having had no freedom
92:56
for
92:56
five months would vote in
93:00
the same governor or the senators or the
93:04
people
93:05
who didn't care if their places were
93:07
being destroyed
93:10
where does that come from
93:15
i promise you i won't tell you some of
93:16
the things the president is going to do
93:17
as soon as he gets
93:21
he'll reelected tweaking some governors
93:23
i'll just say that much and some mayors
93:27
and getting laws changed
93:28
[Music]
93:32
because people even the ones who voted
93:34
him and don't want
93:36
them now because they who won't allow
93:39
are having all the freedom they want to
93:41
do what they want to
93:43
and they're openly showing what's in
93:44
their soul that's the point of all this
93:47
god is exposing the souls the people
93:50
and they can hide and smile behind their
93:53
big office
93:54
but when it comes push to shove what's
93:57
in that soul is coming out
94:00
and people couldn't believe it when it
94:01
started happening what is wrong with
94:02
those people are they insane
94:04
because their people don't have liberty
94:06
freedom and there is no justice there is
94:08
no protection
94:10
there's no food there's no jobs people's
94:12
houses get broken into when they want to
94:14
do you know how many people i want to
94:15
tell you how many people have moved to
94:17
florida
94:20
we are being crushed with people every
94:23
day
94:23
because they were seeing us on the news
94:26
having liberty freedom and justice
94:30
enjoying our beaches
94:35
we were as good as we could be to work
94:36
along with the quarantine
94:39
but we had fresh air everywhere we went
94:40
you could open your door and have fresh
94:42
air
94:43
and people saw that and went i'm not
94:44
staying here no more so they're moving
94:46
out
94:47
and that should obviously you would
94:49
think would show the head
94:51
of that person who's in charge they
94:53
don't like this they're leaving
94:56
that means no votes that's right
94:59
now no one's going to want to vote them
95:00
back in you want to go through that
95:01
again
95:04
and no tax money you're right no tax
95:07
money to take care of anything
95:10
it's a mess
95:14
it's all free if they say give it up
95:17
give it all there give it all to us
95:18
we'll just take care of you don't
95:21
even think that's what's gonna happen
95:24
you gave away your destiny your future
95:26
your home your rights
95:28
your rights your rights your rights
95:31
that's what satan wants
95:34
but he's not going to get away with it
95:36
here say whoa to god
95:47
so people have a lot of questions they'd
95:49
like to ask me
95:50
and we'd be here for 10 more hours
95:54
and i wouldn't be sleeping
95:58
people always invite me then if they
95:59
ever ask me to visit their home
96:02
they try so hard to stay up while i'm up
96:05
and like falling asleep sitting next to
96:07
me
96:08
wanting to ask i don't do that anymore
96:09
by the way
96:11
i've actually spoken in um i remember
96:14
the name of that great black
96:15
university it's either maryland or
96:17
washington dc
96:19
i actually got to go speak there
96:24
yeah george washington university yeah i
96:26
did i was invited and they couldn't
96:28
squeeze the people they couldn't get
96:29
them they gave us a small room then
96:30
bigger room in a bigger room
96:31
because the students asked for it
96:34
and they have to say yes and they had so
96:37
many crammed in there you couldn't
96:38
hardly breathe
96:40
and the next night there was even more
96:43
and i was staying in the home of this
96:44
family
96:45
nobody could stay up they're like i
96:48
gotta go to sleep
96:50
and i'm still sitting here
96:54
you know in heaven you don't have to
96:56
sleep
96:58
people go i always wanted a bedroom done
97:00
a certain way well you'll get it
97:02
he'll make it for you to make you happy
97:05
it'll be your lounge
97:06
room your meditation room
97:11
you don't need to meditate when you're
97:12
living with the one that you meditate
97:14
about
97:19
your mansions are amazing some are under
97:22
the crystal sea
97:24
some are up in the skies of heaven they
97:27
have a rain forest in heaven
97:29
these 12 massive trees that could hold
97:31
some i've seen mansions the size of new
97:33
york city
97:34
one one mansion probably belonged to an
97:38
intercessor
97:41
seriously somebody you never knew or
97:42
heard of
97:45
you know they prayed in every move of
97:46
god until they were going on they're
97:47
probably still praying when they were
97:48
leaving
97:51
and i like to tell these young people
97:52
you may be living your life you want to
97:54
but if you have a grandma in heaven
97:56
she's going to pray the fire of god down
97:58
on you
98:00
because send the angels of heaven to
98:02
pursue you
98:04
and talk to the holy spirit non-stop
98:08
you may as well get up here roll over
98:10
and lay down and give up right now
98:12
because they're gonna get you
98:16
you'll listen to the prayers of your
98:17
grandma
98:19
i was in a where it was a fireman's sub
98:22
i'll talk anywhere
98:24
and somebody made a comment about my
98:25
hair which god picked not me
98:27
i did not pick this thing here i was not
98:29
a pink hair person oh no remember i was
98:31
the one that wanted to just hide
98:33
i want to be invisible i was okay with
98:35
being invisible he said you're not going
98:36
to be invisible you're not going to be
98:37
hiding anymore that's what he said to me
98:40
we need you to have pink highlights in
98:41
your hair
98:45
now i had probably about 40 pastor
98:47
friends in my city and then they thought
98:49
that was it i went over the edge
98:52
knowing me not changed but my pink hair
98:54
made it impossible to
98:56
to be friends with well what is wrong
99:00
with these people oh
99:01
they have no clue they're they're in the
99:03
flesh not the spirit
99:05
this is a spirit test if you don't like
99:08
it you're in the flesh
99:10
you like it you're walking in the spirit
99:17
so i don't ask for it but you can't hide
99:20
so everywhere i go and pastors go i
99:21
can't invite you
99:22
my congregation would freak out if they
99:24
saw your pink hair i said
99:26
you just didn't know how many hours they
99:27
watched of me on youtube and guess what
99:29
they come to my meetings at the church
99:30
next door to you
99:34
i don't think they're not the ones who
99:36
aren't ready
99:38
i think it's you
99:48
so because of this pink hair it opens up
99:51
me to speak about heaven everywhere
99:52
everywhere everywhere all day
99:54
all day no matter where it is it's even
99:58
happened here already
99:59
it doesn't matter people are attracted
100:01
to it while your hair is amazing yeah
100:02
the pastor should hear that right
100:04
get your evangelistic team to get color
100:06
colored highlights in their hair
100:08
and send them out into the streets and
100:10
see how many people they can draw
100:17
it's great marketing
100:20
and so they will say hey your hair's
100:22
cool yeah this is heaven culture
100:25
what does that mean that means i know
100:27
god he asked me to have pink comets in
100:29
his hair i've been to heaven they all
100:30
have highlights
100:31
what and they never say this you're
100:35
lying
100:37
this is what i'm not a non-believer no
100:40
matter how
100:41
on drugs whatever it is they'll go what
100:43
did it look like
100:47
you know their souls kind of loosened up
100:49
because they've been taking something
100:52
and what's in there will come out what
100:54
did it look like
100:56
i've had meetings at the cashier where
100:58
the lines backing up and they're
100:59
listening the bad boys are listening the
101:01
bad boys at the next one cashier comes
101:03
over
101:04
so they can hear well i'm saying it's
101:06
because of this pink hair
101:08
so i understand jesus when he said we
101:09
need you to have pink highlights in your
101:11
hair
101:11
and he can read my thoughts and i'm
101:13
thinking in my head
101:15
why and he looked at me says it's
101:19
if the lord of glory ever says to you
101:22
with all the love he has his heart it's
101:24
necessary
101:25
i don't care what he wants then he just
101:28
keeps he keeps going
101:30
we don't want you to be hidden you can't
101:32
hide anymore
101:33
we're going to market heaven with that
101:35
pink hair
101:36
we want people to know the truth we want
101:38
to know it's not boring it's exciting
101:40
it's powerful it's amazing
101:42
i want you to know as a believer the
101:44
authority and dominion that you have in
101:45
this earth
101:46
and it's okay if you cut color
101:48
highlights in your hair
101:50
you look like heaven angels
101:54
are different colors they're not just
101:55
all pasty white
101:57
glowing with white wings in a white gown
102:00
some would probably make you crawl under
102:02
your seat they have a band around their
102:04
head with eyes and that whole band
102:07
they have they have this this whatever
102:09
thing they call this thing
102:12
a breastplate thank you yes they have
102:14
eyes all through them
102:16
in the front and the back their wings
102:19
are made out of electricity or lightning
102:22
their faces are angular their eyes are
102:25
diamond shaped
102:27
if one comes in your room it's not from
102:29
hell
102:31
and some of them can look really fierce
102:33
really fierce like i have two heads
102:36
one facing this way one facing that way
102:39
they both look
102:39
front and back no matter where they're
102:41
turning they can see
102:43
some are weapons they don't need to
102:44
carry weapons
102:47
i'm more acquainted with the army of
102:48
heaven than gabriel's group
102:51
i've seen gabriel's group i know my
102:53
guardian angel i've known him since i
102:54
was little he's 40 feet high
102:56
i won't tell you his name
103:00
ask god would you tell me what my
103:03
angel's name is so i could say thank you
103:06
you're not worshiping him and they won't
103:08
let you worship them
103:10
and an army doesn't get worship they
103:11
want commands
103:13
they need orders like this army
103:18
they have generals they have privates
103:21
they have commanders
103:23
all kinds of levels in the army itself
103:26
but we get to command because jesus
103:29
christ did
103:31
they were made for us to command they
103:34
don't protect heaven
103:36
not one angel there's not one angel
103:38
buildings not
103:39
one was designed to protect heaven from
103:42
who
103:46
from who the army didn't even get to
103:49
throw them all
103:50
out michael held him while god zapped
103:53
him with a lightning bolt from himself
103:56
it says i saw a satan fall as lightning
103:59
well one third of the angels went right
104:00
behind him
104:03
he kicked them all out that was his um
104:08
intolerance no tolerance for evil
104:13
or wickedness he doesn't want us to
104:18
tolerate it either your words your deeds
104:21
what you choose what you say
104:24

104:26
spirit realm

107:01
as a born-again believer having invited
107:05
jesus
107:05
into our lives when i was four and i
107:08
asked him in i saw him step in me
107:11
i was four years old don't discount your
107:15
little kids
107:18
i liked it so much when i was five i did
107:19
it again
107:23
so in book one i said i got born again
107:25
at four on book five
107:26
book two hey don't tell me there's five
107:29
and book two i said i got saved to five
107:31
and this woman
107:32
who loved everything i had been saying
107:34
and receiving it when she found out she
107:36
said you lied
107:38
this is a legalist minded person you
107:41
lied you said you were born again at
107:42
four and you said five you didn't even
107:43
remember
107:45
i said excuse me i did it twice maybe
107:47

107:51
maybe you should do it again
107:55
in the assemblies of god we got saved
107:57
every week

108:02
whether we needed to or not we still got
108:04

108:29
watchtower magazine burn it

all false religions are run by one
108:39
person that satan
108:40
is called an antichrist spirit remember
108:42
jesus talked about it
108:44

calvary assembly of god i was there
109:38
invited with a lot of other prophets who
109:40

taken out of their box because jeff
109:42
jansen was in charge
109:44
and he never has a program or a schedule
109:47
you flow with him
109:48
so all these great leaders are all
109:51
sitting up on the platform and
109:53

there's a lot of glory in here
01:35
whoa
01:39
yeah if you have never felt it it's real
01:43
the more sensitive you are why do some
01:45
people fall not fall
01:47
it's not that something i want to do the
01:49
more sensitive you become
01:54
to him to jesus christ the more
01:56
sensitive you become to the holy spirit
01:59
and their presence because he's always
02:01
with you
02:03
and actually they're always talking to
02:05
you
02:07
when you learn how to tune that in tune
02:09
the world out and tune it in you begin
02:10
to hear them
02:12
and it might be that still small voice
02:14
but it's still them
02:16
i always say them you hear me say them a
02:17
lot i said it so many times someone said
02:20
who are you talking about the trinity
02:26
it's not one without the other right
02:30
they've always been they've always
02:32
existed they have no beginning no end
02:34
i like the no end part
02:37
i get crazy questions sometimes like
02:39
will this all end and everyone just stop
02:41
existing and went no way
02:45
that's never gonna happen and you may
02:48
never know
02:49
everything about them
02:53
because you'll always be learning and
02:55
growing closer i'm talking about in
02:57
eternity
02:57
i mean you know you're actually already
02:59
in eternity if you're a believer
03:01
it's not like you're waiting on it okay
03:03
it's just another season of your life
03:07
but while you're here you have all got
03:10
important commissions
03:12
but if you're alive in this time
03:16
you have extremely important commissions
03:20
and one of those will be carrying the
03:22
glory
03:24
a lot of people i won't be talking about
03:26
america obviously thank you everybody
03:28
for wearing your red white and blue
03:32
[Applause]
03:34
the angels are in this room are wearing
03:36
red white and blue just so you know that
03:38
the ones that signed here especially
03:40
because i asked
03:43
would you please wear red white and blue
03:47
god loves the red white and blue it
03:50
represents his son i don't know if you
03:51
ever knew that those stripes what do you
03:53
think that represents
03:56
it really does that's what it represents
03:59
so the red and white and blue is his
04:03
our president is his our country is
04:07
his
04:12
you ever wonder who to vote for always
04:14
vote for life
04:15
say life remember what god said i offer
04:19
you
04:19
you choose life or death but choose
04:23
life right so this time it is about a
04:27
man
04:28
and god chose that man i talked somehow
04:31
god talked mostly last night if you
04:33
weren't here
04:35
we actually heard from god himself
04:37
speaking
04:38
and he does that with me pretty often
04:42
the more freedom in the atmosphere where
04:45
i go
04:47
the greater change you have of hearing
04:49
from him because
04:50
i didn't know he was going to do that
04:52
but he has permission to use me any way
04:54
he wants to
04:56
i hear prophets say well i think the
04:58
word of the lord is
05:00
and what they need more maturity
05:03
it's okay to open your mouth and let god
05:05
speak
05:07
and he does he does
05:11
and he always will do that he loves to
05:14
speak to his people
05:15
but even people he'll speak to people
05:17
who aren't
05:18
his yet catch him up to heaven when they
05:22
come back they want to know him
05:24
they want to know jesus christ i know
05:27
several times where things like that
05:28
happen not in my meetings
05:30
people haven't caught up a few times in
05:32
my meetings mostly when they leave
05:35
a lot of people see their guardian angel
05:37
after they leave
05:38
the meetings and that's okay don't
05:41
worship them
05:42
[Laughter]
05:43
they won't let you that whole thing that
05:47
has gone through the church for
05:48
so many years uh it went from don't
05:52
worship angels to don't talk to them
05:55
have nothing to do with them and and yet
05:58
in the bible itself
06:00
not just the new testament in the old
06:02
testament they actually had a little bit
06:03
more freedom
06:05
because there was no internet there was
06:07
no fake news
06:08
there was no liberals or legal list of
06:10
people who said oh don't do that
06:13
because they didn't know yet and and i
06:16
can't i count on both
06:18
hands how many and some weren't even
06:21
like
06:22
great men and women of god they were
06:23
just people who god needed to do
06:26
something
06:27
and he would send angels why in the
06:30
world do you think they have
06:32
couriers now anyone who's been in a
06:35
courier service
06:37
understands how important that is heaven
06:40
has
06:40
courier angels they're under gabriel
06:43
they're messengers couriers
06:46
they have all types of angels worker
06:48
angels
06:49
uh ones that deliver things some that
06:51
come and record
06:52
things every person whoever got born
06:55
again was recorded by
06:56
angels is that important to god
07:02
it was all recorded and not just what
07:05
people saw with their natural eyes
07:07
but what was happening in the spirit
07:08
realm when you get born again
07:10
the father son and holy spirit are all
07:12
present when that happens
07:16
because the father is fiercely loves
07:19
everybody
07:20
and if you could see with your own eyes
07:23
i know when i was born again i was four
07:26
i knew exactly what i was doing
07:28
i saw jesus step inside of me i've
07:31
always been a seer
07:33
so i would not talk a lot about it to
07:34
anybody when i was real little
07:36
but i'd always see angels and sometimes
07:39
the other guys
07:40
you know so i'm not really afraid of
07:42
them because i know that they're the
07:43
losers
07:46
and they have no power over me
07:49
now i'm not letting them beat me up
07:51
they're not going to kill steal and
07:52
destroy
07:54
anything of mine and that should be
07:56
coming out of your mouth
08:00
it's called ruling and taking dominion
08:03
jesus said occupy until i come
08:05
he didn't say stood on your rapture rug
08:09
so the holy spirit had us make some pens
08:12
that said roll up your rapture rug
08:15
he actually came and said that tell
08:16
everybody roll up your wraps your rug is
08:18
not going to happen right now
08:20
stick it in the closet maybe someone in
08:22
the generations to come might want it
08:24
you need to get your crown on
08:29
it's more important to wear your crown
08:30
than sit on your rapture rock
08:32
because if you sit on the rapture road
08:33
you'll probably never get to wear your
08:35
crown or use it
08:39
we all have crowns when you're a
08:41
believer
08:43
but what you do with that that that
08:45
represents your authority and dominion
08:47
when you get christ you get so many
08:50
things
08:51
but at that ceremony that's what heaven
08:54
calls
08:55
when somebody repents receives christ as
08:57
a savior
08:58
the father reaches inside of himself
09:00
takes a stone of fire and puts it in
09:02
that person's spirit man
09:04
and that's what brings light
09:08
it puts light in your spirit man that
09:10
light can grow and grow and grow
09:12
the more you pursue christ the more you
09:14
obey the more you're willing the light
09:16
grows and grows and grows
09:19
and i can look at people and already
09:20
know what have you been doing
09:23
or yay
09:24
[Laughter]
09:27
some people are never told what you've
09:29
been told what you're hearing
09:31
but but from the moment we receive
09:33
christ that is the first step
09:35
the most necessary thing yes but after
09:37
that you're supposed to run your race
09:39
and go from glory to glory and you are
09:42
more than a conqueror it's not like
09:44
you're conquering you're taking the
09:45
territory
09:46
that christ already conquered for us
09:50
to occupy means take
09:54
authority and take dominion and take
09:56
territory
09:58
because we rule in the spirit realm
10:02
but where you live the ground
10:06
the air any water bodies wild around you
10:09
anywhere
10:10
you have rulership over all of that
10:14
in the spirit realm you have a realm
10:18
it comes with your christianity with
10:21
your salvation
10:22
and also at that time christ also takes
10:25
something from himself
10:26
the anointing he walked in
10:30
this is all scriptural how about that
10:31
this is the best part
10:33
i know the word i was raised from the
10:35
time i was a little baby
10:36
my dad devoured the word and he actually
10:39
lived it
10:40
he loved his enemies like he did his
10:42
friends
10:44
so there was no skin color to us
10:47
they were people that god loved and that
10:49
we cared about very much
10:51
we have adopted members of our family
10:53
from almost every race
10:55
my mom's sitting right there when people
10:57
meet her i want you to be my mama
11:01
so she had 15 but there's like 16 17 18
11:04
19
11:05
we ran out of numbers because they want
11:08
to be a part
11:10
of what we carry it's called love
11:14
so christ reaches in himself and he
11:16
takes a deposit of the anointing
11:19
he walked in
11:23
how do i know that because of first john
11:26
2 27
11:31
you see rick knows the walking bible
11:34
back there
11:36
if you want to know about a scripture
11:37
ask rick
11:39
he knows it and see rick i know this one
11:43
the word actually tells you that it says
11:46
when you receive
11:47
jesus christ as your savior you receive
11:49
a deposit of the anointing
11:53
that lives and it abides in
11:56
you guess what it doesn't go back to
11:59
heaven
12:00
it's given to you for a purpose
12:03
it is a weapon
12:07
and it's only yours it's yours everybody
12:09
has one you're a believer
12:11
but it's a deposit of the anointing he
12:13
walked in
12:14
so the father gives you something a
12:17
stone of fire
12:19
and you put more facets in it the more
12:21
you do the more you grow
12:23
the more you love the more you walk out
12:25
the word and
12:27
and carry the glory your facets the
12:30
facets and that gemstone
12:32
would blind the enemy
12:36
that gemstone also has fire on it so
12:39
here's the father giving you deposit of
12:41
himself when you receive his son
12:44
you get all of this you get all the holy
12:48
spirit is right there all right
12:50
he writes down okay i will begin to
12:53
pursue them
12:54
for me to indwell them but when you're
12:58
born again
12:59
he doesn't ignore you holy spirit is you
13:01
can say holy spirit you don't have to
13:02
say thee
13:03
he's not an it he's a third member of
13:06
the trinity he is also god
13:08
right and they all have their they have
13:11
their favorite things
13:12
like we do their next favorite colors
13:15
favorite foods
13:17
jesus is just really got this serious
13:20
thing about
13:21
sweets he doesn't want deliverance from
13:25
it though
13:28
did you know he has his own mansion in
13:32
heaven
13:34
did he walk as a man on this earth
13:37
doesn't he deserve one
13:39
jesus doesn't live in this wrong room he
13:41
visits much
13:42
many many times he's there most of the
13:45
time he's all around heaven saying hello
13:46
to people
13:48
you know just blinding you with his love
13:50
and his glory but he actually has his
13:52
own place
13:54
and it sits in this field of these
13:56
flowers that
13:57
sing and worship him all the time now
14:00
these flowers are like eight ten foot
14:01
tall
14:02
and you can't see the end of these
14:04
flowers and
14:05
his mansion is made very particular
14:08
because he likes three things
14:11
well he likes celebrations for sure but
14:14
he likes sweets
14:15
right he loves to dance
14:23
he loves being with people so his
14:26
mansion is different
14:27
he's got one massive ballroom in it
14:30
and all along the walls are these very
14:34
beautiful probably made by him he still
14:37
does carpentry in heaven
14:38
all these wonderfully embellished tables
14:41
and all of them have desserts on them
14:52
he was raised on honeycomb and that
14:54
never left him
14:58
he loved going to weddings because guess
15:01
what they always had
15:05
lots of people sweets
15:08
and they danced
15:13
so because your mansion is made
15:16
for you exactly the things you love the
15:19
things you really love to do
15:20
that you love to eat uh places and play
15:23
i mean your mansion i've seen one the
15:25
size of new york city
15:26
so don't think you have a little cabin
15:28
unless it's inside your mansion
15:31
you know he'll do if you really want one
15:32
he'll stick it in your mansion unless
15:34
your mansion looks like
15:35
you know a 50 000 square foot cabin
15:40
most mansions don't have ceilings in
15:42
them they don't need them
15:44
it's easier for the angels to fly in and
15:46
out
15:48
or the creatures in heaven that come by
15:50
to say hi
15:52
if you have trees growing out of the
15:54
floor that will talk to you and have
15:55
conversations
15:57
they come from the friendly forest
16:02
does it say that the trees clap their
16:03
hands
16:06
it does and they really do
16:10
so jesus has a one of the biggest places
16:13
of celebration
16:14
once you arrive and you have your
16:16
welcome home party in the throne room
16:18
and your family finally drags you out of
16:20
there
16:22
schambach stayed like forever
16:26
some people just love being in that
16:28
presence which is a massive celebration
16:32
they don't have funerals in heaven
16:35
they have celebrations and they have
16:37
parties
16:40
you don't need any alcohol you are drunk
16:43
on the spirit all the time
16:48
really people will step over you in the
16:50
streets of gold
16:54
because you're besotted with the
16:56
presence and the all
16:58
and the glory and the glory is one of
17:00
the things i'll talk about
17:01
this really i said god in the red white
17:03
and blue it's really about the glory of
17:05
what god's going to do with america i
17:08
thought i'd share a little bit of heaven
17:10
who's never heard anyone talk about
17:13
heaven like that
17:14
anybody if you've been there a lot you
17:18
would be
17:19
some people are afraid to i have a
17:21
commission i have to share
17:23
i i have a commission god came to me
17:26
jesus christ came to me and said the
17:27
father and i have decided to take you on
17:29
tours of heaven
17:32
that was over 20 years ago
17:35
there's no way i can be normal
17:41
when anyone dies i have a party inside
17:45
the family doesn't call me unless
17:46
they're ready to have a party
17:49
because i've been at funerals and the
17:52
and the ceiling is open
17:53
and the person who died is looking at
17:55
themselves in their casket
17:58
your spiritual body goes to heaven your
18:00
physical body is what
18:01
rest right you're going to get it back
18:05
you're going to get it back it's okay
18:07
it's going to look really good
18:11
and the day the dead in christ shall
18:12
rise that is your body
18:15
and your spirit man if you're already in
18:17
heaven you're not going to miss that
18:19
you can't you get it back first because
18:21
you come in the clouds right
18:22
with jesus you get your physical body
18:25
first and anyone left on the earth that
18:27
is born again
18:28
they get their body glorified so it's
18:30
okay to go home for half
18:32
to heaven for some rnr because most
18:35
people go i'm going to be here
18:37
i want to be here when the rapture
18:38
happens i'm like why are you going to
18:39
know about it before anybody down here
18:43
trust me they'll all know in heaven
18:44
before it ever happens
18:47
so i hope that helps some people they
18:50
miss
18:50
the rapture oh let me tell you they were
18:53
raptured when they got here
18:57
the moment you step from this physical
18:59
body
19:01
the presence of god and the love of god
19:04
consumes your spiritual person
19:06
you are seeing your guardian angels for
19:09
the first time who never
19:10
leave you they actually escort you to
19:11
heaven and they've been with you your
19:14
whole life
19:16
yay
19:20
i've always been nice to mine
19:24
they had to put up with me growing up
19:29
i wasn't bad i just wasn't a real happy
19:32
person
19:34
but anyway no i can see mine i see him
19:37
all the time and when
19:38
when god sends you into something new
19:40
for him you get more
19:43
okay you all have more than one because
19:46
one has to stay here while the other one
19:47
goes home for r and r
19:50
remember what it says that your angel is
19:52
always beholding the face of the father
19:54
that's because one is here and one's up
19:56
there at least
19:57
many people have many and they come when
20:00
you're conceived
20:02
at the time of conception life begins
20:06
because that is when your little spirit
20:07
man is
20:09
brought from heaven by holy spirit and
20:12
he
20:12
knits and attaches that little dot that
20:15
little
20:16
dot of flesh that's beginning to form in
20:18
your mother's womb
20:19
he takes your little spiritual man it's
20:22
still you
20:23
you've always been you just lived in god
20:26
played like a little child somewhere
20:28
about this big this big your different
20:30
sizes
20:31
you have these little shift things on
20:33
you swim in the river of life you run up
20:35
and down on the stones of fire you slide
20:37
down the holy mountain
20:38
you have a lot of fun you ride in and
20:40
out on the rays of the rainbow that come
20:42
out of him
20:44
but you can't go any further you don't
20:47
live
20:48
in heaven somewhere you live in him
20:53
in him we live we move we have our very
20:56
being the prophets and poets of old
20:59
have spoken of these things what things
21:01
when you lived inside the father
21:03
why is he called the father why are we
21:05
called his offspring
21:08
i hope that makes sense to your head
21:11
he carried us he carried us inside of
21:15
himself and he said when i made the womb
21:17
of a woman that's why i put water in it
21:19
so it'd be familiar
21:22
because you lived in him you played in
21:24
the river of life
21:29
he's very focused
21:32
and the father is an extremely detailed
21:35
person that's why he can put up with me
21:40
my husband he gave me was probably the
21:41
only person who ever could
21:43
because he's got five layers to his soul
21:44
he's happy if i love him and feed him
21:47
and he can fish
21:49
he doesn't have any more demands
21:53
and so god picked him before he sent me
21:58
he sent me first four years later my
21:59
husband was sent into the womb of his
22:01
mother
22:02
but god picked us and he brought us
22:04
together and 43 years later here we are
22:08
he still loves me still loves food still
22:10
loves fishing
22:16
god is very detailed
22:19
and focused when he made you and we are
22:22
so
22:23
amazingly made scientists
22:26
still can't figure out how we can do
22:28
different things
22:30
how does our body operate the way it
22:32
does it couldn't without a maker
22:35
we didn't climb out of a slime pond
22:39
the only big bang that happened was when
22:41
satan was cast out of heaven
22:44
[Applause]
22:48
that's about it that's the big bang
22:51
and it's not a theory it's the truth
22:58
nope we have all been from the end of
23:01
the beginning in the beginning
23:03
beginning to the end when we lived in
23:06
him
23:06
because he went there is that what it
23:08
says yeah
23:10
and when jesus was called the word it
23:12
was the father the word and holy spirit
23:15
until the word came to die for us
23:18
and was jesus christ
23:22
his whole life changed i mean everything
23:25
changed he had to change everything
23:29
he was all spirit he didn't even look
23:31
like he
23:32
he looked different with flesh on um
23:34
lucifer did not recognize him satan
23:37
didn't recognize him
23:38
lucifer that's who satan was before he
23:41
fell
23:42
was the most beautiful being in all of
23:43
heaven god put gemstones all over him
23:46
for a reason
23:47
in his wings all just all over him when
23:49
he would lead worship and the
23:51
rays of glory would come from him they
23:53
would hit
23:55
the gems on lucifer and throw that
23:57
rainbow like all
23:58
over heaven he was anointed
24:02
to carry that glory until he decided he
24:05
wanted to steal it
24:09
and you think about how long see heavens
24:11
already had a war
24:13
they understand the angels lost friends
24:16
did you ever think about that
24:19
they've been around together for a long
24:22
long time
24:23
and even though the army is very focused
24:26
on what they do
24:27
the army is the army they're called the
24:29
hosts
24:30
and if you met one they wouldn't want to
24:32
be called an angel
24:36
i know people who have met one
24:40
more than one but the the army is the
24:43
one i'm most connected with
24:45
and god taught me to be a commander so
24:47
you all could learn how to command
24:49
god said command you me what he's saying
24:51
is let me see you command
24:55
when you learn in the word many times
24:58
when it was either the fathers or the
25:00
holy spirit whatever they said that was
25:01
recorded in the bible
25:04
sometimes if you turn the scripture
25:05
around you see the whole
25:08
revelation in it so if you take command
25:12
ye
25:12
me me i will see you command
25:17
that's what he meant but so many
25:20
scholars were freaked out
25:23
that's revelation they were so freaked
25:26
out why would god we cannot command him
25:29
let's don't even discuss this don't you
25:31
ever talk about this in your meetings
25:34
because because and yet
25:37
no ye not that ye are gods they don't
25:40
want to talk about either
25:41
that's with the little g that just means
25:44
you can
25:45
you you inside of you you have the
25:46
ability to command the army of heaven
25:49
only as a believer if you're not a
25:50
believer none of these will
25:53
you're here listening because you can't
25:55
do any of it
25:57
you must be born again to have this
26:00
authority this dominion
26:02
and all these things that god has given
26:05
us
26:05
if he says let's make man in our image
26:08
and after the way we operate
26:10
if jesus said i give you power over some
26:12
of the power of the enemy
26:14
say that loud then why don't we take it
26:20
he says satan comes around
26:24
like a roaring lion and coming to seek
26:26
he can kill steal and destroy
26:28
he didn't say he had the right to do it
26:32
however it also says that he gives us
26:35
mighty weapons
26:36
he gives us weapons they
26:39
that not an it you don't just give us a
26:43
sword
26:43
or a gun you know although it's okay to
26:45
have those to defend yourself so i'm on
26:47
the side of keep your guns
26:50
and there's a reason why in this world
26:53
you know while there's a devil who hates
26:54
everybody and they have wicked evil
26:56
people
26:57
uh it's okay to defend yourself that's
27:00
what makes us
27:01
not a third world country it also makes
27:04
us not communist and makes us not
27:06
socialist
27:09
that's called control that's called you
27:12
have no life and you own nothing
27:14
so those people talking about that stuff
27:16
don't even know what they're saying
27:17
let's send them to venezuela
27:19
or russia let's send them to one of
27:21
those countries let them have a week's
27:22
vacation there
27:24
they come back screaming we don't want
27:26
to do that
27:31
you have power
27:36
and we have the right to rule and reign
27:37
is says so besides the fact that he says
27:40
you are kings and
27:41
priests those are royal levels of
27:44
authority and dominion
27:46
those are spiritual levels of authority
27:48
and dominion
27:49
again if you're not born again you don't
27:50
have any
27:52
this is for the body of christ
27:56
and all they're told is get saved and
27:57
hang on to jesus comes
28:01
and most denominations that's what they
28:03
tell you go get people saved
28:05
bring them in we'll pray they stay that
28:09
way
28:11
we are living examples
28:14
in every sense of the word
28:18
we don't have to tolerate anything from
28:20
hell or anything from the enemy
28:22
you know why because guess who didn't
28:26
say jesus christ if we are joint heirs
28:30
having been in law for eight years in my
28:32
life
28:33
i got a big lesson on what that meant
28:37
and you all know why is it called the
28:40
new testament
28:43
that was his last will and testament
28:47
that is a legal document
28:51
sincerely of your rights
28:55
and your inheritance and your abilities
28:58
and your authority what he put in
29:01
there's what we have
29:05
and they stand up here just read them
29:07
like they're really nice they sing their
29:09
three songs and you go home
29:11
totally unchanged unless you are
29:13
personally pursuing
29:14
a relationship with christ that's not
29:17
who we are
29:18
that's right we're not here just trying
29:20
to get by
29:24
we have given promises by jesus himself
29:28
written in his word and is
29:31
like if you took it to the court of
29:33
heaven
29:35
they would be saying well why aren't you
29:37
doing this
29:38
or saying this or why haven't you
29:40
activated this
29:42
why aren't you using their weapons
29:43
what's wrong with the army of heaven
29:45
are they not strong enough or have you
29:47
not activated them in your life
29:50
aren't you sending them against the
29:51
enemy's strongholds trying to tear you
29:53
apart and steal from you
29:57
if you went up there without asking for
29:59
stuff if you said explain this to me
30:00
that's what you would hear
30:02
well let's just unroll your bill of
30:04
rights
30:06
and clearly explain to you what we we
30:09
should and then how to use them
30:12
it is our job to train you
30:18
you come to get trained if you're not
30:19
trained you didn't get what you needed
30:23
so people say you're going to start a
30:25
church absolutely not thank you
30:27
god in heaven i'm not a pastor one of
30:30
the hardest jobs on the earth think how
30:32
many kids you got
30:34
right
30:39
i already did that
30:43
at home but you have to look at your
30:47
life
30:48
you have to look at your life a whole
30:50
different way
30:51
like what was christ saying what did
30:53
that really mean is that something i
30:55
have
30:56
he said yes and
30:59
the hard-headed man he was given because
31:01
the father said i didn't give
31:03
make it easy for my son then he takes me
31:05
back in time and i get to walk behind
31:07
the merry men and jesus on the way to go
31:09
minister somewhere
31:11
like i didn't have a vision and i never
31:13
dream i don't sleep long enough
31:15
i was there i saw people throwing rocks
31:18
at the tax collector
31:21
this is jesus's merry men following him
31:23
he's trying to ignore most of them
31:26
there is peter trying to yell at
31:27
everybody about what they were doing
31:28
wrong right
31:30
this is exactly what they did patience
31:32
that belongs
31:34
to luke we're running down the road why
31:36
did you give us up for him
31:39
this is reality right he's been a
31:41
physician for a long time he had a lot
31:43
of patience
31:44
let me tell you when you have a good
31:45
doctor you don't want to lose them well
31:46
he wasn't doing that anymore
31:48
he gave it up but they didn't want to
31:50
give him up this is exactly what i was
31:52
showing and i went
31:52
i'll never complain about my staff again
31:57
and this is early on when he had
32:00
his 12. the hardest ones to get roped in
32:05
were james and john the sons of thunder
32:08
that didn't mean thunder from god
32:11
that means they were fighting all the
32:13
time
32:14
over pretty girls who thought they were
32:17
awesome
32:19
they had to get rid of the flesh
32:22
when you think about what they became in
32:25
a three short years
32:28
it's absolutely amazing because no coach
32:30
here on the earth could believe it could
32:32
take
32:33
that many people from different
32:34
circumstances and ages and
32:36
thoughts and everything you know and
32:38
here was the son of glory
32:41
saying i saw you when you were under the
32:43
tree there earlier
32:44
talking and said what he said that
32:47
wasn't normal
32:50
multiplied the foods there was so much
32:51
left over from a couple fish
32:53
which i don't like couple fish and loads
32:55
of bread they could have had mine
32:56
i would have given them mine baskets
33:00
full
33:01
left over now that was not normal was it
33:05
when he disappeared into the spirit he
33:07
stepped into the spirit room
33:09
like this and he walked through the
33:11
people when they were going to throw him
33:12
over the cliff
33:14
he actually said he passed through the
33:16
people you know that right
33:17
people go well he went around that's not
33:20
what it says
33:22
the orthodox jews knew he was a good man
33:25
they thought he was a prophet they
33:26
caught they gave him
33:27
that benefit i know some they think he's
33:30
a prophet and when he was having his
33:31
meeting there after him
33:33
they believe because i heard it face to
33:35
face
33:36
on a tour to israel uh which they hooked
33:38
a mic on me and
33:40
with steve schultz of elijah list they
33:42
recorded every time i prophesied god
33:44
said something somewhere
33:45
and we were at the mount the precipice
33:48
and so this
33:49
orthodox jew was given his spin on it
33:52
and he said yes the crowds wanted to
33:54
kill him they didn't like it that he was
33:55
good and he was doing good
33:57
so they lowered a rope his disciples
34:00
down the side of the mountain
34:02
i saw the side of that mountain
34:06
that rope would have been 250 300 feet
34:08
long
34:09
who's going to carry a rope around on a
34:11
wagon right
34:12
it's not like a little road and i'm
34:15
thinking that's not even
34:16
in the natural and so of possible
34:20
all the believers are like just kind of
34:21
staring at him but that's what they
34:23
believe he let himself down
34:25
no but then it was my turn to give
34:27
revelation on where we were
34:30
and i said well you all realize jesus as
34:33
as the son of god although he walked as
34:35
a man that is true he also was the son
34:37
of god
34:38
but even walking as a man he learned
34:40
truth
34:41
about the spirit realm the unseen realm
34:44
it's a real place
34:45
it supersedes the physical realm that's
34:48
why angels and spiritual beings can pass
34:50
through this wall
34:52
they do it a lot sometimes you see them
34:54
sometimes you don't but they have the
34:55
ability
34:56
but but jesus learned that he himself
35:01
he was headed he had a spirit man inside
35:03
he had a body but he already learned
35:05
that he had access to that spirit realm
35:07
so when this crowd came upon him
35:10
this is all he had to do there are slits
35:12
and openings everywhere
35:14
if you step in you cannot be seen but
35:16
you see everybody around you oh yeah
35:18
like if i disappeared i would see
35:21
everybody here i could hear you but you
35:22
couldn't see or hear me
35:24
so to you i would be invisible
35:27
so what he did was when they were coming
35:29
after him he just probably backstepped
35:32
disappeared and he walked through the
35:34
bodies of the people
35:36
because the spirit supersedes the
35:38
physical realm so he walked
35:40
through the crowds right through their
35:41
bodies until he got where he wanted to
35:43
he stepped out of the spirit realm
35:45
and there he was
35:49
but guess what
35:55
we are joint heirs
35:59
and the things he did the works he did
36:04
we will do also and greater things than
36:07
that will we do
36:11
there's now i won't tell this this is
36:13
going from glory to glory
36:15
there are requirements and some people
36:17
don't like to hear that
36:19
so people who are full of their self
36:21
selfish spewing stuff these are
36:23
christians i'm talking about
36:25
because there's no way now i can tell
36:26
you this the devil knows about the
36:28
spirit realm
36:30
and a lot of people in the new age
36:31
movement have spirit guides those are
36:33
demons
36:34
and they'll take them in there but this
36:37
is the thing this is why they're so
36:38
insistent that that stuff is real
36:41
they had a real encounter
36:45
and because that doesn't mean what
36:46
you're seeing is real
36:49
that's why you must test every spirit
36:54
and almost nobody says that or talks
36:56
about that
36:58
if an angel appeared in this room and
36:59
said come and go with me
37:02
i would say are you the spirit of the
37:04
most high god who sent his son to die
37:05
for the sins of this world
37:08
and they can't lie so if he said yes i
37:11
am the father has sent you i'd go with
37:12
him
37:13
if he said nothing or looked terrified i
37:16
say
37:16
get out i evict you
37:20
get out i have nothing to do with you
37:22
and that's what
37:23
the basic probably one of the most
37:25
important things that every believer
37:26
will ever learn
37:28
when you get born again
37:31
because that's the moment the enemy
37:33
really begins to pursue you he doesn't
37:34
want you
37:35
to be he didn't want you to know who you
37:37
are see then
37:39
then he's losing territory he's losing
37:42
his
37:42
impact he won't have a way to hold on to
37:45
you
37:46
or use you but this is one of the things
37:48
jesus did he did it quite often he
37:50
taught who
37:52
fill up everybody say phillip
37:57
say in the new testament philip
38:01
travel through the spirit realm he would
38:04
appear somewhere
38:06
and then he would be gone he would be
38:09
found in another place
38:12
he traveled through the spirit realm
38:13
just like christ did
38:19
but people who sit in a church with the
38:21
pastor doesn't have an understanding
38:24
of the spirit realm the purposes god
38:26
made it
38:27
and what our rights are and how you do
38:30
this is
38:30
things you do you sent out assignments
38:32
by god and and
38:34
probably 20 40 50 60 years from now that
38:37
might be a normal way of transportation
38:40
let's say you're going to india to
38:41
preach the gospel
38:43
you may just step i don't know i don't
38:45
know how he'll do it you could step in a
38:46
certain room and then when you come out
38:48
you're in india
38:50
that was spirit realm
38:53
you don't need a passport you don't need
38:56
luggage
38:59
and when you're done you probably turn
39:01
around and step and you're back home
39:05
this is our future
39:06
[Music]
39:08
now doesn't that make christianity a
39:10
little bit more exciting
39:14
there are people who are already
39:15
connected with god with holy spirit and
39:18
have an understanding of the spirit
39:20
realm
39:21
these people who just kind of astral
39:23
project themselves out places
39:25
that's something they're doing from
39:26
their own soul it's dangerous
39:30
you're out there with no one protecting
39:33
you
39:35
helping you and you're just bait
39:39
the enemy can send these spirit guides
39:41
if you do that and they'll take you to
39:42
places and tell you all kinds of lies
39:44
about where they're
39:45
taking you and give you a commission
39:47
because you had a real encounter you
39:48
believe that was true and it wasn't
39:53
so even some pastors who know are afraid
39:56
to tell you
39:57
should you misuse it should you misuse
40:00
it or try it or something but
40:01
it is our right to have an understanding
40:04
of who we
40:05
are so did jesus do those things
40:10
and philip he's not the only one who
40:14
travels but john did it all the time he
40:15
left the isle of patmos when he felt
40:17
like it
40:19
you know why they put him there
40:22
he wasn't even in a jail because that
40:24
would be useless
40:27
john they tried killing him so many
40:29
times and they were terrified that he
40:31
wouldn't die
40:32
they couldn't even hurt him when they
40:34
boiled him in oil he probably asked for
40:35
a rubber ducky in the scrub bush
40:39
john was
40:43
sort of like peter at one time but now
40:46
he spoke with
40:46
confidence he knew who he was
40:50
he knew he was under divine protection
40:52
he was afraid of nobody
40:53
so he would say boldly whatever god gave
40:56
him when he went somewhere
40:57
so that would be the best thing we can
40:59
do is put them away from everybody
41:01
on an island
41:04
not realizing
41:08
he was in the spirit on the lord's day
41:11
which means he was in that spiritual
41:13
realm when he heard the voice he looked
41:15
up saw the door open and he was
41:17
up in heaven the spirit realm is a place
41:22
it is a place it's not just something
41:24
you say
41:25
but john who was the closest to jesus of
41:28
all the disciples who never abandoned
41:31
him not even at the cross
41:34
that's why he gave his mother to john
41:37
he had to die as his mother's savior
41:40
not as her son that's why he said mother
41:45
mom this is your son's son this is your
41:46
mother
41:49
he still recognizes that she birthed him
41:51
in heaven she's highly honored
41:52
not worshipped
41:56
she's not she's not a deity
41:58
[Laughter]
41:59
she's very much loved because it took a
42:01
lot
42:03
had divine encounter with angels a good
42:05
thing she was willing to listen to them
42:07
right
42:10
and then even joseph think about that
42:12
that was tough
42:15
when you do something great for god's
42:17
surrender will always be required
42:19
to some people that sounds like control
42:21
and so they're afraid
42:22
and if anybody's ever been in like a
42:25
occult not
42:26
occult occult that's satan's but a cult
42:30
can be a christian cult
42:32
you join it you live on land they get to
42:35
tell you what to do and not to do
42:37
it's still a form of control they think
42:39
they're doing out of
42:40
to help you but it's not some tell you
42:43
who you can marry who you cannot marry i
42:44
know people who were in one of those
42:46
and they will not sign any kind of a
42:47
document for anybody
42:49
because they were under control when
42:52
they got free
42:53
they don't want they don't want to ever
42:54
be controlled again by people so they're
42:56
not a good thing either
42:58
okay you don't need people to take you
43:01
and keep you in a compound somewhere
43:03
and run your whole life for you that's
43:05
not god
43:06
and they love and some of them love
43:08
jesus and they may have their little
43:09
church and worship and stuff
43:11
but they have no rights really
43:15
it's not a good thing it's certainly not
43:18
god
43:19
right so the i've known people who've
43:23
been through that so they don't if you
43:24
say well we have
43:26
uh this we're having everybody to sign a
43:28
covenant with us to be a part of what
43:30
we're doing they won't sign it
43:32
even though it has nothing to do with
43:33
controlling them or anything
43:35
they just won't do it they won't do it
43:37
and i said well i'll just give you
43:38
give you time pray for you you need to
43:41
release all that from your soul and be
43:42
free from that experience you had
43:45
but especially if things hurt you or
43:47
things happen to you and that
43:49
it's not good you
43:53
are responsible for yourself and the
43:55
family god gave you
43:57
and you're shaping i guess my sign to
44:00
take a drink
44:05
all this is coming to one thing it's
44:08
about carrying the glory around america
44:13
but i experienced last night yes god did
44:16
step into me and i had
44:17
waves i felt like this cloud came when i
44:20
stepped out of the vehicle
44:22
a cloud came and just i saw the cloud
44:26
and i heard the father speaking so all
44:28
the way in that's why i couldn't walk
44:31
i didn't feel like i was here most of
44:35
the time
44:36
i didn't feel like even standing there
44:38
if i moved and looked at somebody they
44:40
would go they'd go like this
44:42
and i have only encountered that one at
44:44
the time when
44:46
because this is saying what you're
44:47
willing to talk about to people you're
44:49
going to do it
44:51
he needs voices to speak about the
44:53
things he wants for us
44:55
so they know this is something he has
44:58
right
44:59
if you're living if you're playing with
45:01
sin it's not going to happen
45:03
because you're a testimony right you're
45:05
manifesting for him with these signs and
45:07
wonders and greater works
45:09
and he can't give those to people who
45:11
are going to play in the darkness and go
45:12
to church play in the darkness go to
45:14
church
45:14
and people know that and they see you
45:16
doing this stuff they're
45:18
it's gonna bring confusion so even
45:21
though people have
45:22
faked a lot of things they can fake
45:24
being in the five-fold ministry they can
45:25
fake
45:26
all kinds of things one thing they
45:28
cannot fake is carrying the glory
45:31
or the fire and manifesting for god
45:35
because he'll just
45:36
take everything away so these are
45:39
different days
45:40
these are powerful days just doing the
45:43
works is powerful
45:45
like walking on water right multiplying
45:48
food
45:49
raising the dead who've been dead a long
45:51
time
45:52
you know or just maybe a few days who
45:54
knows
45:55
[Laughter]
45:56
this is what i say if you're dead you're
45:58
dead if he wants you you're not coming
46:00
back
46:01
if these are believers if he wants you
46:03
or if he gives you a choice and you're
46:05
in heaven
46:06
be the hardest thing in their existence
46:11
to be in the presence of the living god
46:13
and his son in
46:14
and holy spirit in heaven itself
46:17
everything is alive there's more life
46:19
there than
46:19
anything ever so when they die their
46:21
body does but they don't
46:23
they step into real life they're very
46:26
much alive
46:30
declaring over you believing for you to
46:33
be
46:34
great for him instead of actually says
46:36
in the bible if they could come back
46:37
it'd be for one thing
46:39
to be a part of what's going on now
46:42
that's how important these days are
46:45
and so i've been talking quite a bit
46:47
about the days of glory
46:49
it says that the knowledge of the glory
46:52
will cover the earth like the waters
46:54
cover the sea there's two things you
46:56
need to realize
46:57
there's two thirds of water on this
47:00
earth
47:01
that's significant when he says like the
47:03
waters cover the sea that's much more
47:05
water than land
47:06
and what he's trying to say is you go
47:08
many times over
47:10
you will carry that glory you won't go
47:13
somewhere and say glory come
47:15
it'll be in you and it's released
47:19
and it does huge things when you release
47:22
it
47:25
the knowledge isn't just oh it's the
47:28
glory
47:29
it's the understanding of what it is and
47:32
what it does the knowing the
47:33
understanding
47:35
and the experiencing of it so you will
47:37
do that
47:38
and the glory grows in you like a cloud
47:42
and at one point now this happened to me
47:45
because i've been talking about it at
47:46
this little place in missouri
47:48
and went back to the products table and
47:51
i started walking back and people
47:52
started just falling and i'm like
47:54
i could feel this power of god
47:57
his power the glorious power it comes
48:00
from him
48:01
it's what's around him on the throne on
48:03
the father
48:05
his son carried it on this earth and so
48:08
we
48:08
we each get a measure remember things
48:10
are given in measures but it can grow
48:13
so i've been talking my son-in-law was
48:15
with me handling the products table
48:16
who's like an irish
48:19
he's quite a character he's born again
48:21
he's he's uh
48:22
he is fearless and so he was a great
48:26
addition to our family
48:28
it took him to be able to marry my
48:30
daughter who's just like me
48:35
prayed prayed him in and prayed
48:37
everybody else away
48:38
i ran off every guy that was the wrong
48:40
guy it didn't take much
48:43
to make trips to heaven over time would
48:45
you like to go
48:48
one was a baptist boy bless his little
48:50
heart
48:53
my daughter is a seer she prophesies she
48:56
knows all about these things i know she
48:57
probably hadn't told you that
48:59
uh and and i go to heaven all the time
49:01
non-stop would you like to be able to do
49:02
that this whole time he's backing up
49:04
right
49:04
it's getting big i said the kids you
49:06
have will become prophets and seers
49:09
they'll travel to the spirit realm
49:11
they'll grab about one in heaven and
49:13
just
49:14
scare this little guy so much
49:17
no i'm going to marry her she's going to
49:19
have my 2.5 children i don't know what
49:21
that
49:23
and she will only do what i can tell i
49:25
tell her she can do
49:30
you have not known my daughter for very
49:33
long
49:37
that will never happen
49:39
[Laughter]
49:41
and i kept trying to show my daughter
49:42
this this is not love it was like it was
49:44
like
49:45
they liked they liked the idea of being
49:47
married don't get fooled okay
49:50
you don't have to ask somebody
49:53
if you are in love
49:56
to somebody you cannot live without
50:00
that's filled with god and you are so
50:03
overwhelmed that the blessing god has
50:04
given you if you have to come up and say
50:06
do you think i'm in love
50:07
[Laughter]
50:10
no and so i told they were planning
50:15
their wedding and everything and i want
50:16
you're not going to be happy
50:17
why don't you go visit his house and his
50:19
dad was a fully in charge
50:21
baptist he had to give permission to
50:24
everybody around the table to speak
50:28
oh yeah yeah her eyes start to get is
50:30
this okay to tell stories on myself
50:33
see i've experienced this self i know
50:36
you don't want to meet the wrong person
50:39
she comes back she goes i said how was
50:41
it
50:42
the food was good
50:45
but i already knew because i'm a seer i
50:47
can see where they are
50:49
i can see what's going on when they're
50:50
not with me how about that for a parent
50:56
i know where you are right now if you
50:59
don't get out of that movie i'll be
51:00
there in 15 minutes we'll have revival
51:02
in the theater
51:09
and by the way there will be a
51:11
repentance thing you can sign and take
51:13
communion before you come back in the
51:15
house
51:19
that was growing up with me
51:25
jen's raising her hand because jesus
51:28
lived with me and my mom
51:29
they loved me since 1999 so they know
51:31
all this stuff they saw all this stuff
51:33
happen
51:33
she knows
51:36
[Laughter]
51:44
see i'm telling the truth that's what
51:47
happens when
51:48
you're here but it's the relationship i
51:50
had
51:53
and so i kept telling my daughter you're
51:54
not in love you're not marrying that boy
51:57
i'll lay down in the aisle well i'm
51:58
telling i was telling all these things
52:00
you know
52:00
we'll have deliverance service serve all
52:02
the baptists
52:04
[Music]
52:06
and i have very good baptist friends
52:08
okay
52:11
there'd be a lot of people in hell right
52:13
now if i had meant for them
52:17
but there's no way that with that was
52:19
not a match made in heaven
52:21
they'd be doing like this because my
52:24
daughter is just like me
52:26
in every way and out of the three the
52:29
only one about heads with is guess who
52:35
but they're raising their kids in the
52:37
supernatural
52:38
yeah so finally it's
52:42
good so i told my daughter i'm going to
52:46
fast
52:47
dr pepper now that for me was like
52:50
i'm pouring my life out right the
52:52
biggest fast i could do
52:53
because i only eat once a day there's
52:55
not much to eat so i'm fasting dr pepper
52:56
for three weeks
52:58
at the end of that three weeks you will
52:59
come to me and say i don't want him
53:01
anymore
53:02
but i have met this person
53:07
at the end of three weeks guess what
53:08
happened
53:10
mom how do i break up with scott why did
53:13
i think it was anything
53:15
i have met ben
53:22
she never said scott like that
53:28
she never said scott ah scott's coming
53:31
over
53:32
[Laughter]
53:34
yes bless his little heart he found him
53:37
a nice little baptist girl and they're
53:38
very happy just so you know that okay he
53:40
didn't damage him
53:43
and there was batten and i
53:46
interrogated everybody who came up my
53:48
husband laid back
53:50
you know let's go fishing man
53:51
[Laughter]
53:54
it's the only break they'll ever get
53:59
so when i met ben
54:05
oh by the way in this whole process of
54:06
realizing scott wasn't the right person
54:08
she rebelled against him she got a
54:10
mohawk
54:10
[Laughter]
54:14
her hair was like down here she got
54:16
herself a mohawk and then the holy
54:18
spirit had told her to put lightning
54:19
bolts
54:20
tattoo them on her sides get ready for
54:24
kids for today y'all
54:27
and she has uh gifted and danced highly
54:31
i mean highly anointed and so when she
54:34
was like 14 the holy spirit came to
54:36
again and said
54:37
i want you to put brass knuckles on your
54:39
feet because they're weapons of god
54:41
and they're like this long no she don't
54:43
do anything little
54:45
so she came and showed them to us after
54:47
y'all and i went
54:48
if god and god told me i did tell her to
54:51
do that
54:53
she's a sign and a wonder and she got to
54:55
minister so many places and they
54:58
she had red and purple hair i mean just
54:59
just tell me she was so
55:01
far out there in the heaven culture it
55:02
was crazy she needed ben
55:06
and the holy spirit calls him the irish
55:07
boy with charmin blarney
55:12
who pulls down you know he displaces
55:16
principalities with the army of heaven
55:21
and i went you were made for her
55:23
[Laughter]
55:26
it's worth standing in the gap for your
55:29
children
55:30
that they have the one god needs them to
55:33
have
55:36
your life is a journey but you don't
55:39
ever ever have to be in a pit
55:43
never and even if your children end up
55:46
by running with the enemy
55:48
they're up and out of home running for
55:49
the enemy just let them know i love you
55:52
i'm running after jesus
55:54
but he will get you
55:57
and they see you not messed up or upset
56:01
or torn
56:02
apart because jesus the joy of the lord
56:05
is your
56:07
you can be strong all the time
56:11
you couldn't go after them anyway
56:15
that would be havoc then you would be
56:18
torn apart
56:19
and then they would isolate you okay
56:22
they got to live their life and make the
56:23
choices
56:23
you stand in that gap i believe and
56:25
declare my child will know jesus christ
56:28
become a witness for him and we'll be
56:30
together in eternity
56:32
and i'm running after jesus and
56:33
eventually one day they'll come to you
56:35
and say i need help
56:39
if they want to come back home you
56:40
better have a list of guidelines already
56:42
prepared
56:44
don't let hell in your home because
56:45
you're trying to help your kids
56:48
i'm serious that that would be the
56:50
enemy's plan
56:52
if you're willing to follow the
56:54
guidelines i don't care if they're 40
56:56
or 30. it is your realm
57:01
you create a habitation for heaven and
57:03
god will make sure you know they don't
57:05
die in the ditch somewhere
57:08
but they have to learn they can't use
57:10
you or take advantage of you because you
57:11
love them
57:14
this is truth i want you to have a
57:17
glorious
57:18
life and you have authority over all
57:22
that junk
57:24
but the glory of god is something he
57:28
does talk about
57:30
us having and we carry it and we release
57:33
it and everywhere we go
57:34
it will so impact it's like taking
57:36
bazookas
57:37
into an area where the enemy is trying
57:40
to control
57:41
and they just shoot it really shoots
57:43
into those demons
57:44
and it terrifies them it will begin to
57:48
cover people like a cloud whole area
57:50
sometimes whole cities
57:51
will be covered with the glory you carry
57:53
somewhere it's coming from you
57:57
so when i got back to the room the other
57:59
night i was still being consumed by
58:01
this power of god that was he was here
58:04
trust me he was here and he spoke last
58:06
night
58:08
and i was thanking him for letting me
58:09
experience all that
58:11
he says i need to let you know
58:15
that glory was coming from you that
58:16
wasn't mine
58:21
that was coming from you that's what you
58:23
already carry
58:25
then i got undone
58:30
we're entering into powerful days it's
58:32
not about your age or where you came
58:34
from
58:35
what profession you have it is
58:38
about your relationship with jesus
58:40
christ
58:42
and in heaven everyone in heaven is in
58:44
love with him
58:46
everybody they still love their family
58:49
here but he is they're number one
58:53
he is so it is is a profound thing
58:57
and a high honor to carry
59:00
parts of them the fire and the glory it
59:03
all comes from
59:04
them all of it say all
59:08
that can't come from your physical being
59:10
is something that has to do with your
59:11
spirit man inside of you
59:13
and that your soul has agreed to give
59:15
god permission to do whatever he wants
59:17
to with you
59:18
and then when he says something do it
59:21
right
59:23
the more you do it the more he gives you
59:26
that's like
59:26
a job if you work well well in the past
59:28
it used to mean that
59:29
if you got a job you worked hard work
59:31
well we're honest and hard
59:33
you got promoted above everybody else
59:36
some companies are still like that but
59:38
it's always that way with god
59:41
he doesn't love one person more than the
59:42
other but some he can use more than the
59:44
other
59:46
don't let jealousy consume you don't
59:48
covet somebody else's anointing you have
59:50
your own
59:52
remember first john 2 27
59:56
the more you release the anointing you
59:57
know what the anointing looks like it
59:59
looks like a blue fire
60:02
it looks like blue fire
60:05
we're going to stir up the anointing
60:06
today and i'm going to release the glory
60:08
on y'all
60:12
but america's greatest call it has
60:16
is to be a country known because it
60:19
belongs to god
60:21
and the glory of god will cover this
60:24
land
60:26
it will create regions of light those
60:28
who refuse it will have regions of
60:30
darkness
60:32
until jesus comes all the darkness isn't
60:34
going to just evaporate off the earth
60:36
but there'll be seasons where it's
60:37
pushed back and crushed back
60:39
until it will have to have a region of
60:41
darkness to operate in
60:43
these are powerful times people who live
60:46
in the regions of glory you'll get to
60:48
choose
60:48
there won't be an in between he's
60:51
erasing the great area that says there
60:53
is no god
60:55
even in what he's doing right now
60:58
to this whole election thing he's
61:00
exposing the souls of
61:02
men as a man think is in his
61:06
soul or his heart so is he
61:10
so why are these people hating wanting
61:13
to kill wanting to control
61:15
and you know they're doing that but i
61:16
think they're dictators over states or
61:18
cities
61:20
not even realizing in their own head i
61:23
have no way to be reelected
61:24
that's right if i'm crushing the life
61:26
out of the people i'm supposed to be
61:28
leading and watching over
61:30
why would they want that again they're
61:33
moving to states where they don't have
61:34
control
61:36
because they're tired of it these aren't
61:38
even people who are christians they're
61:39
just
61:39
good moral people i call them the moral
61:42
majority
61:43
who want life who actually do care about
61:45
the life of the unborn
61:47
they may not know jesus but they have a
61:49
life they have a family they want a
61:50
future that's the majority along with
61:53
the believers who will vote trump in
61:56
because they've already they've seen
62:00
his witness and testimony is he's
62:02
already been doing that
62:04
and so the enemy satan is so terrified
62:08
because he's planning to take over our
62:10
country
62:11
and make it his own and that's not going
62:14
to happen
62:17
it isn't i don't care what the news says
62:22
they don't know how to do anything but
62:23
lie even the polls i give are like
62:26
almost
62:27
insane
62:30
the polls biden's uh 80 ahead and i went
62:32
where are the people voting for
62:35
and who would that be the ones he bought
62:38
or the ballots they stole
62:42
no even god says they're stealing even
62:44
he tells me
62:45
they're stealing ballots and then
62:47
they're going to harvest them and thumb
62:48
and dump
62:49
dumpsters and i'm going to expose it i
62:51
mean
62:52
the enemy is doing whatever he pays off
62:54
people to vote more than once and states
62:56
that you could do that
62:57
i mean they're they're really doing that
62:59
they are corrupt
63:02
and they may have been nice loving
63:04
people one point but when you give
63:05
yourself to the darkness
63:06
it will consume you to a point where
63:09
you're blinded
63:12
and you don't even know that you just
63:14
know that you really they really
63:16
really believe they're going to win
63:19
because of the
63:20
news the fake news lying
63:24
they watch it they believe the lie this
63:26
is true
63:28
hillary fainted when she found out she
63:30
didn't win she knew even though she had
63:31
no people
63:33
it's the truth she wouldn't even appear
63:36
she fainted people had to get
63:37
psychiatric help
63:40
because they were convinced in their
63:42
soul by the
63:44
lies they believed a lie so when they
63:47
didn't win they fell apart
63:50
they sincerely needed psychiatric help
63:53
and all these years have gone by they're
63:56
still getting fed with the same
63:58
lies or more lies they're so so
64:00
corrupted
64:02
they even treat their families different
64:05
some families have been separated
64:07
business partners
64:08
businesses have churches have separated
64:12
my head can't wrap around how can a
64:13
pastor say to vote for the other side
64:15
when they want to kill babies
64:19
oh it is i'm going to always give you
64:21
the truth this
64:22
is the truth you cannot side with the
64:27
darkness
64:29
and i personally know people sweetest
64:31
people you ever knew are so filled with
64:33
hate they hate hate hate trump
64:37
i can't say his name i can't bring one
64:39
thing about him and i'm like
64:42
what happened to you
64:45
they watch the fake news and
64:48
and this is the thing they're not just
64:49
watching it they're believing it
64:52
the more you believe it is real even on
64:55
the wrong side the more real it becomes
64:57
and that's what's wrong with those
64:58
people believers
65:02
you cannot choose death
65:07
you're surrendering authority over the
65:10
enemy
65:12
you do when you choose what the enemy
65:13
wants you watering down your authority
65:17
you can't you can't choose it's okay to
65:20
kill
65:22
you have given authority by christ but
65:24
you walk in the light remember that
65:27
walk in the spirit walk in the light
65:28
follow after him
65:30
we know what he thinks about it we know
65:33
what the father thinks about it
65:36
he's sending these little babies and
65:39
then the point of time he
65:41
needs them on the earth
65:45
satan has a plan this is his plan if i
65:48
can kill them remember when he killed
65:49
him first time in egypt remember that
65:51
he didn't want moses to deliver a person
65:54
to be mourned so what did he do he
65:55
killed babies right
65:57
then the whole abortion thing started
65:59
because he doesn't want somebody
66:02
to be born who will have a voice
66:05
that will speak the truth and the life
66:07
and the power of god to people
66:08
so he'll just wipe out as many as he can
66:10
so that's why that's the
66:12
truth about why abortion started that
66:14
was satan's plan
66:16
just don't let him live don't let him
66:19
laugh
66:20
his new thing he's using is
66:22
homosexuality
66:24
do you know why that all came up not
66:26
just to steal people's destinies
66:28
no babies born
66:32
this is absolute truth from god
66:36
he wants to stop god's plans
66:41
for the people he made
66:44
so whatever he can bring a lie if you
66:47
can get people to believe a lie this is
66:49
really who you are you're not this
66:50
person
66:51
you know this your other person well
66:53
guess what two guys can't have a baby
66:54
and do women get a baby
66:57
so the bottom line is he doesn't want
66:59
him born
67:01
that's why it's going to be great when
67:03
abortion is outlawed
67:15
i've seen the place in heaven where all
67:17
these little babies are kept and loved
67:18
and
67:19
nurtured and if they have family members
67:21
there they will eventually get these
67:23
little babies and they get to raise them
67:25
if their parents make it if their
67:27
parents were involved in that repent
67:29
and get born again they get that little
67:31
baby back
67:33
that's how good god is
67:37
that's how good god is so when you see
67:40
the big
67:41
or you're getting a big picture how
67:44
important
67:44
it is for us
67:47
to live our life for him
67:51
not just once a week
67:54
you go to sleep living for him you wake
67:58
up
67:58
living for him running your race
68:01
powerfully taken power and authority
68:05
over the enemy
68:07
wherever there is destruction wherever
68:09
there is evil
68:10
you can send the army to pull down
68:13
strongholds shred
68:14
platforms because all of the evil on the
68:17
earth
68:18
is still is still controlled by satan
68:21
he finds people who are willing to do it
68:23
people who don't even know there is a
68:24
god
68:25
you know and some other countries is far
68:27
worse than is here
68:28
far worse you know evil is
68:33
or the power of evil unless you go to
68:36
some of those third world countries
68:38
america is one of the greatest countries
68:40
in the world
68:41
because we're founded by christian
68:44
principles
68:45
god is on our papers that's what he says
68:47
to me all the time
68:49
one nation under god
68:53
is one of the lines satan hates the most
68:56
he don't want him he doesn't want him
68:59
involved anywhere in our lives or in
69:00
this country
69:01
but he isn't going to stop it so we will
69:04
be a living example
69:06
here the body of christ in this country
69:08
of who god is
69:11
and that he is he does live
69:14
that christ lives that we have authority
69:16
over things they're going to see things
69:17
people will begin to run after
69:19
christians
69:20
to be their friend in the in the months
69:21
and years ahead because they see things
69:23
happening to them but they realize
69:25
they're prospering
69:26
these years of prosperity and in
69:29
increase
69:30
of in every way of revelation with the
69:33
ideas and inventions god's going to give
69:35
a lot of that to believers so people
69:36
will have to get
69:37
get stuff from them
69:40
so we can't hide we can't run to the
69:43
hills and hide
69:44
take vacation but you can't preach this
69:47
gospel to the bears
69:53
and raise your children to do the same
69:56
god is a generational god and children
69:59
will be powerful in the earth
70:02
and and there will be a point in this
70:04
country at least nobody can
70:06
have abortions it will become
70:10
[Applause]
70:14
illegal
70:16
so god has his timeline and he knows
70:19
who inside him
70:22
he's already picked up generations and
70:25
said you be this
70:26
you'll be the aunt you'll be the uncle
70:28
and you'll be in this generation
70:30
20 years later this one will be born and
70:32
will carry this on and carry on
70:34
generational lines or call on
70:35
generations
70:37
and so this is why it's important when
70:38
he sends them they get to stay
70:42
amen there is something that happens
70:46
every now and then
70:47
because he's god if he sends one
70:50
and his life gets ended quickly he will
70:52
take the whole spirit back
70:55
and rescind it
70:58
that's probably the first time you've
70:59
heard that
71:02
because he has to have that
71:06
person on the earth
71:10
he has to have it he even had me share
71:12
somebody with that that they had
71:14
a baby uh it was a little a little well
71:17
i think they they thought it was why
71:18
they weren't sure
71:19
and god told me his name and called them
71:22
and said
71:22
uh he said he was struggling so he took
71:25
him but he's going to send him back
71:29
say he's god they came from him
71:35
and he does what he needs to
71:55
whether you miscarried or a baby was
71:57
aborted
71:59
um way back in the day when all that
72:01
stuff kind of started
72:03
most of the time the young people
72:04
weren't involved in that
72:06
it was pressure from the parents that
72:09
you can't live your life with a baby
72:10
hanging on whatever
72:12
the babies the second i will tell you
72:14
what their their guardian angel
72:17
which is sent at conception will take
72:19
them home to heaven and the second
72:22
of course the little baby spirit leaves
72:24
the baby body they're not experiencing
72:26
pain or suffering or anything
72:28
and they meet personally with jesus when
72:31
they're taken up to heaven he's got a
72:33
special place he meets
72:34
all of these little babies and they
72:36
actually receive him
72:38
as their savior
72:41
even in heaven they don't need to to
72:44
stay there but
72:44
they want to they want to
72:48
and so their love from the moment
72:50
they're there he has special places for
72:52
them to play
72:53
made just even for little babies this
72:55
big i've seen
72:56
an angel in the nursery holding five
72:58
little babies it's going to be in my
73:00
book three
73:02
and then from different different ethnic
73:03
groups and they were just playing in
73:05
this angel's hand it was precious
73:09
and he's made this play pond they ride
73:11
on turtles they can swim under water
73:13
breathe water
73:14
they have picnics with jesus they get
73:18
put in the pockets of the kangaroos and
73:19
they hop them around take them for rides
73:24
the nurseries are not don't look like a
73:26
clinic
73:28
they're huge nurseries it looks like
73:30
beehives
73:32
and the angels fly in and out they have
73:34
flowers growing all around these
73:35
beautiful little
73:36
gorgeous like mother-of-pearl seashells
73:39
with beautiful blankets in it and the
73:40
baby's name is over it
73:43
and the angels who work in these
73:45
nurseries will hold these babies
73:47
they sing the breath of god on them
73:50
nourishes their little baby spirit
73:52
and then they huh please
73:55
name your baby that's most important
73:59
because the angels give them a nickname
74:00
when they arrive
74:02
and that nickname is over have been to
74:03
the nursery several times
74:05
and uh when the parent decides to name
74:08
the baby
74:09
even if somebody wasn't married if the
74:12
mother can pick
74:12
a name for that baby pick one that could
74:15
be
74:16
either or you know like sydney could be
74:19
a
74:19
boy or a girl something like that pick a
74:22
name because this is what happens the
74:24
father sends for the baby i get i get
74:26
over
74:26
my own he'll send that little baby
74:30
and he'll say i have a gift
74:33
your parent just named you so no longer
74:36
are you going to be called by your
74:37
nickname
74:38
this is your name and they have a big
74:42
party in heaven for this little baby
74:45
they actually have a cake for it and
74:46
everything
74:47
and they celebrate because their parents
74:49
recognize they were there
74:52
and that they would be given back people
74:54
bring little gifts to that baby
74:57
and and they change the name over the
74:59
little thing
75:01
when a grandparent a great grandparent
75:03
gets home
75:04
they get that baby they go get the baby
75:08
they help to play with the baby raise
75:10
the baby
75:11
it grows so slowly it could be 50 years
75:14
later and your baby would still be a
75:15
baby
75:19
god is beautiful and
75:22
he loves his babies that's why he said
75:25
it would be worse than having a
75:27
millstone
75:28
i wouldn't want to be any of the
75:29
democrats right now
75:32
it'd be better for a millstone you know
75:34
how big they are about the size of that
75:35
world maybe bigger
75:36
that map a millstone that they would
75:39
grind things with
75:40
and it'd be better for you to have one
75:42
tied around your neck and thrown into
75:44
the sea
75:44
than the punishment you will get for
75:46
doing that
75:48
i think he doesn't like it
75:52
and i tell people but because god has a
75:54
heart of love if you repent
75:56
for that if you repent for doing that
76:00
and give yourself to jesus
76:02
from that moment your baby will be
76:04
excited
76:05
they know you got born again they know
76:08
you're coming to heaven that's all they
76:09
can talk about as they will be with
76:11
their
76:11
family again so yay jesus
76:19
so i have to say like god would say
76:23
every life matters
76:28
no matter what the color of your skin is
76:31
we came from the same god
76:34
and he loves all of us and he has plans
76:38
for
76:38
all of us in heaven we're a family
76:43
there's no baptist street you know
76:45
people always want to put religion on
76:47
something there's no
76:48
pentecostal street there's no you know i
76:51
can't think of the denominations
76:52
there's no baptist assembly of god
76:54
there's there's not
76:57
your mansion is made for you by the way
76:58
when you come home you come home as a
77:00
son or daughter
77:01
you're not coming home as i was their
77:05
wife
77:06
you know each other like best friends
77:08
but you come home
77:09
as the father's son or daughter
77:15
so don't worry if you're married three
77:16
times we're all in heaven you'll have
77:17
three friends
77:22
nobody owns anybody and the father did
77:25
explain this to me i love him because he
77:28
just
77:28
opens up revelation to me to share with
77:30
people there's a reason why you can't be
77:32
still married when you go to heaven
77:34
till death do you part
77:38
because from that moment you're just his
77:40
son or daughter
77:42
you don't stop loving the people on the
77:44
earth but jesus is our number one
77:47
there's only one bridegroom in heaven
77:51
and the father said this is why i had to
77:54
say
77:54
once you die you come home to heaven not
77:56
married
77:57
in heaven you are not married like on
77:59
the earth on the earth
78:01
the angels are not married either
78:03
they're not that's probably a plus for
78:04
them
78:11
they're most of them now i know some of
78:13
them actually wanted to have all spring
78:15
that way that was a wildest thing to me
78:17
why would they want to
78:19
but in heaven the angels are pretty glad
78:21
they don't have to get married
78:24
because they watch us
78:27
but god sends them on assignments i i
78:29
need a tissue
78:30
um he sends them on assignments with
78:33
somebody who's the opposite personality
78:36
if you've ever been around a comedian
78:37
you are a very focused
78:39
thank you once good enough
78:46
if you're a focused serious person the
78:48
last thing you want to be with is a
78:50
comedian
78:52
you're being sent on assignment right
78:54
you're here to rescue this person from
78:56
whatever whatever whatever
78:57
stop the enemy's attacks on them and
78:59
this the one angel i just want to wipe
79:01
them all out let's just wipe them out
79:02
get rid of them
79:03
they're done they don't deserve anything
79:06
and here's the comedian
79:07
but won't it be fun uh maybe we'll make
79:10
some new connections while we're down
79:12
there
79:13
maybe some make some new friends maybe
79:15
go have some angel food together
79:16
somewhere
79:19
and this other one is tipped off now
79:21
they don't sin
79:22
but i mean he is annoyed because this
79:25
one is rubbing him the wrong way
79:28
which is the way he doesn't want to go
79:30
like we do his husband and wife
79:33
and this could be a long assignment
79:37
and god's out there saying you just
79:39
better get along
79:42
and every now and then they'll send a
79:43
courier down there you're being watched
79:45
and notes are being made and you have to
79:50
realize too these are real beings
79:52
they have personalities they have
79:54
assignments they like certain things
79:57
they have comedians
79:59
the two that help me write books one is
80:01
that holy fierce one the other one's a
80:03
comedian
80:04
and they do steal rubbish all the fun
80:08
silly things in the book where stuff the
80:10
information was given to me by the fun
80:12
angel
80:12
the one about hellfire and all the other
80:15
stuff
80:16
was given god sent me two scribe angels
80:21
they came from gabriel and i have my own
80:24
angel he's 40 foot tall
80:26
he's behind me last night make sure i
80:28
don't fall over
80:32
when you have the life of a seer it's
80:33
different
80:36
you see operations on both sides and you
80:39
can share with people truth that can
80:41
help them
80:41
be free but if you're in the flesh you
80:44
know what happens right
80:46
to be spiritually minded is life
80:49
to be fleshy minded is death
80:52
that doesn't mean god doesn't love you
80:54
it just means he can't use you a lot if
80:56
you're always getting in the flesh
80:58
which growing up all the body knew was
81:01
to be in the flesh
81:03
unless you had a move of god that he
81:04
changed while the move was there
81:08
moves of god in this time will actually
81:11
begin to create a habitation
81:15
that's god inhabiting your whole life
81:20
so these are profound days serious days
81:23
but exciting days for us
81:26
he has really got your life in his hand
81:29
if you belong to him
81:31
but don't leave him out of everything
81:35
make room for a christ in your life
81:37
every day
81:39
and i have conversations with him all
81:41
the time
81:43
the holy spirit is my teacher who tweaks
81:46
me a lot
81:48
and the father just loves me and gives
81:50
me revelation
81:53
i wish everybody could experience that
81:56
it's like life in heaven it's like life
82:00
in heaven it is it's just like that
82:04
if you want to be with the father he'll
82:06
make himself available in heaven to be
82:07
with you
82:10
he has this beautiful place he took me
82:13
two one time i'm like
82:14
eight years old and he'll say where
82:17
would you like to go
82:19
i can take you to the past i can take
82:21
you to the future
82:23
and i said i just want to be with you
82:25
this was my answer from my own soul
82:28
and he said well you know i can show you
82:29
powerful things that happen
82:31
the great days of the great revivals and
82:34
you want to go see the welsh you want to
82:35
go visit the welsh revival
82:37
you want you want to go see this was
82:38
created on the earth you want to go
82:40
see time when it was made and i just
82:43
want to be with you
82:45
and the third time he said are you sure
82:48
you don't want to go back and see when
82:50
you were a little tiny thing in me
82:53
you don't want to see when i cast
82:55
lucifer out of heaven because he knows
82:56
i'm fierce against the enemy
82:58
i am right where i want to be and that's
83:00
what he wanted to hear
83:03
he said well that is what i wanted to
83:05
hear you say
83:07
and so then he put his arms around me he
83:09
can be as big as he wants big enough
83:11
that the world is a speck of dust in his
83:13
hand
83:14
or small enough to step inside himself
83:16
and play with all the little spirits
83:20
that's who he is so
83:23
i've gotten to a place in my life
83:25
whatever he wants
83:26
or needs i'm doing it
83:29
because nothing is worth missing
83:32
blessing him i've learned the joy of
83:34
obedience
83:36
obedience isn't like a heart thing
83:38
anymore it's
83:39
a joy to obey because it blesses him
83:43
when i love people when i share truth
83:45
when i share revelation
83:47
i didn't even really like the pink hair
83:49
but i let them do it
83:53
so i couldn't hide and these days a lot
83:55
of people won't be able to hide anymore
83:58
it'll be too apparent with the glory
84:00
coming out of you or the fire
84:02
on your head the fire on your homes
84:06
people falling out when they pass in
84:07
front of your house because of the life
84:09
of god you have there
84:11
it's because of him
84:16
you're going to be different
84:19
not normal
84:22
not normal and america was designed by
84:25
god to be a light in this world for his
84:27
son
84:28
to come and send two-thirds of the
84:30
gospel around the world
84:33
more people give to the gospel from this
84:35
country than any other nation in the
84:37
world
84:38
more people are sent from here to any
84:40
other nation to the world
84:42
because of god that's his plan he calls
84:44
america his gift
84:46
his son is the greatest gift but he
84:47
still says america is my gift to the
84:49
world
84:50
i'm not giving it to anyone else
84:53
[Applause]
84:56
so no matter what this is the thing you
84:58
need to understand no matter what they
84:59
say on election day
85:03
if it's not what you expected just
85:06
wait and see what happens
85:11
i never go by what man says i go what
85:15
god's plans are
85:17
and he is taking america back
85:24
amen he's taking it back
85:28
and from america this world will begin
85:30
to be changed
85:32
and show other countries leaders this is
85:35
the way you
85:35
run your country justice
85:39
liberty freedom and righteousness
85:43
and he will have open doors to some of
85:45
these leaders that didn't know they
85:46
could do anything but war
85:49
and the darkness would be being to be
85:51
stripped away because of our authority
85:53
we can't kill satan we can't kill demons
85:55
but by our living our life and releasing
85:58
the glory
85:59
carrying it sharing the truth about the
86:02
gospel of the kingdom
86:03
and running after what god wants in our
86:06
lives
86:07
there's no way they can escape not
86:08
knowing something's going on here
86:11
and then we'll come to america to find
86:13
jesus christ
86:15
amen so we all have a commission
86:18
and even those who don't want him he's
86:21
gonna
86:22
get some really stuff hot stuff going
86:24
right there will be great harvest in
86:26
this country
86:27
and great harvest around the world but
86:30
until he's ready it will not be the end
86:33
okay so we focus on what we're doing
86:36
right now what he wants
86:37
right now and needs right now pray for
86:40
all those people who've been feeding
86:42
themselves with lies
86:44
when trump wins it won't be good for
86:46
them
86:47
we'll rejoice and have a party but many
86:48
people will think their life has ended
86:51
because of the lies that were told to
86:52
them
86:53
and so we're going to break all that
86:55
garbage let's just stand up and declare
86:56
together something
86:59
we'll pray for him right now
87:04
i do know that eventually i'm not sure
87:06
when but some of the networks will be
87:07
taken from them
87:11
they'll just be taken from them and
87:13
given to those who will share the truth
87:14
or who will be at least
87:16
unbiased i mean the news is always i
87:18
remember the day when you actually
87:19
watched the news and it was real news
87:22
and it's consumed on with hate because
87:25
the enemy is running it right
87:28
so he's going to get unseated so right
87:30
now we all want to declare and
87:32
pray on election day especially
87:36
well we're going to thank god for
87:38
everyone
87:39
voting because you have to vote
87:42
don't forget to vote right encourage
87:44
people to vote uh but we're going to
87:46
pray for all those on the luck today who
87:48
have been filling themselves with lies
87:50
that the enemy would not talk them into
87:52
taking their life because
87:53
god did tell me some people would take
87:55
their life
87:57
because they're so their layers are so
87:59
consumed with all of that
88:00
this is the only life we can have we
88:02
will not have a life
88:04
and they'll believe it so we're all
88:06
going to take authority i'll just lead
88:08
you into something to declare
88:10
and then i'm going to release the glory
88:12
into y'all
88:14
are you ready for that
88:22
jesus christ our lord and savior
88:28
our beloved who saved our soul
88:34
we honor your holy name
88:37
we recognize your life
88:41
that you gave for us we look forward
88:44
this day
88:47
and the future to ruin
88:50
reign with you that is your desire
88:56
so right now we corporately
89:00
stand in the gap for those who've
89:04
believed a lie
89:07
and who hate without without measure
89:12
we pray for their souls
89:15
they will not be consumed with grief
89:20
when trump wins on november the third
89:24
we pray god the holy spirit
89:29
will go to those voting booths
89:32
and into the homes later
89:36
to speak to the soul of those people
89:39
to not take their life that there's
89:43
still
89:43
hope for them and we take
89:46
power over all the power of the enemy
89:51
has been controlling these lies and
89:54
these people
89:56
to bring deception we
89:59
command the army of heaven
90:02
to go right now and on
90:05
election day do you make sweeps around
90:09
this country
90:11
depart on every stronghold of satan
90:15
that is controlling them to shred
90:19
every platform of high-level spheres of
90:23
wickedness
90:25
that would like to take their lives
90:29
we say in the name of the lord
90:33
we will not tolerate those actions
90:37
we will not tolerate the enemy
90:40
ruining people's destinies
90:44
we say no more will you control
90:48
this country or run this country
90:53
or steal people's destinies
90:56
this is a time of celebration and
91:00
greatness
91:02
and we declare those people who believe
91:06
the lie
91:08
will not miss their destiny
91:11
they will become believers in jesus
91:13
christ
91:14
and great witnesses to his salvation
91:20
so be it in jesus name
91:24
[Applause]
91:27
[Music]
91:28
amen
91:32
[Applause]
91:39
oh sit down for just a minute
91:44
[Music]
91:46
there's many ways we can do do this
91:49
importations
91:51
and there's one of the ways i do it
91:53
quite often when we have
91:54
a quite a bit of people i have everybody
91:56
hold hands
91:57
it's going to be okay you won't get sick
92:00
we evict any of that we won't tolerate
92:03
any sickness in this
92:04
no we don't tolerate the virus anymore
92:07
either right
92:08
we kick it out and evict it from this
92:10
place
92:13
only each row not all the way across
92:15
okay only like this row hold hands
92:17
just this row i'm gonna come by
92:21
i'm gonna come by and i'm gonna grab the
92:23
hand of the person and literally
92:26
it will flow through every person
92:29
[Music]
92:31
i want you to picture i want you to
92:35
picture this
92:35
really happens i've done a congregation
92:38
with 3 000 people
92:40
like this and you're already sitting
92:43
so if you have to fall at least it's
92:45
backwards
92:49
the glory is the power and presence of
92:51
the living god
92:55
it comes in a form of a cloud like light
92:58
the glory is always talked about as the
93:00
light or a cloud
93:02
remember the cloud by day the fire by
93:03
night they both belong to him they do
93:06
different things inside of us baptism
93:08
and fire will burn the whole world off
93:10
the walls of your soul
93:13
like it was never there things you
93:15
things you saw
93:16
things that bothered you that's what the
93:18
fire does i've had a measure
93:20
it came in and hit me so hard when the
93:22
pastor ladies and i was thrown back into
93:24
the congregation
93:26
with a usher a seven foot usher
93:29
thrown and my body laid on the floor and
93:32
it
93:32
shook that's fire okay
93:36
and and the first time ever angels came
93:38
and took me back in time
93:41
my body was there they locked me in with
93:43
a security guard
93:44
stuck a note in my sleeve when she wakes
93:46
up my dad will come and get her
93:48
call this number i was taken back to the
93:51
tomb of christ
93:53
right after the stone had been rolled
93:55
away i was
93:56
there at that time
93:59
if he takes you the time you're there
94:02
it's not a vision it's not a dream
94:05
and i have a lot of revelation about his
94:08
resurrection
94:09
what that looked like what went on it
94:11
was really powerful and then he brought
94:13
me back and all i could do was speak in
94:14
tongues for two weeks
94:16
and i had open visions of the fire
94:19
hitting
94:20
cities whole cities and congregations
94:24
is something you don't have to ask
94:26
people
94:27
did you get baptism and fire
94:30
the glory is something that builds in
94:33
you
94:35
the more you know him spend time with
94:37
him
94:38
obey him this glory he let you
94:41
carry it for him and let me tell you
94:45
people will be seeking that out
94:47
it can sometimes be visibly seen on
94:50
moses the glory was seen on his face
94:53
remember that
94:54
because he was what with god
94:58
when you spend time with him that glory
95:01
begins to build in you
95:02
and it even says at one point the night
95:06
will be light around us in other words
95:07
it won't come upon you if you go outside
95:09
you are the light walking around like
95:12
people can't escape that
95:14
what is that light on you what is that
95:18
you get to share all about jesus and the
95:21
glory
95:22
right and then when you get into loose
95:25
and waves
95:26
it begins to it will totally wipe out
95:28
anything of the darkness around people
95:30
in buildings and that that glory cloud
95:33
it's a cloud i saw a sole cloud last
95:35
night just ruling around me the whole
95:37
time
95:38
and uh and sometimes you can hear it
95:41
it's like a shock wave
95:44
you can hear it
95:50
and i'm like the first time it happened
95:51
i'm like wow that person is really
95:53
anointed i was walking past
95:56
at the product's table and the holy
95:57
spirit was just laughing he said go just
95:59
start walking along the line
96:00
and where they went they went
96:04
and i said well this were those people
96:07
anointed he goes that was coming from
96:09
you
96:11
will let you experience releasing the
96:13
glory
96:16
and when you take it around the world
96:17
that's what happens to cities
96:21
this is for the body of christ
96:25
so you're going to get a measure of that
96:27
glory
96:28
we do it by laying on our hands if i
96:30
feel like it's not enough i'm just going
96:31
to mind touch it i might run over top of
96:33
the rose i don't know what i'll do
96:35
a greater work is walking on air
96:40
i've done that you feel nothing
96:43
but you're walking on it christ walked
96:46
on water he felt the water
96:48
walking on years of greater work
96:51
that awesome this is for us this is who
96:54
we are
96:56
it's because of who we belong to who we
96:59
give ourselves to
97:01
we have not just promises but we have
97:04
rights as believers to walk in all of
97:06
that
97:07
so i'm just going to start somewhere
97:09
over here and i will just grab the hand
97:12
and i'll feel it leaving me i'll feel
97:14
that leaving me
97:15
and it just goes down the row i'll go to
97:17

97:19

church
110:04
for a whole year now
110:07
faithfully and i can't wait for sunday
110:10
to come
110:12
i just didn't know you were on more than
110:14
sunday or i've been watching them
110:17
but i've seen so many of you on the
110:19
camera
110:20
and i thought these people are my family
110:27
and so
110:30
but but i want to speak now too just for
110:32
just a few minutes i'll try to make it
110:34
quick
110:37
because i'm not i'm really not you're
110:40
doing good so far
110:41
i'm not get up here but
110:45
from the time i was a little girl all i
110:48
ever wanted to be
110:48
was a wife little mother and i didn't
110:52
know the lord in my heart but i talked
110:54
to him
110:56
and i told him all i want to be is a
110:57
mother and a wife
111:00
and that's all i ever wanted to be
111:03
so when i got married
111:07
well i went to church with my
111:08
grandmother i was raised catholic but i
111:10
went to church from my grandmother to
111:11
her
111:12
old-time methodist church and
111:15
i got to hear hymns in english
111:18
so the one that stuck with me was in the
111:22
garden and i don't know whether any of
111:23
you even know that old
111:26
but i i was little and i sat there and i
111:29
heard them sing
111:31
he walks with me and he talks with me
111:35
and i never said anything to my grandma
111:37
but i
111:38
thought can you really do that
111:43
and amazingly even though i went to a
111:45
catholic school
111:47
and always went to church in the
111:49
confession
111:50
none of it stuck with me not one bit of
111:53
it
111:54
it just didn't stick so when i met my
111:58
husband
112:00
who was a spirit-filled
112:03
pentecostal
112:05
[Music]
112:07
and i just saw something in him
112:11
that i knew i had never felt before
112:16
and an assembly god pastor married us
112:18
and i wasn't saved
112:22
but i did he talked with me and i told
112:24
him my children will be raised in church
112:27
my husband's church
112:29
and i will go with him so he went ahead
112:32
and married us
112:34
but as i in the first year
112:38
i had my first baby she was two months
112:40
early
112:42
she only weighed four pounds a little
112:43
bitty thing
112:45
and i started praying over my babies i
112:48
prayed over them while i carried them
112:52
and i talked to the lord and i said all
112:55
i ever want
112:56
lord for my children is that they serve
112:59
you with their whole hearts
113:03
and i don't care where you call them to
113:04
go out back the
113:07
prayer and as they
113:10
little older when they grow up i gave
113:13
them back to the lord i said
113:15
their daddy and i have raised them to
113:17
know you
113:19
now they're your your job where you want
113:21
to send them
113:23
and i've never held back on one of them
113:26
and where they want to go
113:29
so don't ever ever give up on their
113:31
children
113:32
if you haven't had children yet
113:35
start praying for them before you even
113:37
get them
113:39
and don't ever back down because i've
113:40
gone through things with some of my kids
113:44
and i just always said lord they're
113:46
yours they're yours they're yours
113:48
they're yours
113:49
sometimes you have to give tough love
113:53
don't back down from that either it may
113:56
hurt
113:57
but in the long run you those that you
114:00
love you chastise
114:02
that's right it's good so i want to know
114:05
you to know how much i love all of you
114:09
and your your praise and everything else
114:13
you just bless me thank you lord hey
114:15

114:18
if you have uh and even if you're at
114:20

114:25
i want you to stand up
114:26

114:48
in the wilderness and you said
114:52

and when the time is ripe i'm just going
114:57
to close that hand and he'll be back
114:59

115:04
hinder your prayers

by Sermon For You Apr 18, 2021

or https://youtu.be/Mc1HfMmD3Sg

00:00
how important it is for us to be here
00:02
right now
00:03
and to have revelation to live by
00:07
i know we live in this world but we are
00:09
not of this world
00:12
we are hovanians first
00:17
how many people believe life in heaven
00:19
is better than anywhere else
00:21
[Music]
00:22
and everyone who lives there thinks so
00:27
and i know people picture you know a
00:28
handful in heaven and a multitude in
00:30
hell
00:31
but you're wrong there's millions
00:35
and millions and millions and millions
00:38
and millions of people who live in
00:39
heaven
00:41
that really got jesus some of it was on
00:44
their deathbed but they got him
00:47
some of them you'd be surprised who made
00:49
it when you get there
00:53
sometimes i was surprised
00:54
[Laughter]
00:57
but i'm here to uh god calls me a
01:00
revelator if you wonder where that
01:01
started it wasn't from me
01:03
most of the things i share are not from
01:05
me
01:06
i have to say them because he asked me
01:09
to say them
01:11
but i'm a revelator i reveal things and
01:13
john
01:14
in the book of john in revelation he
01:17
also was a revelator
01:19
and i've had people say the craziest
01:21
things to me well why do you say that
01:23
that's not anywhere in the bible there's
01:24
nothing about revelation in the bible
01:28
apparently you have not read the last
01:31
chapter
01:34
that's not a title or something that's
01:36
actually something that happened
01:38
it is a thing it's revelation from the
01:41
father
01:41
not from man and if it was important
01:44
enough to put
01:45
in the word of god then it's important
01:48
enough to still share it today
01:51
and i know i get a lot of revelation i
01:53
got new stuff today i got brand new
01:55
stuff today just sitting in the hotel
01:57
room
01:59
and jen said one thing to me and a
02:01
portal open and revelation on what she
02:04
asked me pour down from heaven
02:08
um that's not the first time it happened
02:10
but not not as much as i got
02:12
it didn't stop it was still going and i
02:15
finally had to uh
02:17
stop and go out the hallway of where we
02:19
were eating in the hotel and
02:21
just record what he had told me so fonda
02:23
was so much
02:25
and one of the things he did talk to me
02:27
about today
02:28
was kavanaugh yeah
02:33
he talked to me about kavanaugh and the
02:35
supreme court
02:37
and justice for america and so i will be
02:40
talking about this wearing my
02:42
my red word white and blue here and even
02:44
my boots see
02:45
they're red white and blue you have me
02:48
get those
02:53
i i got these from jones boot company
02:57
in missouri yes i think they're the
03:00
second or third largest in america
03:02
and i know by mentioning their name to
03:04
give a lot of money to the gospel
03:08
and i think it's third generation now a
03:10
very good friend of ours um
03:12
and a friend of mine daughter and her
03:14
husband my son-in-law
03:16
they're very close friends and he
03:18
recently took over
03:19
he's young he really recently took over
03:22
the hogue company
03:24
they started as a yarn distributor not
03:26
yarn but twine
03:28
uh and the holes were said no they
03:29
didn't sell yarn to bail the hay with
03:33
i don't know a lot about bailing hay but
03:35
i know you need more than yarn to tie it
03:37
all together
03:39
and they started you know doing that and
03:41
they're known all over the world
03:43
really they sell that but then they went
03:45
into the boot industry and
03:46
when i do go they sell to me like
03:48
one-third the price so i have a lot of
03:50
boots
03:51
and every time i go there to minister
03:53
they get me more boots but i wasn't
03:54
there this last time
03:56
uh god said why don't you get those with
03:57
the red white and blue on we like those
04:01
and i've worn them a lot especially if
04:03
we're going to talk about america
04:04
uh heaven wants me to wear red white and
04:06
blue
04:08
and i think today they're all wearing
04:10
red white and blue in heaven
04:13
if you if you think they're disconnected
04:15
from the things going on this earth
04:16
you don't know them they're very much
04:20
involved in what we are doing
04:22
because they're all declaring over the
04:24
destinies of all of us who are here
04:25
right now
04:27
those who finished the race and they
04:29
moved to heaven by the way they didn't
04:31
get lost
04:32
you don't need to tell people i lost my
04:34
father i lost them no they moved
04:36
that's right you know my father moved to
04:39
heaven
04:40
that's the greatest place you couldn't
04:42
even find it on this earth
04:44
having more fun than they ever had in
04:45
their life
04:47
they're existing to live yeah
04:51
you know down here a lot of times we
04:52
feel like we live just to exist
04:59
okay people some don't understand that i
05:02
do not believe that you
05:03
your whole body sleeps when it dies your
05:06
soul
05:06
never sleeps not now and your spirit man
05:09
never sleeps either
05:10
there's both spiritual things they're
05:12
wait 24 hours a day
05:14
and let me tell you they'd be bored in a
05:15
casket
05:19
if you went right now and laid in the
05:21
casket and shot that lid that's what it
05:22
would be like
05:24
if all of you stayed there but that's
05:26
not what happens it's not what the bible
05:28
says it says to be absent from the body
05:33
that means something moved out of there
05:34
right yes
05:36
it moved out because this is just like a
05:39
covering this is just a little thing
05:40
that you know holds all the stuff
05:41
together inside
05:43
and uh and right now it's temporary
05:45
because when you get it back one day
05:47
it will be glorified it will be
05:51
supernaturally glorified one day and
05:53
everyone who lives in heaven knows
05:54
that's going to happen to them one day
05:57
and it's going to be fantastic but we
05:58
have a mission
06:00
and a commission right now on this earth
06:03
to do things
06:04
never done before we are a supernatural
06:08
people a supernatural generation living
06:11
on this earth
06:13
that was made by the god that we love
06:15
and that we serve
06:16
and they're all excited up there about
06:19
this country
06:20
now i will assure you he loves the world
06:23
the world and the fullness thereof
06:24
belongs to the
06:26
lord it does and he is also very
06:29
interested in what's going on
06:31
he still comes down here a lot he
06:33
appears to a lot of people get messages
06:35
to people
06:35
he actually does it to me a lot also so
06:38
it's not like he moved up there and just
06:39
stayed there forever
06:41
he does go back and forth a lot he does
06:43
come in himself and say things to people
06:46
he's appearing to the jihad
06:51
so how about that's that's that that is
06:53
the
06:55
the i guess the most i don't know how to
06:57
speak
06:58
to introduce them to you but they're not
07:00
normal muslims i'll just tell you that
07:03
uh the jihad many of them are interested
07:06
in wiping out a lot of stuff on the
07:07
earth
07:08
they don't know god they don't know
07:10
jesus christ
07:12
but he is in person coming to them and
07:16
there are a lot of them getting
07:17
saved it's part of shifting nations
07:20
right now and so nothing is going to
07:23
seem to be impossible
07:24
and even what happened in the supreme
07:27
court
07:27
a lot of people would say that was never
07:29
going to happen i knew it was going to
07:31
happen
07:31
because i do know god's plans for this
07:34
country
07:35
and i'm telling you it's going to be
07:37
fantastic to live here
07:40
and at the end of 24 years it will not
07:42
even look like or sound like
07:44
like the same country it will be beyond
07:47
better than it was
07:48
[Applause]
07:52
everywhere in this nation in the most
07:55
unexpected places
07:57
and i'm telling you he's coming to
07:58
consume us in this nation he's going to
08:01
make
08:01
an example for other nations to follow
08:05
if they want god amen that's the pattern
08:08
if they want god and they want success
08:11
they want employment
08:13
for their people if they want their
08:14
people to be free to be safe
08:17
to be prosperous then god's going to
08:19
make our country
08:20
an example of that because of him amen
08:23
and so we've been very much involved in
08:25
the last elections
08:27
and i'm excited about november
08:31
i'm excited about the midterm elections
08:34
it's going to be just like it was before
08:36
it's going to turn the map red
08:49
and i know uh if you watch the fake news
08:55
and let me tell you this people if they
08:57
were smarter
08:59
they wouldn't be beating everyone up and
09:00
accusing them wrongly you know
09:02
they they don't even know what they're
09:03
doing in today's society
09:05
with the internet with twitter you know
09:07
with the podcast
09:09
however we are we're available
09:10
everywhere 24 hours
09:12
a day you can talk to people you know on
09:15
this
09:15
online everything everybody posted but
09:18
you can't hide it anymore
09:20
and that's really a good thing because
09:23
god can't be hidden anymore
09:25
and the righteous things can't be hidden
09:27
and justice and freedom cannot be hidden
09:30
what's being done right can no longer be
09:32
hidden by the other side that doesn't
09:35
want anything good
09:37
really i'm sorry for them sometimes that
09:40
they
09:40
they can't see what they're doing or
09:42
saying they're hurting their self
09:46
and they and what their plan is would
09:47
hurt generations even more
09:50
than what we have been affected already
09:53
and so that's why god put someone in the
09:54
white house
09:56
who knew what to do in the situation who
09:58
wouldn't back down wouldn't be
09:59
bought you know couldn't be used
10:01
couldn't could not you can't put fear in
10:03
him
10:04
and i tell people tonight don't waste
10:06
your time anymore
10:10
you're not going to impeach him not ever
10:14
he will be there for eight years whether
10:16
anybody likes it or not well heaven
10:18
likes it
10:21
and i remember when god said from the
10:23
time he takes the
10:25
the seat in the white house america will
10:26
not have one boring day
10:30
and we haven't have it
10:35
and you know god did anoint him to
10:37
influence
10:39
because the influence he has is for good
10:42
yes
10:43
it is for good he gives a space for god
10:46
whether you know it or not he does know
10:48
him he's still
10:49
new in that but he does he as we see
10:51
jesus christ as the savior i'm talking
10:53
about our president
10:54
and he's very focused on not letting god
10:57
be shut out of our country
11:01
and that alone is just that the
11:04
blessings that come
11:06
upon our country just because he
11:08
recognizes
11:10
there is a god and this country belongs
11:13
to god and i don't know how many times
11:14
he's already said god bless america god
11:16
bless the people
11:17
and i still think one of the most famous
11:19
things he said and his acceptance speak
11:21
to us i'm here to give your country back
11:23
to you
11:26
and i don't remember any other president
11:28
ever saying i'm here to give your
11:29
country back to you
11:30
because you know i don't think a lot of
11:32
people remember it's for the people
11:35
by the people yes is that right
11:39
yeah and so we do have a lot of say i've
11:41
never in my life gotten so many texts
11:44
and surveys never in my life from you
11:46
know you think this solicitor
11:48
at your door you know or all these other
11:50
people calling you on the phone to take
11:52
uh you know asking to do surveys uh our
11:55
president has asked me
11:56
for more than any other company i know
11:59
in america
12:00
has a has sent me a surveys on my phone
12:03
all the time and
12:04
emailed it to me and texted it to me and
12:06
if you're giving me your number you're
12:07
going to get text
12:08
i'll tell you that about everything
12:12
and so he definitely is what god said he
12:14
was that he's an
12:16
all-american boy who was all for
12:19
america and i won't ever stop talking
12:22
about it because god won't let me
12:24
stop talking about him he said my voice
12:27
is going to be heard
12:28
of what i think what i plan and what is
12:31
actually going to happen
12:32
yes and don't listen to what anyone else
12:34
says because i have the final word
12:37
that's my that's my my boy this that i
12:40
put in the white house
12:42
and he said i made him a certain way and
12:44
he was out of
12:45
all of the people in the land right now
12:49
anywhere in this country he was my
12:51
choice
12:53
amen he said i will back it up
12:56
and the people will love him even though
12:58
some may not like that they'll still
13:00
benefit from it
13:01
and there's already been like two
13:03
million jobs created
13:05
amen and our borders are safer they're
13:09
going to get safer
13:10
and i can tell you that part of the
13:12
other side wants
13:14
no borders whatsoever
13:17
that's not wise everybody say that's not
13:20
wise
13:22
i don't want that do you want that no i
13:24
don't either
13:25
because it it protects us right right
13:28
we're not a mean
13:29
hateful special country you can come in
13:31
legally
13:32
yeah we don't say you can't come you
13:34
come illegally so we know
13:36
who is criminals and who are not
13:37
criminals who are terrorists who are not
13:39
terrorists
13:40
because there wouldn't be much of a
13:41
country left amen
13:44
so we have some really good solid plans
13:46
uh
13:47
that would be god and and our government
13:50
right now
13:51
has some really good solid plans for
13:52
this country and i'm really excited
13:54
about it
13:54
uh the prosperity the joy the
13:57
celebration
13:58
uh the holidays being brought back
14:04
i will be celebrating christmas in a big
14:06
way
14:07
we make a birthday cake for jesus we've
14:09
always done that when i was growing up
14:10
we had a birthday cake for jesus
14:13
he likes some honey in it by the way
14:16
but he does love sweets and if you have
14:19
a sweet tooth blanket on him
14:21
or joint heirs with christ remember that
14:27
who would have ever thought
14:33
one thing i have found out in my many
14:36
encounters that i have in heaven
14:39
with god i mean before it was always
14:41
jesus who would walk through the walls
14:42
of my home and
14:44
he'd have me sit down and he would say
14:45
things to me like face to face like i'm
14:47
looking at you
14:48
and uh i had not ever got accustomed to
14:51
that and still get undone but when the
14:53
father
14:54
comes you know uh they have the same
14:57
heart
14:58
they have that same holiness in them but
15:00
when the father comes himself
15:02
it does something to the inside of me
15:04
that my dad
15:06
my my permanently always daddy where i
15:10
lived and who
15:11
who took care of me and held me and it
15:13
says in the bible that he was called you
15:15
know he's called the mini-breasted when
15:16
i'm talking about the father
15:18
he carried us inside of him like a
15:20
mother carries the babies in the womb
15:23
and i love the little things he would
15:25
tell me that he would tell to a little
15:27
child anywhere
15:28
he said you know i put water in the womb
15:31
of the mother
15:32
so it'd be something that would be
15:34
familiar to that baby
15:36
because when you lived in me you played
15:38
in the river of life
15:40
inside of me i never thought of that not
15:43
ever in a million years would i have
15:45
ever
15:45
and yeah i knew that i mean i knew that
15:47
there was water it protects the baby it
15:49
keeps the float you know there's all
15:50
reasons why we have
15:52
and i have birth three children so i
15:54
understand all that
15:55
and uh but i never considered the fact
15:58
even knowing the river of life was
15:59
inside the father
16:01
and it flows out of him it's never
16:03
ending
16:04
you can't see where it comes from at all
16:07
but it's it's
16:08
never ending and we would play inside we
16:10
would swim
16:12
we'd swim under the water run on top of
16:14
the water
16:15
jump on the stones of fire he has this
16:17
massive
16:18
mountain the highest line i've ever seen
16:20
was inside him
16:22
and we would run and slide down that
16:24
mountain from the water flowing in it
16:26
then we would jump on the stones of fire
16:28
and we played we played like little
16:30
children we played
16:32
we didn't have to decide what we were
16:34
going to eat where we were going to live
16:35
you know what we were going to do
16:37
and then we could move out we would jump
16:39
on the rays of the rainbow to come from
16:41
inside
16:41
them they would jump on and we would
16:43
ride in and out on those rays of the
16:46
rainbow because in him
16:48
we lived we moved we had our very
16:51
existence and so and that's what that
16:54
talks about in the scripture
16:56
we came from him everybody came from the
16:59
same place
17:00
we all all people whoever were born on
17:03
this earth
17:04
lived in him first it said in the bible
17:06
he knew us before we were born
17:08
you know he would talk to us he would
17:10
play with us
17:12
because we lived in him that's how he
17:13
could see us that's how he could know us
17:15
he wrote every day of our life in the
17:17
book before he sent us
17:19
how about that and there's other scrolls
17:21
in heaven that talk about
17:23
the plans he has for you and sometimes
17:25
you'll be partnering with the host of
17:27
heaven
17:27
or maybe with gabriel's group and
17:29
helping to bring the body parts down a
17:31
gabriel's group bring those body parts
17:33
down a lot of people have prayed them
17:35
down
17:36
you know and and really that's necessary
17:38
for us to do that we have to invite
17:40
heaven that's why we invite jesus christ
17:44
yes you need to get jesus without asking
17:46
him to come in is that true
17:48
this is some of the most powerful
17:50
revelation i was ever given when i was
17:52
in heaven when he caught me up to heaven
17:54
he said there is a protocol you must
17:57
invite you have to invite my son
18:01
for him to come live in you you're going
18:03
to invite the holy spirit
18:04
to come and indwell you and he says so
18:07
when you invite that gives
18:09
us permission to do something with that
18:12
invitation you have to invite the host
18:15
of heaven
18:15
to be one of your personal weapons that
18:18
will war against the enemy and pull down
18:20
the strongholds around you
18:22
put on strongholds of darkness and uh so
18:25
there's new revelation
18:27
that plan of god that we will actually
18:30
help complete the destiny of the armies
18:32
of heaven
18:33
he's already always had that plan while
18:35
we lived in him
18:37
we weren't even here the earth wasn't
18:38
even here he made plans for that
18:42
because see the the armies of heaven
18:43
can't just go attack
18:45
wherever they want to they're an army
18:49
our army well unless trump's over yeah
18:52
anyway
18:54
most armies just can't go attack what
18:56
they feel like well this is basically
18:57
we're going to take our own weapons
18:59
without any orders from headquarters
19:01
we're just going to go attack wherever
19:02
we want to
19:03
that would not make sense down here are
19:06
the military
19:07
no matter what military or what country
19:10
they all pretty much have the same
19:11
way they handle that they have officers
19:14
over them but first they train them is
19:16
that right
19:17
they get trained and i tell people all
19:20
the time this is a good way to explain
19:22
it to you
19:22
you want to be an airline pilot you go
19:25
apply with delta or american airlines
19:27
you're not going to walk in the next day
19:29
and get your license
19:31
i wouldn't fly on that plane
19:34
our lives as believers it's the same
19:37
thing
19:39
but the angels in heaven it is the same
19:41
way
19:43
they have a protocol of how they operate
19:45
in heaven the government of heaven
19:47
the army of heaven and gabriel's all the
19:50
watcher angels
19:52
and the healing angels and the body
19:54
parts angels
19:55
worker angels scribes i can i can make a
19:58
whole long list
19:59
that are under gabriel one of the
20:02
guardian one of the um
20:04
my mind's going now uh one of the
20:06
archangels thank you holy spirit
20:09
um the archangels are fantastic
20:12
they have a higher level of
20:14
understanding
20:15
of knowledge inside of them because
20:17
they're over like whole
20:19
groups of angels and the hosts actually
20:22
prefer to be called the host
20:26
when it says a great host in the bible
20:28
that's the army
20:30
okay it talks about angels and leaders
20:32
of angels that's usually gabriel's group
20:35
and gabriel's work look beautiful most
20:38
all of gabriel's the angels under him
20:40
look like us you probably couldn't tell
20:43
sometimes if it was an angel or not they
20:45
can hide their wings
20:48
many times i have i don't have arguments
20:51
but people try to argue with me
20:52
that angels don't have wings because
20:54
i've seen them and they don't have any
20:56
and so you didn't see all of them okay
20:59
you didn't see
21:00
all of the all almost every angel i've
21:03
ever known or seen which is probably
21:04
billions of angels at this point
21:06
they all have wings some are made out of
21:08
energy some are made out of color
21:10
some are made of light you know we
21:12
always think they have to have feathers
21:14
you know like a bird and if they don't
21:16
have them they don't have them
21:17
but they're probably invisible some can
21:20
have them when they need them
21:22
and not have them i have news for you
21:24
the father has wings
21:30
so there's jesus he came with healing in
21:34
his
21:40
he does he doesn't always show them
21:45
he does have wings mighty wings the
21:47
father has powerful
21:48
mighty wings you know about psalms 91
21:52
right
21:56
he has wings holy spirit has wings
21:59
the holy spirit is huge he's really tall
22:03
i have never seen him he's invisible but
22:06
he does have an appearance it's the best
22:08
way
22:08
to describe him i used to ask god how do
22:10
i describe him
22:12
he lives in me i hope he lives in you
22:15
holy spirit lives in me he's my best
22:17
friend
22:18
yes and i thank him all the time the
22:20
most simplest things
22:22
i need or i can't find or i don't know
22:26
he'll show me bring it to me or tell me
22:29
without me even asking
22:32
and so he talks to me 24 hours a day
22:36
gets on to me a lot that's what best
22:39
friends do right
22:40
yes and he's also god i don't know why
22:44
people
22:44
want to put him in a different category
22:47
he's god
22:49
he can be worshipped he can be praised
22:52
and so he's part of the trinity they're
22:54
all holy they're all the godhead
22:57
and they are uh even though their
22:59
parents may
23:01
differ a little bit their heart is the
23:02
same they are for
23:04
us they are not against us they have
23:07
more hope
23:08
for us than anyone else in existence
23:11
and so uh they're fantastic
23:14
to to get to know i want everyone here
23:17
to know them
23:18
you know in a in a really awesome way
23:22
and but their goal always is for us to
23:25
be greater
23:27
to be more prosperous to have their
23:29
heart
23:30
to have their understanding to know
23:33
their ways
23:34
to want their will it's really important
23:37
to have those things
23:38
if you're going to be successful in this
23:40
world and when you get to that place the
23:42
devil
23:43
will be terrified of you he's already
23:45
afraid of you
23:47
he doesn't attack you because he's angry
23:50
he attacks because he is very afraid
23:54
he's afraid you'll become you will
23:55
become more and more like them
23:58
amen he really is he doesn't want you to
24:01
have revelation
24:02
he doesn't want you to know how to be
24:04
greater he doesn't want you the devil
24:07
doesn't want you to know how to go in
24:08
the spirit realm and
24:09
or execute the government of god on this
24:11
earth or how your soul to prosper
24:14
especially he's most terrified
24:16
that he does not want your soul to
24:17
prosper he doesn't want you to live in
24:18
divine help
24:19
he doesn't but that's just too bad
24:24
because in this time it'll be normal
24:27
to operate just like that that your soul
24:30
will continue to prosper every day
24:33
that it will not be filled with doom and
24:34
gloom with violence
24:36
with anger with offense all those things
24:39
come from the enemy
24:40
and the less you have them the more
24:44
terrified hell is of you
24:46
and the more blessed god is in heaven
24:49
so in my life i love to bless the lord i
24:53
love to bless the father and i love to
24:55
bless the holy spirit
24:56
i greet them every morning when i wake
24:58
up that's the first thing i
25:00
say and then i kiss my husband goodbye
25:02
so he can go fishing
25:06
and he goes fishing and spends time with
25:08
god that's how he spends his time with
25:09
him
25:10
i mean if it's 14 15 hours and
25:13
smell like bait when he comes home
25:17
not my favorite thing
25:20
but really you can have as much of them
25:22
as you want
25:24
as much as you will choose to pursue
25:26
them and we get so
25:28
busy in this world just trying to live
25:32
sometimes we forget them unless we
25:34
really need something and it's okay
25:36
to ask for help and you need help but
25:39
the whole purpose
25:40
for us to have the host of heaven the
25:42
armies of heaven
25:44
at our personal disposal to use
25:48
is so you won't be running to them all
25:50
the time asking them to rescue you
25:53
to keep you safe because we have that
25:56
ability because of christ
25:58
to do that ourself because we're going
26:02
to a new level we can't live the same
26:04
place we were before you can't
26:06
we go from glory to glory that means
26:08
you're going to a higher level
26:11
of knowing them a higher level of
26:13
dominion and authority a higher level
26:15
of prosperity a higher level of the
26:18
glory
26:19
that is an upward movement that means
26:21
you can't stay here
26:23
we can't be down here anymore being
26:24
crushed by the enemy
26:27
he is under our feet
26:29
[Applause]
26:32
i'm gonna make doormats and say hell is
26:34
our doormat
26:38
that's the way we need to think if we
26:41
always walk around
26:42
filled with fear or confusion
26:45
or anger then we can't go to those
26:48
levels
26:50
so that's why god is sending some of the
26:52
greatest revelation
26:53
this is my introduction i'm going to
26:54
talk about america but this is the holy
26:56
spirit's introduction i'll just say that
26:58
the holy spirit always has an
26:59
introduction
27:01
because there's always new people who
27:03
how many people this first time you've
27:04
ever heard
27:04
me anybody bless them jesus
27:08
just take your natural mind and set it
27:10
on a shelf you'll be fine
27:13
because i talk about spiritual things
27:16
now i walk in the spirit amen
27:20
so i don't walk in the flesh
27:23
i don't have personal opinions
27:26
i have their revelation
27:29
and i live by it i can't tell you these
27:32
things if i have not
27:35
lived them myself and it does make a
27:38
difference but what i'm sharing
27:40
to you is a lifestyle
27:43
it's not a cafeteria
27:46
if you can live on earth like they do in
27:49
heaven
27:50
that means you'll have to make some
27:51
changes in your life
27:55
you walk in the spirit what does that
27:56
mean that's a place
27:58
it's a place by the way new revelation
28:02
john was in the spirit why did he say
28:06
that
28:08
why did that why didn't even get put in
28:09
the bible why was that in the bible
28:12
they could have just said he heard and
28:13
was caught up that's not how it starts
28:16
he was in the spirit it was the way he
28:19
lived
28:20
how he processed god the way he
28:22
responded to everything
28:25
he lived a spiritual life that doesn't
28:28
mean
28:28
you walk around so you know so serious
28:32
and sour
28:33
and that's not even what holy is holy is
28:36
absent of sin
28:39
it's an absence of sin that's not hard
28:43
amen so john lived
28:46
this way that he would hear the voice of
28:48
the lord he always obeyed
28:49
he was always willing to do what he
28:51
wanted and he kept him on this earth
28:54
he could still be here if he wanted to
28:57
but he missed
28:59
heaven remember he went there
29:04
you never forget it when he was caught
29:07
up so he was
29:07
in that that place in his heart he was
29:10
in the spirit
29:11
on the lord's day and when they because
29:14
they said that
29:15
i don't think he was even on the isle of
29:18
patmos
29:20
that was supposed to be his prison they
29:22
put him there
29:24
because they were so afraid of him they
29:27
couldn't kill him
29:29
they tried more than three times they
29:31
tried to kill him all the time
29:32
it never worked
29:36
it never worked because this was what
29:39
god was doing
29:40
with him he was allowing him to stay
29:41
here as long as he wanted
29:43
he would fill him with things all the
29:45
time
29:47
so he was already sharing and doing what
29:49
god had told him
29:50
and i'm sure what jesus taught him he
29:53
would go in the spirit
29:54
in the spirit realm and he would appear
29:55
before the sanhedrin
29:58
when he felt like it even after he was
30:02
sent to the alabamas they didn't want
30:03
him to talk to people
30:05
they didn't want him around people he
30:06
was way too weird they couldn't kill
30:08
this guy
30:09
you know what are we going to do we need
30:11
to put him somewhere so we're safe
30:15
he couldn't make you know any
30:16
interruption or disruption
30:18
which happened every time he would
30:19
appear somewhere he already had that
30:22
revelation of going in the spirit
30:24
and so he was in the spirit on the
30:26
lord's day
30:27
and that door open he heard that voice
30:29
he recognized that voice
30:31
and then he was taken up and saw heaven
30:34
saw god the father sitting on the throne
30:36
with the rainbow around him
30:39
he saw him
30:42
[Laughter]
30:45
and so he was showing him he saw the
30:47
very person that he would say
30:48
in the book of john you cannot see the
30:50
face of god and live
30:51
and yet in the book of revelation he saw
30:53
him and saw the face of god and lived
30:56
because this was about a new
30:57
relationship when you receive jesus
31:00
christ
31:01
you can see the face of god and live
31:05
you can see it you're not going to be
31:07
any different when you go to heaven
31:09
if you have christ in you then you're
31:11
righteous
31:13
you have entrance into heaven not just
31:16
when you die
31:20
sometimes god will catch people up even
31:22
even unsaved people
31:23
just so they can have an encounter and
31:25
they freak out they come back and then
31:27
they want to receive
31:28
jesus christ that's happening a lot too
31:31
he's not just
31:32
catching up believers and so you can
31:35
have an encounter
31:36
with the living god with jesus christ
31:39
the holy spirit a lot of us have already
31:40
had
31:41
he's definitely strange
31:44
he loves drama in case you wonder why we
31:47
have drama when we receive the holy
31:49
spirit there's a lot of drama
31:51
i love a story that was told a long time
31:53
ago i think it was probably back in the
31:54
50s
31:55
40s and this church was experiencing
32:00
the holy spirit just moving on everybody
32:02
but their pianist
32:03
was the most proper person in the church
32:07
and she wore white every sunday to show
32:09
how holy she was
32:11
and she sit there and play the most
32:13
common alcohol tunes on her organ
32:17
and she was never moved or touched and
32:19
everybody was like falling out there
32:21
rolling on the floor they were speaking
32:22
in tongues you know and she thinks i'm
32:24
just going to remain rapper
32:26
until one sunday church was passed
32:30
they all wanted to come and see what was
32:31
going on and the holy spirit just
32:33
totally invaded her
32:37
she jumped off of the off of the
32:40
bench and did flips she
32:43
hit the pipe of the wood stove
32:48
sit like a cloud came over her
32:51
it covered her white outfit all the way
32:53
to her feet
32:55
stuck in her hair it got on her face she
32:57
went up and down the aisle just yelling
32:59
in tongues back and forth did not care
33:02
at all so there was drama
33:06
in that church that day that's right
33:08
this is a true story and she never was
33:10
the same
33:11
after that she loved everybody
33:14
she's saying she's singing tongues
33:16
sometimes you know
33:17
and so let me tell you you can try to
33:19
avoid it all you want to
33:22
but they're going to come a day when the
33:24
spirit of god would touch all flesh
33:27
amen without permission
33:32
in the last days i will pour out my
33:34
spirit on what
33:39
and people who never prophesied before
33:42
never had visions before never dreamed
33:43
they're going to do it
33:44
that's right it could be people walking
33:46
out of walmart get hit by the holy
33:48
spirit this is the picture you need to
33:50
have not just everybody sitting in a
33:51
church and
33:52
happening it's going to happen in the
33:53
streets in the restaurants in the
33:55
grocery store
33:56
you know the holy spirit's not going to
33:57
go oh i should wait until they come out
34:02
now he's the most excited being in all
34:04
existence right now
34:07
the greatest show on earth
34:11
will be when the spirit of god is loose
34:13
on all
34:15
[Applause]
34:18
and people who know flesh a believer
34:20
they'll all be beating your door down
34:23
calling you on the phone what just
34:24
happened to me what happened what
34:25
happened what happened
34:27
i can't stop shaking i'm crying i'm
34:28
laughing
34:31
i need to know who jesus is i know you
34:32
know him yes
34:37
it's going to happen it hasn't happened
34:40
yet
34:40
the baptism in fire is going to come
34:43
right after that
34:45
that is a separate baptism yes it's the
34:48
fire that comes from god the father
34:50
himself it will not be very long away
34:55
i don't have dates for everything but i
34:57
can tell you this just because of what's
34:59
already happening
35:01
in the world and there's signs that you
35:04
will see signs that things are changing
35:06
and it's not going to be the same well
35:08
the very trump got elected was a sign
35:12
okay something new is happening god's
35:14
actually going to do exactly what he
35:16
wants no matter what the whole world is
35:17
saying
35:19
no matter what comes up against him it's
35:20
just not going to make any difference
35:22
because
35:22
you're fighting god and all those
35:25
democrats
35:26
were fighting god about kavanaugh
35:30
because god was on his side he
35:33
wants change in the justice department
35:44
so god has a lot of things that that are
35:46
just starting on the earth for the first
35:48
time
35:49
yeah and we get to do that yes he's not
35:52
just going to do everything himself
35:53
he wants you to do them
35:56
now you probably thought your whole life
35:58
you're going to sit on a seat and go
35:59
home and have a good sunday dinner and
36:02
watch football or you know go play with
36:05
your kids or whatever you do
36:06
and then i'll go back next sunday
36:10
your life won't be like that anymore
36:13
you won't it'll be a lot more exciting
36:16
it'll be powerful there'll be many
36:18
things required of you
36:19
and in order for you to carry the glory
36:23
the absolute power of the living god
36:26
yes to when you walk into places things
36:29
are shifted
36:31
like hundreds and thousands of people
36:34
like land where nothing grew before
36:36
produce will come up you go out and stop
36:38
the earthquakes and then they can put it
36:40
back
36:41
you raise the dead that will cremate it
36:43
yes these are greater works
36:46
see all these are things that are
36:47
mentioned in the bible but i think some
36:49
pastors forget them because
36:51
a lot of them are just talking about
36:52
escaping
36:54
and that's not what's going to happen
36:57
that's why the holy spirit told me
36:59
to make things that said roll up your
37:01
rapture rug
37:04
remember the first time you said okay
37:06
you're going to the church are you going
37:07
to say tell everybody roll up the raptor
37:08
rugged one
37:09
okay
37:13
roll up your rapture rug he said i
37:15
didn't tell you to occupy that
37:20
that's not money man jesus said occupy
37:22
until i come
37:24
that doesn't mean go sit somewhere in
37:26
the woods with the raccoons
37:29
and the sea rations and it doesn't mean
37:31
sitting under wraps or rugging your corn
37:33
or not doing ever doing anything but
37:34
waiting to get out of this awful place
37:36
he expects us to change it
37:40
with the power of god revelation
37:44
us surrendering our life
37:47
you know when you get saved when you get
37:48
born again the light of god is put in
37:51
you
37:51
your name is written in this massive
37:53
book in heaven the book of
37:55
life the angels always record it when
37:59
people get born again
38:00
they're always recording it as evidence
38:03
they take it to heaven they don't have
38:05
to but they want to
38:06
god takes a stone of fire from himself
38:08
and puts it in your
38:10
spirit man and that's when you have
38:12
light
38:14
that's where the light comes from jesus
38:16
takes a portion of his anointing a
38:18
measure of the anointing
38:19
walking on the earth and he deposits it
38:22
in you
38:24
that's in first down 227 if you wonder
38:27
where that is
38:29
so you get something you get deposits
38:31
and things put in you
38:32
to make you supernatural and then it
38:35
gives you revelation
38:37
especially when there's a new time we
38:40
have new ways
38:41
we have understanding of our weapons if
38:43
we have been using them
38:45
that armor of god he told you to put on
38:47
it is powerful
38:49
if you're going into a strange place
38:51
where you know people use like really
38:52
bad language or stuff going on
38:54
before you go in that door you need to
38:56
lift up my shield of faith it will block
38:58
and quench
38:58
every fiery dart of the enemy those are
39:01
words propane words
39:03
like people screaming yelling hating it
39:05
won't penetrate you
39:07
that's what that shield does
39:10
all of those parts of your armor are
39:12
important but when you have revelation
39:13
they're even more powerful and now he's
39:17
adding on top of that
39:19
the the destiny of the army of heaven
39:22
to operate as our weapon and we command
39:26
them
39:27
because god himself said command he me
39:31
he didn't say tell me what to do what he
39:33
was saying was you say
39:35
what is going to happen if we are kings
39:39
and priests we have authority
39:41
we have a voice to speak we have a voice
39:44
to speak into the atmosphere
39:46
into the spirit realm against any evil
39:49
no matter where it is we have power over
39:51
all the power of the enemy
39:53
he gave us powerful weapons his word is
39:55
powerful
39:56
his name the demons hate his name
40:01
they remember who he was and he wasted
40:03
hell on the third day and noted the
40:05
faces of the
40:06
principalities and powers
40:10
and they can't change it they can't fix
40:13
themselves
40:14
when something happens from a born-again
40:18
powerful believer filled with jesus
40:21
christ
40:22
you are dangerous that and i know you i
40:25
talk a lot about the authority because
40:26
the body needs to know they have it
40:28
yes and i could talk about all the love
40:30
of god and i did that for years
40:32
how much you love them he believes your
40:34
father you know he wants he wants you to
40:36
know his mercy and his goodness and he
40:38
does
40:39
he wants you to be blessed beyond
40:40
measure and he does but he wants to know
40:43
the other part of it
40:47
jesus is a warrior he's a king right now
40:52
i don't picture him as a little a
40:54
shepherd holding a little lamb in his
40:55
arms anymore
40:57
i see him with those crowns on his head
41:00
and his flings of fire and
41:02
that sword that comes unless you divide
41:04
things asunder
41:05
i see him that way he is my king
41:09
he is the king of spiritual kings
41:14
we are the spiritual kings
41:20
[Music]
41:23
so this is a new lifestyle for you
41:26
what i share with you is not just one
41:29
little thing that's going to help you or
41:30
another little thing
41:31
if you live without revelation
41:35
it's a lifestyle i mean the host of
41:38
heaven
41:39
hearken unto the voice of the lord and
41:42
he's in
41:43
us when we speak and give them commands
41:45
to go do things put on strongholds of
41:47
darkness crush
41:48
it push it back they do it because they
41:50
recognize
41:52
that voice in us but if you as a
41:54
believer are playing in sin
41:57
you may as well put an ego target on you
41:58
you're going to get tapped that's right
42:01
you can't go forward in the kingdom
42:04
that's right
42:05
and then you step back by playing or
42:09
partnering with help you're stepping
42:10
back
42:11
you see that you're stepping back and
42:14
you're flashing into the way you were
42:15
before
42:16
and you're partnering with the enemy
42:18
well that means man they were beating me
42:20
up now i'm coming after them
42:21
yes that's right someone actually asked
42:23
a question
42:25
at our table why do i get attacked a lot
42:26
i feel like they got a big target on me
42:29
well i i didn't answer that question but
42:31
my first thing was how have you been
42:32
living
42:34
have you been treating people what have
42:37
you been saying
42:38
what's in your layers good
42:41
because you have to be filled with the
42:43
light like we we are
42:45
the kingdom of light we are against the
42:48
kingdom of darkness
42:50
so if you get sucked into that kingdom
42:52
of darkness that means
42:54
you stepped back and you are not fit for
42:58
the kingdom is that what that scripture
42:59
says
43:00
if you go forward in the kingdom don't
43:03
step
43:04
back or you will not be fit for the
43:06
kingdom it's like an
43:07
athlete who's practicing for the
43:09
olympics for like 10 years they've been
43:11
doing they finally get their time
43:13
three months away and they decide i'm
43:15
just going to stop all this i'm tired of
43:17
practicing
43:18
i don't want to practice i don't want to
43:19
do this i'm tired i'm taking a break
43:22
do you think they would win in the
43:23
olympics they wouldn't be any use to
43:26
themselves
43:27
or their team they would not be fit
43:30
to compete that's what he means when he
43:33
says you will not be
43:34
fit for the kingdom because your level
43:36
of authority went down
43:38
when you gave it away to the enemy
43:42
that's that's not god doing that that's
43:44
your choice
43:46
with your will amen
43:50
so don't step back if you go forward
43:52
with this you got to keep going forward
43:54
heaven is a forward motion it's not a
43:57
back and forth
43:58
i'm going here and i'm going to go back
44:00
and i'm going here
44:01
oh no i got to go back and he'll forgive
44:04
you for all of it
44:05
to forgive you always
44:08
but he can't put you back up here
44:12
if you were there and you step back
44:15
either by going into sin or by hating
44:17
people
44:18
and bashing and crushing them all the
44:20
time
44:21
that's not heaven's words you're not
44:23
giving life
44:24
it says choose life or death you're
44:26
giving death
44:28
so that means you're stepping back then
44:29
the place you were in going forward in
44:31
the light
44:32
you're making conquest sending the host
44:34
to put on strongholds
44:35
mess up the isis
44:39
they get messed up you can't go
44:42
forward and and the host will listen to
44:45
you
44:46
as long as you're going forward in the
44:47
light and there's not darkness in you
44:50
because they can't partner with darkness
44:53
they were sent by the lord they are a
44:56
weapon
44:56
a mighty weapon to the pulling down of
44:59
strongholds
45:00
we don't fight the enemy we're already
45:04
conquerors
45:06
that as kings and priests and the
45:07
kingdom we do have an army
45:10
amen it's the nose no difference in our
45:14
own military if we had great generals
45:16
and they were getting all these troops
45:17
to go forward making conquest
45:18
taking land taking territory and they
45:21
decided to go partner with the very
45:22
enemy they're fighting
45:24
and they give out secret information and
45:27
tell
45:28
for well some of our troops are stuff
45:29
like that do you think
45:31
they are going to be any good to this
45:34
military that they've been taking
45:35
forward
45:41
we have to see it that way that we can
45:44
no longer participate
45:46
with the enemy and do not let
45:49
fear rule you that's right that's right
45:52
one of the reasons
45:53
why our president is so successful
45:57
is he does not have fear in him
46:01
he doesn't have fear he's made major
46:04
plans
46:05
everything within his being wants to see
46:07
those plans happen
46:08
he really loves his country and he
46:11
really loves the people
46:14
and just because people have twisted and
46:16
lied about but he doesn't care what
46:18
they're saying he's not wasting his time
46:21
he's not running back trying to pull out
46:22
stuff no no no no he is going forward
46:25
which terrifies the enemy and we should
46:29
have an example we have jesus christ for
46:32
example but our very president should be
46:34
an example to all of us
46:35
if you want to achieve the destiny and
46:38
the goal you have in your life
46:40
you can't let everybody here or here
46:42
pull you back
46:43
drag you off the path get you caught
46:45
into other things you have to stay
46:46
focused
46:47
amen and have fun while you're doing it
46:50
that's right
46:51
man so today the victory that happened
46:55
in our country
46:57
and this is what that victory meant all
46:59
of heaven is celebrating kavanaugh
47:02
being put on the supreme court this is
47:04
why they're celebrating
47:07
and i'm sitting there god says pouring
47:09
this all stuff into me
47:10
and i watched it when they confirmed him
47:13
and i kept telling people i don't care
47:14
what they're saying i don't have time to
47:16
listen to the other side
47:18
i don't i know that god has positioned
47:21
this country
47:22
for greatness for blessings for justice
47:27
which is written on one of the steps of
47:28
his very throne
47:31
the word justice is there this is our
47:34
season and time for justice
47:37
especially as believers but also for our
47:40
country this
47:40
is a time of justice liberty
47:44
and freedom and that's what
47:48
he stood for that's what kavanaugh stood
47:50
for
47:51
and so they found someone to pay them to
47:54
lie
47:56
with not one shred of evidence no
48:00
evidence
48:04
even his own children did not believe
48:07
the lies about him
48:09
they lived with him they knew his
48:11
character they knew that he loved god
48:14
and god picked him like he put trump and
48:16
he kept telling me i don't care what
48:17
they say he is sitting on the supreme
48:19
court
48:19
he's going to wipe out rogue versus way
48:21
he's going to give life to baby
48:26
and when i'm sitting there today in the
48:28
hotel room he kept showing me letting me
48:30
see
48:31
all these millions of babies who have
48:35
been aborted and have
48:36
hearings that are in heaven they sang
48:39
and celebrated
48:44
as they were saying yes he was going to
48:46
sit on the screen
48:47
this is what they knew that life would
48:50
change for all the babies
48:53
in america that no longer
48:56
illegal to take their lives and wipe
48:59
them away like dust
49:00
like they had that and they have
49:04
forgiven all those people there's no
49:06
anger in their little souls they're free
49:08
they forgive
49:09
everybody the people who performed it
49:12
the people who allowed it
49:13
the people who voted for that to be
49:15
legal they forgave every person but
49:17
today
49:18
they had a party in heaven and they
49:21
celebrated the other babies
49:24
being conceived in the womb one day
49:27
we'll never have to fear the life being
49:28
taken
49:30
and they'll get to complete their
49:31
destiny on this earth so there was a big
49:33
party in heaven today
49:36
because of that and then and the father
49:38
began to tell me
49:39
he said yes we now have there is now god
49:43
in the white house
49:46
because he's welcomed and allowed to be
49:48
there and he said
49:49
and now i have permission to be in the
49:52
supreme court
49:53
because of cavanaugh as a believer being
49:56
sit on that vent sitting on the bench of
49:57
the supreme court he said now
49:59
i have the right to speak into the court
50:02
system
50:04
and he said because of that i have
50:06
assigned
50:07
three special ops angels
50:12
see i'll never just tell you something
50:14
you're going to get details
50:17
he has a sign of three powerful angels
50:20
host of the host and they're called
50:22
their names are justice
50:24
liberty and freedom and they are
50:27
assigned to protect and keep
50:29
kavanaugh on his family and they're also
50:31
assigned to help him
50:34
bring justice liberty and freedom to
50:37
this country
50:44
in the supreme court and he said he was
50:48
just the first
50:49
put in there he said there are more to
50:51
follow
50:52
and everyone that's nominated will win
50:54
the nomination he said because i'm
50:56
involved in that amen
51:00
so this is really a time for us to
51:02
celebrate god's hand moving
51:04
again divinely moving
51:08
against all the stuff that was
51:10
manufactured
51:12
paid to happen and as much as possible
51:15
they would spend all their time on the
51:16
fake news
51:17
telling the fake stuff and it didn't
51:20
stop it
51:21
it didn't stop it from happening god
51:23
said and
51:25
again in the midterm elections
51:28
that map will be turned red amen
51:33
okay because i did not invest myself
51:36
in trump and putting him in the office
51:38
only to have halfway through his term
51:40
have everything taken away he said that
51:41
it will not happen
51:46
so there's some prophecy for you
51:50
going to be great you just have to watch
51:53
stop watching jumps
51:56
and a lot of people do not understand
51:58
they think the whole end is here
52:00
we actually had somebody i don't know if
52:02
they message me or commented i don't
52:04
know what they did
52:05
um what the hell they said it to me they
52:07
said that you are absolutely wrong you
52:08
need to stop
52:09
talking about all these good things
52:10
happening because this is the last day
52:14
and there is no time for those things to
52:16
happen
52:19
i want to say maybe not on your clock or
52:21
calendar
52:23
but we're living on god's timeline right
52:25
now amen
52:26
and i said i will not ever stop saying
52:28
these things because
52:29
they will happen yes amen
52:33
god's going to make sure his voice stays
52:36
spoken
52:37
in this world so you know what's going
52:40
to happen amen
52:43
you should hear him that clearly
52:47
if your heart is to pursue him to have
52:50
that
52:50
you're going to have it you can't escape
52:52
having his voice
52:54
you can't he's not a respecter of
52:56
persons we all
52:57
have the ability to prophesy the bible
53:01
say
53:01
all they prophesied does that say that
53:04
yes
53:05
so he said desire the best gifts
53:08
that's a best gift you hear how
53:12
god's voice and then speak it for him
53:14
and let me tell you go
53:15
how do i know he's saying something you
53:16
feel like you're going to explode inside
53:19
yeah it really does happen that way when
53:22
i first started doing that
53:23
it would like begin to burn and then it
53:24
felt like my whole body was going to
53:26
explode and the longer i waited to say
53:28
something and the whole time the holy
53:29
spirit is saying open your mouth open
53:30
your mouth
53:32
i don't know what to say open your mouth
53:35
you gotta open your mouth step up and
53:37
open your mouth
53:39
there were no real lessons about that
53:41
but i just honestly say open your mouth
53:46
and say it to whoever it's for and make
53:48
sure it's supposed to be spoken
53:50
sometimes god shares things with you so
53:52
you can pray
53:53
right so you have to discern is this
53:56
something that i can say in love
53:58
that will help them change or am i
54:01
wanting to do this because my flesh is
54:03
really happy i can bash them
54:06
god doesn't bash he shares he gives
54:09
correction
54:11
and then direction but he does it in
54:13
love
54:14
man so what i have is good news
54:18
i have good news for us good news for
54:20
america and not only that the countries
54:23
he's
54:23
shifting around this world like korea
54:26
and that will be one
54:28
land it will be one country without
54:30
communism or a war
54:34
people are thinking that's just not
54:35
going to happen without a war i went yes
54:37
it
54:37
is it will happen because this is god's
54:40
plan
54:42
and if he can shift the mind
54:45
and the focus of that north america
54:47
north korean president
54:50
then it will happen and while i was in
54:53
korea
54:53
i was there to do eight meetings in 10
54:55
days
54:57
i lost like 15 pounds
55:00
yesterday
55:04
seafood yes
55:09
the brazil nuts were really good
55:13
the pretzels brazil nuts and oranges is
55:15
what i ate for 10 days
55:18
but they were delicious as long as i
55:21
didn't have to eat the tea
55:22
[Laughter]
55:24
and god said i'm going to date him this
55:26
is back before i'm going to bait
55:29
he just called him kim i'm going to bake
55:32
him
55:32
with big business and everybody's going
55:35
to wipe him out and get him off the face
55:36
of the earth
55:38
or else he would do that himself
55:39
actually god said if i wait much longer
55:42
he may blow himself
55:43
up because their stuff doesn't work well
55:48
he didn't want him to blow himself up he
55:50
was not happy with what he's doing
55:52
but guess what his soul was filled with
55:54
that stuff by his own father
55:57
it was filled from the time he's little
55:59
war war war war
56:00
war and so what did he know war he
56:03
didn't know what well
56:05
but that's what he knew so god said i'm
56:07
going to shift his
56:08
heart and focus to big business
56:12
and he will want to do the business when
56:14
he sees it
56:15
so he used the olympics
56:18
as bait here's south korea
56:22
making millions of dollars
56:25
from people all over the world coming
56:29
to see those olympics
56:33
and when the person who sent there to
56:34
check it out came back and said do you
56:35
know what
56:36
there is no fear they don't have fear
56:39
all those people coming to visit and
56:41
they're all applauding and yelling and
56:43
cheering
56:44
and they're spending money and spending
56:45
money and spending money
56:49
but no one's afraid because they're
56:52
happy
56:53
they're celebrating something we don't
56:55
even think about
57:00
i don't think they had a team did they
57:02
anyway
57:03
they weren't thinking in that way
57:05
because the mind of their leader was not
57:07
even considering that would be possible
57:11
he was actually in fear that's why he
57:13
was always wanting a war and wipe out
57:15
people before they got and he was
57:17
living with fear in him and god said i'm
57:19
shifting him
57:20
to consider doing big business and
57:23
that's what his focus is
57:26
he still has a lot of changes i'm not by
57:28
any means saying he is perfect
57:29
but his focus has shifted
57:33
amen and if people don't like it they've
57:35
been around him
57:36
they won't last very long
57:40
because he already has seen evidence
57:42
that you can have a different life
57:45
so don't don't consider don't just
57:47
consider that no one you know all things
57:49
are possible with god
57:50
and that's not the only country he's
57:52
going to do that to
57:54
he's going to shift governments and then
57:57
when he shifts the government
57:58
he will shape the nations
58:02
and doors will open for us to go and
58:04
share the gospel where we never
58:06
could before and it's going to be a long
58:10
window not a short few weeks or months
58:14
there's people that believe what i say
58:16
but there's one thing they don't agree
58:17
with
58:18
they think that the rafters coming in
58:19
about three months but they said that
58:21
six years ago i went just
58:25
no we don't want to discuss that right
58:26
now i'm discussing what is the now time
58:28
of god
58:29
that's the future you can't change it
58:32
you can't make it happen
58:34
you don't know that day so how about if
58:36
we just agree together to do what god
58:37
wants us to do now
58:39
amen amen so one of the focuses on
58:42
heaven is to shift nations
58:44
that is by reaching the leaders of those
58:45
nations or removing that leader
58:48
and putting one in there that will be
58:50
shifted
58:51
so you're going to see a lot of activity
58:53
around this world especially in
58:55
governments
58:56
and some of them may not be the ones you
58:58
expected to do something
59:00
but korea is a good example
59:03
because this i know there's wars and
59:04
rumors of wars there'll be more rumors
59:07
than wars
59:09
and when something like that happens it
59:11
won't be a long one
59:14
because the other side will be dealt
59:15
with swiftly and quickly
59:18
because this is a different time on the
59:20
earth well how can you talk like that
59:23
because it's what god is saying this is
59:25
what he wants
59:26
now we're not living the way we did 50
59:30
years ago or even 20 years ago we're not
59:32
living that way
59:33
we have a whole new way we could live
59:35
called heaven culture
59:38
and there's a way you live that we're
59:39
not automatically
59:41
just going to be showered with little
59:42
fuzzy things and the next day
59:44
everybody's going to live on earth like
59:45
they did in heaven
59:47
we have to be living examples of that
59:50
and people will see our lives we'll be a
59:52
living testimony on this earth
59:55
and you can have a life like they do in
59:57
heaven and what is that like no fear
60:00
no wars no hate no laugh no sickness no
60:03
disease
60:05
excitement joy celebration adventure
60:08
the presence of god everywhere in your
60:10
life
60:12
that's the way they live in heaven
60:14
that's heaven culture
60:16
honor is given to people
60:19
no one is rejected there's no offense
60:22
there's no regrets there's no worry
60:26
about
60:26
regrets in heaven no one's going to be
60:28
feeling feel like that they were crushed
60:30
down because they didn't do right on
60:31
this earth
60:33
you remember your life but you use it to
60:36
the glory of god and what he did and how
60:38
much he loved you
60:39
to make sure you got there amen amen
60:42
so this is this is a whole new time and
60:44
he's not saying
60:46
you can't come if you're in this
60:47
denomination
60:50
if you have to be in this denomination
60:51
too common to be a part of this
60:53
otherwise you just can't come that's not
60:56
from heaven either
60:58
no there's one requirement
61:01
if you receive and believe in your heart
61:05
that jesus christ died for your sins and
61:07
you repent for those sins and he
61:10
washes you inside with a shower of his
61:13
blood and wipes all that away like it
61:15
never happened
61:16
and you are counted righteous and your
61:19
name is written in the lamb's book of
61:20
life
61:22
then your whole focus should change with
61:26
god's focus on you
61:28
because people who are not believers
61:31
cannot do these things
61:33
they do not have power over the part of
61:35
the enemy the host will not listen to
61:37
anyone who is a non-believer they're not
61:39
going to listen to them
61:40
they can see inside of everybody you
61:42
either have light
61:43
or you have gray or you have darkness
61:48
in your soul that's what's there there's
61:49
either light
61:51
darkness or gray you don't want gray
61:55
amen and the enemy because those are
61:59
spiritual beings they see spiritual
62:01
things about you
62:04
now i don't give them any ammunition i'm
62:06
not giving them any ammunition
62:08
i have ammunition i'm going to focus on
62:09
them
62:11
but with all that you get with what god
62:14
has planned for us right now
62:16
you also can have uh your greatest
62:19
desires in your heart yes that are for
62:22
good
62:23
it will be his pleasure to give those to
62:25
you amen
62:27
when you start operating like this when
62:30
you start pursuing heaven culture
62:32
your needs become this is what he
62:34
personally told me
62:35
your knees become his responsibility
62:38
and your desires become his pleasure
62:42
the people living in utter darkness who
62:45
don't know any of this
62:46
they see no hope they don't even think
62:49
they have a future
62:51
that's why it's important for us to be a
62:53
living testimony amen
62:56
and we live in one of the greatest
62:57
countries in this world
63:00
we do another country's focusing on is
63:03
is of course
63:03
israel and i knew something major was
63:06
going to happen in israel god said i'm
63:08
going to bless them every time they get
63:09
attacked
63:10
every time someone threatens to attack
63:13
them i'm going to bless
63:14
israel they're going to walk in favor
63:17
with me
63:19
divine favor with me and i will give
63:21
great friends
63:22
who are jews to americans who know me
63:27
and they will do big business together
63:30
and jews know how to do big business
63:32
trust me
63:34
he said i will bless them above measure
63:37
and it will protect them and it will
63:38
keep them
63:39
they will not be wiped out he said
63:42
america belongs to me
63:44
and now the greatest friends is the the
63:47
one who
63:47
who is over israel the one who's over
63:50
america
63:51
are now great friends together and so
63:54
both blessed both will be greatly
63:56
blessed because of this so you can
63:58
see more blessings coming and for the
64:00
first time in a long
64:02
time because a lot of the warring has
64:05
stopped
64:06
because now of course you know of course
64:08
our embassy's over there
64:11
and israel's embassy has been shifted to
64:13
where it should have always been
64:14
yeah and i mean trump pretty much said
64:17
if you attack them you're attacking us
64:19
we will come after you because he's
64:22
he is serious about being friends with
64:24
his
64:31
not going to give billions of dollars
64:32
away to our enemies
64:34
amen so justice is coming
64:39
to this country to our lives
64:42
and there's a whole atmosphere of
64:44
justice that was actually just shifted
64:46
into our country
64:47
because of the supreme court
64:53
more and more you will see justice for
64:55
believers who get dragged into court
64:58
who have court cases uh and they're
65:00
innocent
65:01
more and more you will hear because in
65:03
the past you'd always hear
65:04
they've either taken it somewhere else
65:06
you're going to retry it they found
65:08
something else
65:08
you actually hear real justice being
65:10
given to them
65:12
amen so this is a real powerful time a
65:16
time to celebrate and to be joyful
65:18
for us and if you have family members
65:20
that don't
65:21
like you know our president just pray
65:24
for them
65:25
and let them love them and let them live
65:26
their life they're still going to
65:28
benefit from all of it anyway
65:29
and i have found this to be true you
65:31
yourself probably can't change their
65:33
mind
65:35
a lot of people wear themself out
65:38
trying to prove to their family members
65:40
that they need jesus
65:43
and it's probably going to be someone
65:44
else in this world that does that not
65:46
you
65:47
pray for them hug them love them let
65:49
them know you love them you're praying
65:51
for them
65:52
but don't get into fights every time you
65:53
come together
65:55
okay make sure you have time for love
65:58
for
65:58
family and you may notice a little bit
66:00
of change in them if they don't think
66:02
every time you come it's going to come
66:03
up
66:04
get in your prayer closet send the host
66:07
of heaven against the demonic trying to
66:08
control their lives
66:10
release the anointing into them that's
66:12
what breaks the yoke of darkness over
66:14
them
66:15
there are things that you can do but
66:17
don't waste your whole life
66:19
that's right you know trying to convince
66:21
somebody
66:22
that doesn't want that you cannot make
66:25
them take it amen
66:27
it has to be a choice i do know that
66:30
major restorations are coming from
66:32
families who've been apart for years
66:35
and you may see a lot of that happening
66:36
this christmas especially
66:39
this christmas god's marking is a time a
66:41
major time for restoration and family
66:43
members to break down those barriers
66:45
between them
66:46
so you can expect to hear about that
66:48
happening or you might have that happen
66:50
yourself
66:51
that god's in that time in in that
66:53
christmas christmas season
66:55
will be a time of great restoration for
66:58
families in this earth so
67:00
and heaven does heaven does like
67:02
christmas by the way
67:04
[Music]
67:05
you wouldn't make christmas town in
67:12
heaven
67:14
if you've never heard the truth about uh
67:18
nicholas and how he lived his life when
67:21
he was on this earth
67:22
you don't really know what he was like
67:24
he was not
67:25
a necessarily the happiest person in the
67:27
world
67:28
he was tough he was hard
67:32
and he did not like anyone who spoke
67:33
against the gospel he would take his
67:35
staff and use it for other purposes
67:37
yes go watch saving christmas
67:43
oh yeah i think um kirk cameron
67:46
kirk cameron made a movie called saving
67:48
christmas everybody should look that up
67:50
and watch it
67:52
you should watch it he tells the true
67:54
story he tells the true story about
67:56
nick or nicholas and how his life was
67:59
back in his day and it is quite humorous
68:02
but it's quite true
68:04
and you see a whole different way to
68:06
explain christmas or celebrate christmas
68:09
but god loves it he loves all the lights
68:12
he likes the gift giving
68:14
he loves the fact that sometimes it is
68:16
the only time
68:18
in someone's life that they forgive yes
68:21
it is sometimes it's the only time of
68:24
the year
68:24
that they actually give money to others
68:27
to help them
68:29
amen it is really it's not something bad
68:32
that link
68:32
everything to some satanic ritual that
68:35
was way back when but i have news for
68:37
you heaven was there
68:38
before all that stuff was here and all
68:40
the enemy did was he takes it he
68:42
copycats it
68:43
and so that it looks like it's all evil
68:45
when he's taking something that's good
68:47
that's from god
68:48
and he hates god so in any way he can
68:51
make something look bad he never makes
68:54
anything look good except sinning
68:57
so a lot of the things that he says that
68:59
everybody thinks now halloween
69:01
that belongs to satan that's right don't
69:04
celebrate it
69:07
for the same reason i would tell you to
69:10
you know get on heaven's side
69:12
look up all right uh all those
69:15
evil practices they show in in the
69:18
halloween it is satan's highest day
69:20
of the year and he wants people to
69:23
celebrate his images
69:25
and and it also brings fear into people
69:28
especially
69:28
children and you do draw things to you
69:32
so you don't want to wear any kind of
69:34
image that belongs to the enemy and i
69:35
don't mind if you don't want me to say
69:37
that anymore you don't want to hear me
69:38
anymore don't listen to it
69:39
but i'm telling you truth because i'm a
69:41
seer and i see the things that follow
69:42
those kids down the street
69:44
when they're wearing like ghoulish
69:45
things or demonic things
69:47
you're saying come on yes because you're
69:50
wearing your image
69:53
that's right amen
69:56
so everybody's listening everybody here
69:59
do not celebrate that day
70:01
and one day we will our company have a
70:04
festival of
70:05
light on that same day and we will
70:08
celebrate heaven on that day
70:11
and we'll celebrate life and joy and
70:13
happiness and goodness
70:15
and uh we are going to make calendars
70:17
and on october 31st
70:19
on that calendar it will say celebrate
70:21
life
70:23
we will not honor even mention the other
70:26
side
70:27
amen and i know my dad will tell us all
70:30
the time don't go out and do that
70:31
well my mom would let us because she was
70:33
never churched or anything and
70:34
my dad would pray and pray and pray that
70:36
we would never be affected by it
70:37
he just had a connection to heaven and
70:39
eventually i saw it
70:41
being you see i'm like okay i could tell
70:43
you dad what i saw
70:45
and after that we wouldn't we wouldn't
70:46
do it anymore we would give stuff out we
70:49
didn't shut our door and shut people out
70:51
we would give them a track with a piece
70:53
of candy when they came to the door
70:55
okay we'd have it wrapped around or is a
70:57
part of it we would give it to them
70:58
they're not gonna throw it away okay
71:00
they'll take it home drive it home take
71:01
it out of their bag
71:02
and it'll be put somewhere but somebody
71:04
might see it
71:10
so we do bless people we bless people we
71:12
know a lot of them don't have a clue
71:14
about that but uh you know i'm always
71:16
going to tell you the truth amen
71:20
celebrate christmas yes give people
71:23
gifts that have helped you throughout
71:25
your life and
71:26

71:28
could be something simple you know i
71:30
don't know the guy in the toll booth
71:31
who has you know has to take your money
71:33
all day long and go over the bridge we
71:35
don't have those anymore in our city
71:36
thank you god
71:40
there was one person who ran for mayor
71:42
nobody ever remembers anything about him
71:44
but one thing
71:45
he got rid of the toe booth
71:49
that was his election promise and he
71:51
actually kept it none of the rest of
71:52
them
71:54
so we remember him so i just want you to
71:57
stay excited about this time and
71:59
uh i have a few more minutes we're going
72:02
to stop and take up an offering
72:03

72:05
them give so we're going to go ahead and
72:06
take up the offering
72:08
and uh to be a partner with us and what
72:11
we do
72:12
and i tell people what you're doing is
72:13
you're helping to reveal heaven on this
72:15
earth
72:16
when you help uh partner with us and you
72:18
give to us
72:19
and you're blessing heaven at the same
72:20
time because this is heaven's plan
72:23
i did not sit in my room one day and
72:26
come up with all this
72:28
that was not on my list
72:31
my list was i will be in big business
72:33
one day
72:34
and i will have a nice loft apartment
72:36
somewhere and it will only be me
72:38
father son and holy spirit with a
72:40
wonderful life
72:42
that was my plan i only got one part of
72:46
that plan
72:47
father son and holy spirit with me for
72:49
the rest of my life
72:52
[Laughter]
72:54
they had their own plan and i was push
72:57
whacked
72:58
[Laughter]
73:02
so and the other thing i'm gonna ask
73:04
also is anybody who's watching this
73:07
if you have not given to river rock
73:10
church
73:11
i would not be here sharing these words
73:14
if he had not invited me
73:15
that's right so even if he's met his
73:17
expenses i would like for you to go to
73:19
his site
73:20
and give money to them they have a big
73:23
project ahead of them
73:24
they're going to help people with are
73:25
you kidding is what my dad and all of us
73:28
kids did for most of our lives we took
73:31
food to people
73:32
we took supplies to people we helped
73:34
them move into homes we painted seniors
73:36
homes
73:37
we we have a heart to help
73:41
so that's what i see with all this yeah
73:43
and they didn't ask for it okay this is
73:46
the thing
73:46
they did not ask for this this was god's
73:50
plan
73:51
if you've given yourself to god expect
73:53
the unexpected amen
73:55
this is the unexpected but that is not
73:57
normal
73:59
for major companies to call you up and
74:00
say i have traffic trainer loads
74:02
of stuff to give to you do you want it
74:07
i know people who beat dom the doors of
74:09
those places say can you give some stuff
74:11
to us to help with our project
74:13
they didn't even say that they don't
74:14
even have a place to put it and yet here
74:16
it is
74:17
and it's coming and it's not going to
74:19
stop
74:21
so they need a warehouse and not some
74:23
cheap one
74:24
that they have to spend half a million
74:25
dollars fixing i want them to have a
74:28
wonderful one amen amen so please
74:31
give if you have not given and you're
74:33
watching this
74:34
you need to send some money to pastor
74:36
eric at river rock church
74:37
for this project amen
74:41
and then you have a part of that reward
74:43
no matter where it happens this is how
74:45
god does
74:47
he will give you reward like eric will
74:49
get
74:50
because you're helping him to do this he
74:54
didn't ask me to do this
74:56
god told me to do it he said you're
74:58
going to bless
74:59
my son eric you're going to bless
75:01
riverrot who's invited you time and time
75:03
again no matter how wild you
75:05
are or the things that you say he obeys
75:08
you obey
75:09
i want to help him this is my plan it's
75:11
his plan eric so you're not going to
75:12
escape
75:12
it so people please remember them
75:15
but right now we're going to take up an
75:17
offering uh for me to help me in what i
75:19
do we have a lot of big plans
75:22
weather warriors is gonna be one of them
75:24
he's not gonna let us drop that
75:26
and uh our whole women's thing we have
75:28
will go worldwide
75:30
the wonder women and now we're adding on
75:32
top of that
75:33
something for all the men called the
75:35
dread champions because hell will drive
75:37
you
75:39
if anybody does anything it should be
75:41
held dreading you amen
75:43
you wake up in the morning they start
75:45
getting terrified
75:47
and so we have a lot of things we have
75:49
our wonder woman event coming up
75:51
we have our champions event coming up
75:53
and next year we'll also add to that our
75:55
host initiative
75:56
event and our spirit realm boot camp
76:00
which every member of the body of christ
76:02
needs that so they know what the spirit
76:04
realm is what happens there what
76:06
authority do you have there how do you
76:07
use that authority
76:09
why is it necessary to know about in
76:10
your life because the veil
76:12
between the spirit realm and the natural
76:14
realm is getting
76:15
thinner we we really hope to see an
76:20
angel one day
76:21
one day they'll be everywhere and you
76:22
will see them
76:24
but there will be both sides and the
76:27
other side will try to influence people
76:29
too
76:30
and you'll see them so why not know this
76:33
is going to happen on this earth
76:36
it's going to happen and so you're
76:39
hearing this
76:40
it's going to happen you will see angels
76:42
you'll see them in your home living in
76:43
your hands
76:44
home going back to heaven and forth in
76:45
your home
76:47
they may have some come to the front
76:48
door and knock
76:51
and the other side will be happening
76:53
they'll be trying to make friends with
76:54
people
76:55
and trying to prove that they're good
76:56
too i'm talking about demons
76:58
because so many of the kids games and
77:01
videos
77:02
and movies are actually helping to
77:04
introduce them
77:05
as something that is normal
77:09
and so you have to have a voice that
77:11
tells you this is going to happen
77:13
it's important to know about this and
77:14
people change when they have spirit
77:16
around boot camp
77:17
and they understand that's not just a
77:19
mysterious unseen realm that is a real
77:21
literal round
77:23
where things travel in it there's
77:24
highways in it there's places in it
77:27
there's things that you need to know
77:28
about that's where your real authority
77:30
is
77:31
when you speak and take authority your
77:32
king or uh your king a priest or a lord
77:36
in the spiritual level of authority so
77:39
you have to know what that spiritual
77:40
what that spirit realm is amen
77:43
so make up checks to river rock church
77:46
and then they'll just give me one check
77:48

i would sing and they would cry
79:52
and they would repent and they would
79:54

they were about 11 or 12.
80:01
they wanted to make them laugh too
80:04

80:54

80:57
two or is it one one two
81:01
and i looked up and everyone in the
81:02
mirror was watching me
81:05
and and i was like down front somewhere
81:09
with my sister who dragged me in there
81:10
not down
81:11
john didn't drag me there and the
81:13
instructor stopped saying okay you back
81:15
there
81:15
you yeah you you
81:19
are going to go to the back of the room
81:20
in the corner
81:23
because you can't keep up and everyone
81:25
is trying to do except now they're
81:27
watching you so would you go back there
81:28
please
81:30
that didn't hurt my feelings
81:33
i told my sister this is not going to
81:35
work so i'm in the in the back in the
81:37
corner i'm still
81:38
doing the same thing you know is this
81:39
one two
81:41
one one two because i have not
81:44
gifted in that either and again the
81:47
music was rocking and people were doing
81:48
nothing
81:49
because then they were trying to look
81:50
behind everybody
81:53
in the mirror to see what i was doing so
81:56
i was asked to leave
82:00
and i was like yes amen i believe
82:08
now that was pretty much the same thing
82:09
that happened to me in eighth grade when
82:10
i tried out for chorus
82:13
i wasn't always bold you know i would go
82:16
for it anyway
82:17
and they so they had the auditions you
82:19
know how that happens
82:20
they let anybody anybody who wants you
82:22
to be in the course just come audition
82:24
so we know where to place you
82:27
and i went and they were singing that
82:28
dough ready me thing
82:31
and i'm halfway through and the people
82:33
are laughing so hard they're crying
82:37
i'm saying the director was crying the
82:39
people there to audition were crying
82:41
and go stop this is the joke isn't
82:44
it and what yes it is
82:55
that was not written on my scroll
82:59
but by speaking wildly and boldly about
83:02
what god wants regardless of what people
83:04
think about you to not
83:06
care when people bash me or whatever
83:08
they try to do
83:09
um i don't know they make yourself a
83:11
target on uh facebook or
83:13
youtube or twitter and whatever that new
83:16
thing is we're gonna be doing
83:18
instagram instagram
83:21
and we're already doing podcasts we're
83:22
going to be doing webinars
83:24
guys it'll put you out a lot more online
83:26
and i just ignore
83:27
everybody out there i do not have time
83:30
to stop
83:31
and justify myself and uh i don't have
83:34
time it's wasting time
83:35
i just start with you know i love you
83:37
but you're banned
83:38
[Laughter]
83:41
we got a lot of banding done during the
83:43
election i mean like a lot of people
83:48
those three nights when god said i'm
83:50
going to tell you all the
83:51
characteristics and the qualities of
83:53
this person i have chosen for president
83:55
and everybody was trying to guess who
83:56
that was and
83:58
and our viewing audience went from like
84:00
it went from like you know
84:01
20 30 000 to 200 000 overnight
84:05
and then 800 000
84:08
because and so on that fourth day when i
84:12
had when god revealed who it was i have
84:14
not chosen
84:15
a pastor for your president i have not
84:17
chosen an apostle
84:19
or i mean i went through the whole five
84:20
whole thing i haven't chosen any of
84:22
those because you don't need them i have
84:23
chosen a businessman
84:25
and this name is donald j and it was
84:28
like
84:29
bash back
84:32
like we were up all night long you know
84:34
trying to get all the bachelors off of
84:36
here
84:37
and i think that what really very quite
84:39
really a whole lot was a very small
84:40
percentage but the rest of them were
84:42
celebrating celebrating celebrating
84:45
and then they went to the voting booth
84:47
and they voted
84:48
amen so it was worth it and this is god
84:52
saying this to me this is the father he
84:54
said i'm gonna throw you so far out
84:55
there you are never coming back i'm
84:58
putting you on a political platform a
84:59
lot of people aren't going to like what
85:00
you say
85:01
but i like it so i'm just letting you
85:04
know
85:04
your life is going to be over completely
85:06
because i'm following you out there and
85:08
i'm not bringing you back off that
85:09
political platform
85:10
and trump's winning and i don't care
85:12
what anyone says because i'm voting this
85:14
time
85:15
and i'm turning that map red so whether
85:18
they like it or not this is going to
85:19
happen and you're going to let them all
85:21

85:24
and i said amen
85:27

85:31
you you are you know you're risking your
85:32
entire reputation
85:35
now i thought we weren't supposed to
85:36

85:46
even have an opinion
85:47

86:12
president and he will
86:14
seriously consider that he's a very
86:17

86:47
moderate there will be a moderate person

87:20
we didn't live in
87:21
amen and i'm 66 i'm still young god
87:25
calls me a baby
87:28
you know uh america is a baby he says
87:30
america is a baby amen
87:32
yes we're only a couple hundred years
87:34
old yes when you put us up to england
87:36
and these other countries and see how
87:37
long they've been around
87:39
that israel you know china how long have
87:41
they been here
87:43
we are a baby and saint wants to destroy
87:47
the baby
87:49
he's always afraid of the baby he always
87:52
has been
87:53
well we're a baby but we're going to
87:56
grow up amen
87:58
we're going up strong and happy
88:02
and filled with god and uh there'll
88:04
still be things arise in our country but
88:06
they'll be dealt with swiftly
88:08
there will be no anarchy in the streets
88:10
in our country
88:12
that we know is trying to overthrow each
88:14
other in our country
88:16
which has always been one of the devil's
88:17
plans and he doesn't know what he's
88:18
messing with and this is what god said
88:20
when they kept trying to say there's
88:22
going to be you know anarchy in the
88:23
streets and
88:24
then the international guard will be
88:26
called and take control of everything
88:28
and there's half a million body bags
88:30
waiting in
88:30
uh in missouri for the bodies what
88:33
happened from all this war in the
88:34
streets and
88:36
god's like laughing in heaven he said
88:39
that's not my plan and that is not going
88:41
to happen
88:42
he said besides the fact that they don't
88:44
understand that they aren't ever going
88:46
to get their weapons
88:48
god said they won't ever get their guns
88:50
in america
88:51
there's too many
88:55
he rednecks that there's too many
88:57
rednecks in america they all got guns
88:59
they're not giving any of them up but
89:01
they will use them
89:03
so they can forget about getting their
89:04
guns because it is our right to protect
89:06
ourselves
89:07
in other countries that are like third
89:09
world countries that happened because
89:10
they took away the right to bear arms
89:13
they have no voice in their country they
89:16
have no way to protect themselves in
89:17
their country
89:18
that's why they're crushed down and god
89:21
said leaders who are presidents can be
89:23
great
89:24
leaders in the way if they want good for
89:26
their country and if they want to do
89:27
what is right for the country then their
89:28
country can be great
89:30
he said but dictators if you're a
89:33
dictator
89:34
then you hate what is right most of the
89:37
time
89:38
you only want what you want it has to be
89:41
only your way
89:42
and you crush if you don't get your way
89:46
you take away all the rights of the
89:47
people that way they can be controlled
89:49
they can only operate oh it sounds like
89:51
the market of east
89:52
and then they can only operate the way
89:54
you allow them to operate he said but
89:56
america is not that country
89:58
amen and i will pray for all of us stand
90:01
up and pray for those other countries
90:03
right now
90:04
that are going through shifts in their
90:06
government that they will hear god and
90:09
they will do what is right amen
90:10
amen
90:17
so we say we can all repeat this god
90:23
our father jesus christ
90:27
our king our king holy spirit
90:30
our best friend we stand in the gap
90:35
for all those countries that don't have
90:38
justice liberty or freedom
90:43
we pray on their behalf that you will
90:46
help them
90:48
open the eyes of their leaders
90:51
to see what is right and to go after
90:54
what is right
90:56
we pray those people be loved and cared
91:00
for they will have no more wars
91:04
or poverty or disease
91:08
in their countries we pray that you will
91:11
bless them
91:14

01:04
much cake you're eating
01:05
[Laughter]
01:06
we will be addressing that before we're
01:10
done tonight you now this is going to be
01:11
a short broadcast number one
01:14
my husband's waiting to eat and i've
01:16
learned from men
01:18
if the world's falling apart which it's
01:19
not if they're at war in a bunker
01:22
where the missile is flying past them
01:24
that probably doesn't happen that way
01:26
however i will tell you this men have to
01:29
eat
01:30
all you women who are married say amen
01:35
because i have been married for 43 years
01:37
and this is not about my marriage but
01:39
why not bring it into play
01:41
i have learned how to get along with my
01:43
husband and love him
01:45
not want to run him out of town on a
01:46
rail some of you if you're in your 10th
01:49
12th year of marriage you may feel that
01:51
way please hang in there
01:52
okay god brought you that man and you
01:55
know what
01:57
i will address this another guy
02:01
the holy spirit said continue on with
02:03
what you have to say
02:05
and they have asked me to talk about
02:08
god's reality which is
02:09
actually the thing we should want to
02:11
know the most and
02:13
actually his reality is the truth
02:16
a lot of fake news going on everybody
02:18
you've known that for
02:19
months probably years but right now with
02:23
the stuff going on right now in
02:24
washington dc and everything else
02:26
there's a lot of stuff
02:29
being flown out there for you to listen
02:31
to or you to watch
02:33
i hope you find some truth in some of it
02:36
some of it's like so far out there
02:38
is from outer space some of us just on
02:41
wi-fi space
02:43
some of it i'm not quite sure where it's
02:45
from i just know one thing
02:47
i listen to god i hear him well
02:50
i have known him for some time now
02:54
which is his decision to put me
02:57
out there i was always the person that
02:59
wanted to hide because
03:01
i didn't need anybody uh personally
03:04
i had a try therefore i had all the
03:06
validation
03:08
or war that i wanted so right now i can
03:12
persevere and continue on
03:14
i forgive everyone out there please do
03:17
not waste your time trying to explain to
03:19
people who don't want to hear an
03:20
explanation
03:22
or who don't want the truth just pray
03:24
for them and ignore them
03:26
like they said nothing whatsoever
03:27
because that's actually the best thing
03:28
you can do
03:30
and i know because more people are
03:32
watching and listening
03:33
you're always going to get more of the
03:35
side that is
03:37
clueless who hates everybody
03:40
who has their own mindset and doesn't
03:41
want anyone else's
03:44
who are just angry and they want to vent
03:46
on everybody
03:47
right now i happen to be a bull's-eye
03:50
but i'm also a bull's-eye for god
03:53
that part i love so i forgive everybody
03:56
in advance
03:57
god act like they never said it
03:59
especially if it was one of your
04:00
prophets
04:01
jumping off the path off the train or
04:04
out into nowhere
04:06
please forgive them and help them to
04:08
know the truth so they can be free
04:11
they can be powerful for you and not
04:14
a voice for the enemy because right now
04:16
the reality god's reality is
04:18
this is not a doom and gloom time
04:22
this is not a time to be in fear
04:25
to tolerate fear or participate with
04:28
fear it's a time to be great with god
04:32
excited about his plans and please
04:35
pursue
04:36
making plans for your life like you were
04:38
before all this ever happened
04:41
because it will be like it never
04:42
happened and that is god's reality
04:45
he has a moment in time to shift us
04:49
and accelerate us forward but before he
04:51
does that
04:53
he will cleanse the platform expose the
04:57
darkness and boy
04:58
is there a lot of that to expose
05:01
and it doesn't matter what group it's
05:03
being disposed from it will be exposed
05:05
in this time
05:06
and god will also deal with it in this
05:08
time why
05:10
because of all the powerful things he
05:12
has planned for us
05:14
i have been there i have seen it
05:17
it is going to be great your children's
05:20
future is so fantastic
05:22
it will not be filled with fear it will
05:24
not be filled with evil it will not be
05:27
filled with having to run and escape
05:29
somewhere hide under your school desk
05:31
you know that's not what's happening
05:33
right now it's god
05:35
asking us to trust him until his
05:39
time comes to show it all
05:43
and trust me you wonder what time is
05:45
going to happen you will see it
05:47
you'll see the exposure you'll see the
05:49
arrest
05:50
you'll see the fraud he will not let
05:52
anyone escape
05:54
with justice not being brought to them
05:57
justice will be served that's what he
05:59
says so wait for the justice people is
06:02
so worth it
06:04
to love your family spend time with them
06:07
go on as normal as you possibly can
06:10
until it's wiped out disposed of
06:13
put away wiped off and god will set in
06:16
place the ones
06:17
he trusts to speak to you now we have
06:20
several things we want to talk about in
06:22
this broadcast so i'll just give you a
06:23
little
06:24
what is it called an outline an index
06:26
whatever you want to call it
06:28
okay we will discuss the reality of what
06:30
god is doing right now
06:32
we will discuss the earthquakes
06:35
that started the shaking that god said
06:38
on november the
06:39
4th of 2020
06:42
when the ground begins to shake
06:45
wait for the great exposure of fraud
06:48
to begin to happen and when it's done
06:52
it will all be dealt with it will all be
06:55
brought to justice
06:57
i don't need to name any names to let
06:58
you know that this is what he's doing
07:01
so on november the 4th things started
07:04
shaking
07:05
and guess what even up to right now they
07:08
are still shaking
07:09
not just here in america all over the
07:11
world
07:12
some of them cannot even be explained
07:14
why because
07:15
sometimes in the spirit realm what
07:17
they're doing is so
07:19
powerful there's always a little bit of
07:21
that that laps over into this natural
07:24
realm
07:24
and people can feel it sometimes they
07:27
can hear it
07:28
and let me tell you that shaking and the
07:31
winds being released
07:32
that is god moving on this earth
07:36
yes i mean the father moving on the
07:39
earth
07:40
you remember what happened the first
07:41
time he did that the mountains caught on
07:43
fire
07:44
well he wants your souls to catch on
07:47
fire for
07:47
him not in fear
07:51
not thinking you needed to be rescued
07:54
this is god's reality now we've jumped
07:56
to that subject
07:57
god has a reality and his reality is
08:00
this is a powerful exciting time to be
08:03
alive
08:04
he has never changed that some people
08:06
have changed it
08:07
some people are jumping off that train
08:10
right now
08:10
thinking that we're going to be derailed
08:12
and there'll be a crash
08:14
i think the future will take a crash
08:17
because you cannot speak for god
08:18
saying adamantly this is what he has
08:20
said and this is what he's going to do
08:22
and just
08:23
because you don't know the time
08:26
you think it's not gonna happen that is
08:29
an immaturity
08:30
in the prophets of god you need to know
08:34
if he says something to you or showed
08:35
you and said this will happen
08:38
just because it's not a year window of
08:40
time
08:41
or man's window of time it doesn't mean
08:44
it won't happen
08:46
you can't back up you can't stop going
08:50
forward
08:51
the true prophets of god right now are
08:53
speaking
08:54
greatness the power of god the joy of
08:57
the lord
08:58
celebration celebration celebration
09:01
is coming to america that's what his
09:03
true prophets are saying
09:05
if you hear them saying there's doom and
09:06
gloom let's go
09:08
we're going into the deep darkness guess
09:11
who they're listening to
09:13
not god the enemy has a voice too
09:16
and when you accept fear he'll make sure
09:20
satan well make sure you hear his voice
09:23
and then you'll believe it
09:24
and then you run after it and then you
09:26
repeat it does this sound like a cycle
09:29
i can tell you right now god wants you
09:32
to believe
09:32
him and trust him satan
09:36
does not hold your life in his hand that
09:39
doesn't happen to the very end
09:41
and you most likely won't be here unless
09:43
you're several hundred years old
09:45
you are in the greatest days god
09:47
designed to be on the earth
09:50
he's just setting it up i'm sorry it
09:53
didn't happen on the third i'm sorry it
09:55
didn't happen
09:56
so far in january that doesn't mean he's
09:58
not doing it
09:59
no because i do have something
10:03
a lot don't i has a seer anointing
10:08
if you were a prophet and you could see
10:10
into the spirit
10:11
you would right now see demons quaking
10:14
in fear sliming their way
10:18
to get out of the way because
10:21
they know and they can see god
10:25
is walking across this nation
10:28
they're terrified now because they know
10:30
their plans are going up in smoke
10:32
literally they're running away as fast
10:35
as they can so they don't get
10:37
burnt by the fire of god and let me tell
10:40
you
10:40
your prayers are so powerful when you
10:42
stand with god and you make declarations
10:45
it begins to release something in the
10:47
spirit realm that does
10:48
cause fear and the camp of the enemy
10:52
the enemy is not man the
10:55
enemy is satan he just uses man
10:58
he uses him for his own purposes to
11:00
speak his words
11:01
to say what his plans are his plans are
11:04
never good
11:06
and they don't bring hope or joy to
11:08
anybody
11:10
so don't listen to anyone
11:13
who's speaking in doom and gloom
11:17
and hate and cowering
11:21
and having to put up with a horrible
11:23
future
11:25
maybe they want that future i don't
11:29
the moral majority in this country don't
11:31
want that future
11:32
the true body of christ who are all
11:35
knowing that god is going to move his
11:38
hand
11:39
when he is ready whether it is
11:44
tomorrow or not
11:47
you may hold your finger out and say
11:48
you're fake news
11:51
you're a fake leader we don't receive
11:53
you
11:54
we don't celebrate what you've said
11:56
because fraud has been committed
11:58
not sure that facebook will let me keep
12:00
this one up make sure you're taping it
12:03
make sure you make a copy of it and keep
12:04
it all right
12:06
and i'm telling you anything you want to
12:08
keep that's been said and spoken
12:10
or written make a paper copy
12:14
go find your printer if you didn't
12:16
forget what that was
12:17
print it so you may hold it in the time
12:21
i had
12:22
should you for a few weeks need to do
12:24
that
12:25
if not i hope you're taking notes
12:27
because i will tell you this
12:29
everything god has spoken that god
12:32
himself has spoken
12:33
it will happen and it will be great
12:38
and there will be celebration in the
12:40
streets
12:41
so the reality of god is make your stand
12:46
and don't be moved and while you're
12:48
waiting
12:49
celebrate why does god say celebrate
12:52
that
12:52
shows the enemy and your friends
12:56
that you're standing in faith your faith
12:58
isn't going to be stolen from you
13:00
it will be accelerated and guess what
13:02
all your friends and family that made
13:03
fun of you
13:04
will remember the words you said to them
13:07
and when
13:08
what god's going to do happens they will
13:11
be running
13:12
to you for answers that is the reality
13:15
of right now this whole week
13:18

amen amen there you go you said it with
14:18
your own mouth
14:19

14:21
are powerful teach your children to
14:23
celebrate
14:24
what jesus christ did for them and what
14:26
his plans are
14:27
for right now on this earth this is not
14:31
a joke
14:32
this is not a recording i'm live see
14:35
here i'll pinch myself
14:37
this is a real life this is god's
14:39
reality
14:41
all the rest of it is a smoke screen by
14:44
satan
14:45
wanting to try to convince us that we're
14:47
going down
14:48
life is going down the country's going
14:50
down
14:51
that's awfully funny i remember the last
14:54
time
14:55
god showed up when satan thought he won
14:59
he got burnt i can expect
15:02
to see the same i've seen demons
15:05
slinking
15:06
away from everything running from dc
15:10
as fast as they can you know what that
15:12
means
15:13
if the enemy's power is left great
15:16
confusion will begin to fall on the
15:17
others
15:19
get ready for a real show that's all i
15:22
can say
15:24
remember whose life
15:27
you are in their hands right
15:31
that life is yours the decision is yours
15:34
the word should be yours that you agree
15:37
with life and not death
15:40
god says to choose life and to speak
15:42
life whatever is a good report sir
15:45
remind you of the word those words you
15:47
declare
15:48
so if you hear things that aren't a good
15:50
report we know where that came from
15:52
no matter who is saying them pray for
15:54
those people
15:56
do not bash those people man if they
15:58
ever needed help it would be right now
16:00
i don't care how major a prophet it is
16:03
who all of a sudden
16:04
overnight has decided the bad stuff is
16:07
going to happen
16:08
because guess what they're looking with
16:10
their natural eyes and when god says
16:13
they begin to do that this is what they
16:15
see they can see
16:17
as far as their hand and that's it
16:20
but when you stay focused on god keep
16:22
your eyes on him
16:24
stay excited don't step back on the word
16:28
and you will be accelerated
16:32
and you will be prospered and you will
16:34
be blessed and you will have the
16:35
greatest
16:36
memories that you can tell your children
16:39
and your grandchildren you will not
16:41
believe what happened
16:43
in this beginning of this divine decade
16:45
boy
16:46
we had to make a stand so remember to
16:49
celebrate and i will show you the cake
16:50
in just a minute jen is waving me down
16:53
keep us on track jen whatever whatever
16:56
are we supposed to talk about
16:58
um well you wanted to mention the
17:02
earthquakes yes november the 4th was
17:05
when god
17:06
actually began to talk about what would
17:07
happen and i can go back on the elijah
17:10
list
17:11
and re-share the november 4th
17:15
uh facebook live with you and steve yeah
17:17
so everyone can hear when you said that
17:19
oh yeah that actual uh broadcast was so
17:22
powerful
17:22
and really neither one of us probably
17:24
knew what god would say
17:26
he just knew he wanted to speak after
17:28
november the 3rd which of course we know
17:30
was election day
17:32
god knew exactly what would happen so it
17:34
is very powerful that god
17:36
since november the 4th what he said
17:39
would happen
17:40
has been happening you just haven't seen
17:43
and heard it but trust me
17:44
you will but on november the 4th that
17:47
day
17:48
when he said when the ground begins to
17:50
shake
17:51
look for the beginning of the landslide
17:54
a fraud
17:55
what happened on november the 4th john
17:57
well there was
17:58
a earthquake in yosemite valley
18:02
california there you go that's the usa
18:05
and um the thing that we thought was
18:07
also
18:08
amazing was the day of the
18:11
election yes because remember they they
18:14
they stopped counting
18:16

18:18
something like that and then there was
18:20
a earthquake around 2 58 i'm trying to
18:23
remember where it was
18:24
in the morning yeah in the morning that
18:26
would have been eight pm
18:28

18:30
when stuff was going

19:22
earthquakes there's been mysteriously
19:25
mysterious ground shakings everywhere
19:28
that's
19:28
not reported that's right they don't
19:30
know where it's come from
19:32
and also there's been activities a host
19:34
of heaven people
19:35
unusual gust of winds that have come out
19:38
of nowhere
19:39
yes that were not natural right they
19:42
weren't like a natural wind
19:44
i'm telling you god why would god say
19:47
that about the shaking
19:48
it's to encourage you and let you know
19:52
he is doing things that you cannot see
19:55
right now
19:56
but everything that is seen this is what
19:59
the word says everything this scene was
20:01
made by that which was
20:02
unseen the unseen is the spirit realm it
20:05
is a father son
20:06
and holy spirit's activities and there
20:09
is a lot of that going on
20:10
they are driving things out moving
20:14
things into position
20:15
that they will need their place there
20:17
for what is going to happen
20:19
this week will be key i'm not saying
20:22
tomorrow
20:23
i'm not promising anything tomorrow
20:25
except god won't stop moving and doing
20:27
things
20:28
until all of this is shown and you will
20:31
see
20:31
it with your natural eyes and hear it
20:34
with your ears
20:35
and then there'll be the great
20:36
celebration your job
20:39
is to stay in faith stand and stand
20:42
therefore but don't stand
20:43
looking sorry and sad and fearful
20:46
remember please to pray for all those
20:48
who are
20:49
backing up apologizing for things they
20:52
said there's nothing to apologize for
20:54
people
20:55
the truth will be made known and no one
20:59
will escape
21:00
knowing about it no one will escape
21:02
being uncovered that did it
21:05
so pray for those who've jumped off the
21:08
train
21:09
and backed up and god pray
21:12
that they be reached that they know the
21:14
truth and tell the truth
21:16
to not get people to fear don't let
21:19
people put fear in you
21:21
then the enemy has something in you he
21:23
can use
21:24
it won't stop god from what he's going
21:26
to do but why not enjoy
21:29
every day of your life let god says you
21:31
choose to be happy
21:32
if no one else does heaven is happy
21:36
heaven is excited we thought we would
21:38
drink bring these up because we've had a
21:40
lot of questions
21:42
the last broadcast we did has already
21:44
reached a hundred and forty two thousand
21:46
people what
21:47
they want to hear somebody who's hearing
21:50
god
21:50
and gives them hope god always brings
21:54
hope
21:55
so are you saying that even if
21:58
a certain someone is sworn in on the
22:01
20th yes
22:02
i think and we all wake up on the 21st
22:06
yes and he still thinks he's in that
22:09
position
22:10
it means we should still stand strong
22:12
stand strong and know this
22:14
until it's all revealed it
22:18
isn't over that's right
22:21
god has the final say and when he says
22:25
it and when it is all
22:27
done somebody will be moving back in the
22:30
white house
22:32
and guess what they know it too
22:36
there's no fear in the lives of those
22:39
who just moved out
22:40
they already know that they will be back
22:44
so just remember covert activities hey
22:47
guys
22:48
just be thankful god didn't ask us to
22:50
wait 120 years
22:52
like he did with noah he's just wanting
22:55
us to wait a little while
22:57
so keep holding on
23:00
it's gonna happen the rain is coming he
23:02
keeps telling me the rain is coming
23:04
the rain is the evidence but this time
23:07
it's the enemy's camp that's going to be
23:09
flooded
23:10
and destroyed that's right and we are
23:13
not for violence of any kind well
23:16
maybe spiritual violence did you know
23:18
there's a godly violence
23:20
a spiritual violence that you wore in
23:22
the spirit against satan against the
23:24
demonic armies
23:26
that is certainly okay we don't want to
23:29
have violence against people although
23:32
the group that says they don't want it
23:33
seem to be doing it
23:35
you already know what i'm talking about
23:36
right god didn't intend us to have to
23:39
put up or tolerate
23:41
violence not in this country not in our
23:44
lives
23:45
actually not for those who believe him
23:47
in this day
23:49
you won't have to die to show who god is
23:53
but you will have to live and live
23:57
powerfully and rule and reign with
23:59
christ
24:00
in this world right now and he
24:03
is not afraid was there anything else we
24:06
were going to talk about jenna
24:08
oh yes the holy spirit just reminded me
24:11
guess what i still have lights on
24:13
outside
24:14
if at all possible go put some lights
24:17
back
24:18
up maybe you haven't taken them down the
24:20
light
24:22
represents god so let's leave some light
24:25
up
24:26
until the real inauguration happens
24:29
maybe leave up the red lights
24:31
red and white lights very white would be
24:33
great
24:34
that would be great but if you only got
24:36
white we'll take that
24:38
we're leaving ours up i hope you leave
24:40
yours up i hope they're seeing
24:41
everywhere and people go blows up we
24:44
have hope for a future we are trusting
24:46
our god
24:48
our god is light
24:51
why not put something up outside or in
24:54
your window
24:55
that represents god
24:58
that's who our savior is that's someone
25:02

32:16
like to share
32:16
a couple of our events we've already got
32:18
planned for this year
32:20
you know i travel many different places
32:22
not just here
32:24
in the state of florida but all over
32:25
america in canada and even overseas i
32:29
actually will be in greece
32:30
this year i'll also be in the caribbean
32:33
many other places but we have our own
32:35
events
32:36
that one quest international that is my
32:39
company
32:40
and myself we sponsor those events
32:43
they're always held right here in our
32:45
city
32:46
and the first one we have during the
32:48
year that you actually can travel to and
32:50
be a part of
32:51
is called heaven's invitation
32:55
that is not us saying what we want to
32:57
say that is god
32:58
saying what he wants to say and angels
33:02
are always present in those meetings
33:04
we may have a host id workshop even to
33:07
help you identify them in the sky
33:10
let me tell you they've always been here
33:11
it's about time we recognize that heaven
33:13
has an army
33:14
and they are here to work with us that
33:17
is one of the things we always cover in
33:19
heaven's invitation
33:20
it is heaven inviting you to find out
33:24
about that glorious place filled with
33:25
splendor and wonder where god
33:27
lives where his throne is and so i look
33:30
forward to seeing you that will be june
33:32
25th
33:32
26th and 27th of this year
33:36
and i believe that we may or may not
33:39
have registration open yet i think that
33:41
may happen
33:42
sometime this month at least by the end
33:44
of the month you can all
33:45
register it is a free event we do not
33:49
charge you to come to that event but you
33:51
have to register so we have an idea of
33:53
how many people are coming
33:55
so as soon as that is open make sure you
33:57
get on go to revealingheaven.com
34:00
and sign up click on the events and sign
34:02
up for heaven's invitation
34:04
and then after heaven's invitation in
34:06
september
34:08
we have our men's event it is called the
34:11
dread
34:11
champions why do we call them that
34:14
because
34:14
hell will dread them and that is the
34:18
purpose for having that if you want to
34:20
know what a manifested son of god
34:22
looks like how they live well what
34:25
happened in the spirit realm when they
34:26
begin to rule in this earth
34:28
you need to come men and i think that's
34:31
from the younger teens
34:33
all the way up to any age of men to come
34:35
we have a powerful time
34:37
we have a couple of the speakers i
34:39

34:42

34:59
things to share but definitely want to
35:01

38:59
you're going to know this is going to be
39:00
something exciting or fun
39:01
or interesting and so if you're watching
39:05
[Music]
39:13
so anyway that was awesome wasn't it
39:16
anyway i love doing things where i can
39:19
connect with people
39:20
you know i come from a really big family
39:22
for those who don't know me at all
39:24
guess what what about the pink hair i am
39:27
going to answer that question we
39:28
recently had a question from somebody
39:31
why do you have the pink hair so there's
39:33
some people who've known why for like 15
39:35
years
39:36
right i've had this pink hair for a very
39:38
long time
39:40
it's because god asked me to have this
39:42
pink hair
39:43
why heaven is different it is fantastic
39:46
it is amazing
39:47
and i represent heaven wherever i go and
39:50
he wanted me to show it on the outside
39:52
so how about that heaven's exciting and
39:55
because he asked me to do it
39:56
i obeyed i think god would appreciate it
39:59
when we
40:00
listen we hear and we obey that is what
40:03
he loves so this is just
40:05
really obedience of course i was not a
40:07
pink care person
40:08
that would make it too easy for me but i
40:11
have gotten used to it
40:13
and i want to bless the heart of god and
40:15
so guess what yes
40:17
i get it done every four weeks god
40:19
didn't put this pink hair on my head
40:21
i actually have to pay for it so again
40:23
guardians own people thank you so much
40:25
for supporting me
40:27
we have many things planned for the
40:28
future it's going to be really exciting
40:30
around here
40:31
and a lot of action going on not just
40:34
here in our studio but around this
40:37
world don't take your eyes off of korea
40:40
god is still doing something with that
40:43
also hollywood i am involved now in
40:46
helping to create a spirit realm input
40:50
for the resurrection of jesus christ
40:51
movie and by the way i just need to give
40:54
a tip
40:54
it's not the one with mel gibson we
40:56
bless mel gibson
40:57
and pray for him continually he gave us
41:00
a passion was that not amazing
41:03
but this one is being done through a
41:04
different whole group
41:06
you go to the resurrection of jesus
41:08
christ
41:10
website you'll probably see me talking
41:13
on that website
41:14
and find out some more information
41:15
they'll be putting a lot more on there
41:17
we're working really hard i do sketches
41:19
of the spirit realm
41:20
of heaven of hell because i've been to
41:22
those places and then my prophetic
41:24
artist makes them
41:25
amazing and these are scenes and
41:29
images and beings that will actually be
41:31
in that movie
41:33
so god notified me that i would be
41:35
involved in this several years ago
41:37
so i was preparing myself all along to
41:39
be a part but it's absolutely amazing
41:42
that we will get to change the way
41:44
people think about jesus christ about
41:46
heaven about how
41:47
the reality of both of those places and
41:50
also
41:52
what really happened in the spirit realm
41:55
in the garden on the cross in hell on
41:58
the third day when christ
41:59
wasted the principalities and powers and
42:01
took the keys
42:03
of hell death and the grave you'll be
42:04
seeing on the big screen
42:06
in a few years it's it's a it's a big
42:09
project
42:09
but i'm going to enjoy being a part of
42:11
it we do a lot of on the on the go with
42:13
cat
42:13
you see a lot of those things happening
42:15
and i give you tips about what goes on
42:16
with the making of a movie
42:18
and so i'm looking forward to being a
42:20
part of that also
42:22
don't take your eyes off of london
42:26
especially concerning the royalty boy
42:28
there's stuff going on right now
42:30
isn't there we're gonna hear about that
42:32
from here too uh i'm sure that i have
42:34
we'll have a lot more to share later
42:36
but uh we love queen elizabeth we pray
42:38
for her we pray for that whole country
42:40
you know we
42:41
america was kind of birthed out of that
42:43
country i do know in the habitation of
42:46
god
42:46
coming to this earth that america and
42:49
england
42:50
will be doing things hand in hand for
42:53
that
42:53
move of god in this earth so don't take
42:55
your eyes off of there either
42:57
there's a lot of other things going on
42:59
in this world i know there's violence in
43:00
some areas there's disasters in some
43:03
areas
43:03
we're learning to take authority over
43:05
all that because as a believer that is
43:07
your right to rule and reign with christ
43:10
to have authority over the weather
43:12
because we're over it not under it
43:14
we also host weather warriors here we
43:17
host um
43:18
the the host initiative which is the
43:21
army of heaven working with us
43:23
we also of course i already mentioned
43:24
drug champions and wonder women we have
43:26
a lot going on god has put
43:28
on our plate and we're going to be doing
43:31
great with all those things
43:32
don't take your eyes off of trump now
43:35
that's hard to do
43:36
right because you know this broadcast
43:39
couldn't go by
43:40
without me mentioning trump who will win
43:43
in
43:43
2020 look forward to celebrating with
43:46
him i
43:46
already am i'm sure that i'll be at the
43:49
um
43:50
inaugural prayer breakfast in washington
43:53
dc
43:54
uh last time i actually got to pray for
43:57
not in person but i did pray for the
43:58
president for pence
44:00
and at that time it was awesome i will
44:03
be doing a capitol hill
44:05
broadcast sometime this year i'll let
44:07
you know in advance if you're
44:08
in washington dc at that time stop by
44:11
the capitol
44:12

44:15
you get those days
44:16
it's going to be amazing god will be
44:18
exposing darkness
44:20
but i'm telling you he chose trump and
44:22
he has not done with him yet
44:25
i look forward to all that god is going
44:27
to do through him through his
44:28
administration
44:30
and you know don't worry about the fake
44:32
news okay
44:33
don't worry about him on you are fake
44:36
news
44:36
okay you fake your fake news yes and
44:39
guess what even heaven goes about that
44:41
heaven's talking about all the stuff
44:43
going on on the earth it's not like
44:45
they're blinded from it they understand
44:47
what's going on
44:48
everybody's declaring and decreeing for
44:50
things on this earth
44:51
god cares about you he hasn't forgotten
44:54
about you no matter who you are
44:56
he loves you he sent his son to die for
44:58
you
44:59
and something new that god gave us
45:01
assignment on
45:02

47:03
the idea zone day oh download from the
47:06
idea zones that day
47:07

47:09
about what does that mean
47:11
there is an idea zone in heaven
47:15
literally over the streets of gold
47:17
there's this beautiful cloud that's got
47:19
all these like
47:20
thousands and thousands of pieces it
47:22
looks like little pieces of glitter
47:24
every one of those is a witty idea an
47:25
invention and god
47:27
sends waves of that idea zone down to
47:30
the earth and drops them into the mind
47:32
of man that's how we get all those
47:33
amazing ideas
47:35
and so we have that date put on the
47:38
calendar
47:38

48:24
decade

48:35
you will be amazed if you don't belong
48:37
to god if you receive jesus christ
48:39

48:42
thing you do in your life is to make
48:43

48:44
your name is written in the lamest book
48:45
of life because you won't like
48:47
the other option okay been the hell been
48:50
there seeing that nobody wants to go
48:52
there
48:53
but heaven itself is an amazing place
48:56
filled with fun with excitement
48:59
with adventure and let me tell you when
49:01
people go there to live
49:03

49:25

49:27
only they won't be normal either there's
49:29
not much that's normal about heaven
49:31
everything is given to you for free all
49:34
right
49:35
you breathe in the life of god all the
49:37
time
49:38
you travel on light you travel unsound
49:41
even your very worship you travel in
49:43
heaven
49:44
fantastic amazing places i think i'm
49:46
going to have to have a special segment
49:48
every now and then
49:49
that is nothing but about having people
49:51
really
49:52
want to know what is it like and i tell
49:55
people all the time
49:56
instead of a funeral home they need to
49:57
have party depots
50:00
and that's where you sent from here to
50:02
go live in heaven in your spiritual body
50:05
your physical body will be resting
50:07
that's what sleeps
50:09
because people say what about the dead
50:10
in christ when they rise that
50:12
is your body your body is sleeping but
50:15
your spirit man
50:17
is very much alive in heaven
50:22
eating the best food that ever existed
50:24

00:04
and
00:05
being so happy i hope you are
00:09
by the way i just want to start by
00:12
saying
00:13
i have talked to several my prophet
00:14
friends just to make sure they're
00:16
celebrating and guess what they
00:18
are they have an all jumped ship
00:23
hope you haven't jumped ship if you have
00:24
we'll throw you a life raft
00:27
anyway i had to of course come on i'm
00:30
gonna come on every other day
00:32
as long as we're still up i'll still be
00:34
speaking
00:35
and guess what i'm running forward with
00:38
my race
00:39
running forward with life with joy with
00:42
celebration
00:42
and with god in his plans and yes
00:46
according to the title of this post
00:50
the shaking has begun and i'm serious
00:53
about that
00:54
i'll tell you why i'm excited you should
00:55
go back and look at on the largest
00:57
streams
00:58
the broadcast we did on november the 4th
01:02
and what god himself had to say about
01:04
all of this
01:05
guess what he didn't give a date and i'm
01:08
not giving a date i actually never have
01:10
given a date
01:11
i let god choose his time because man
01:14
has their own time frame
01:16
some people can wait a few days some a
01:18
couple weeks but man i don't think
01:19
anybody can go past a month
01:22
except the ones who really know what god
01:24
said and i can tell you what god's doing
01:26
yes there is a line being drawn who will
01:29
believe him and stand with him
01:31
and who he can use and accelerate in
01:33
these powerful days ahead
01:35
and who will have to catch up so i hope
01:37
you're not on the ketchup side
01:40
that could mean several things i won't
01:42
go there however i do want to tell
01:45
everyone hello all you people who are
01:47
still standing with what god said i
01:49
celebrate you i congratulate you
01:54
you have blessed the heart of god that
01:56
you're not giving up your stand
01:58
we all know what the bible says when you
02:00
make a stand stand therefore
02:02
you also know what it says right when
02:04
you're going forward in the kingdom
02:05
don't stab back
02:09
or what you will not be fit
02:12
in shape or ready for the kingdom
02:16
so there you go that's god's words to
02:19
you
02:20
i hope you all who switched and jumped
02:22
to the side of darkness and that's all
02:24
there is is darkness and light right now
02:26
get out of there while you can and be
02:29
one of the ones who made a stand that
02:31
you can celebrate and run in the streets
02:32
and shout and yell
02:34
that's exactly what's going to happen
02:37
because
02:37
life will win god always says to choose
02:41
life stand with life participate with
02:43
life
02:44
not the other side you remember we
02:47
prayed for mark zuckerberg right so he
02:49
knows
02:50
he still has a chance to switch back and
02:53
do what he did when he started all this
02:55
he just he designed
02:57
and made a wonderful place for all of us
02:59
to come and fellowship together
03:01
get to see different pictures and videos
03:03
and laugh
03:04
and enjoy them and enjoy life and
03:07
something happened to him please be
03:09
praying for him okay
03:11
this is a great place to do social
03:13
networking
03:14
and that's why it was designed but you
03:17
can't
03:18
let them ban you because you want god or
03:20
you want what is right or you want life
03:23
and so in them who don't even know what
03:24
they're saying you don't realize what
03:26
you're saying
03:27
when you don't want to be on the other
03:29
side and not decide god has chosen
03:33
if you think he's run away and he's
03:34
hiding somewhere in heaven
03:36
that is not true
03:40
did you feel the groan shake yet because
03:43
you will
03:44
you remember on november 4th god himself
03:47
said
03:47
when the ground begins to shake get
03:50
ready for the landslide
03:54
to expose everything
03:57
and you know what god's plans are you've
03:59
heard me say it from the very beginning
04:02
from 2015 guess what he's not changed
04:05
his plan
04:07
what he is do is exposing all the
04:08
darkness he's going to clean that
04:10
platform off
04:12
no matter where they are what they're
04:13
saying what they're doing god's
04:14
preparing us for the next
04:16
20 years of greatness no you don't have
04:19
to get used to wearing masks for the
04:21
rest of your life you don't have to
04:22
social distance for the rest of your
04:24
life
04:25
god intends to actually take the virus
04:27
off the earth
04:28
maybe he'll put it with the other ones
04:29
who were running away i don't know
04:32
i just know this i know what god's plans
04:34
are he hasn't changed them
04:36
and unless he tells me differently i am
04:38
not changing my stand
04:40
i will be right here releasing justice
04:43
releasing the host of heaven and by the
04:46
way
04:47
yesterday released 50
04:51
billion of the host of heaven and if you
04:54
did not know this
04:55
god calls florida over the skies of
04:58
florida he calls it his
04:59
battle station on earth what does that
05:01
mean that means their billions of the
05:04
hosts posted there to be sent out on
05:06
assignment
05:07
and he had me send 50 billion yes
05:11
people he has a lot no one knows but him
05:15
you haven't counted them
05:17
you probably haven't even seen them
05:18
you'd probably be hiding if you had
05:20
the host of heaven are not beautiful
05:22
pretty boys with blonde hair
05:25
and harps they have weapons coming out
05:28
of them
05:29
the frequency of god the fire of god
05:31
they fight with lightning bolts
05:33
and guess what some of the ones who've
05:36
been assigned now
05:38
are the same ones who fought in the
05:39
flesh on behalf of israel go back and
05:41
read it in the bible
05:44
how one angel took up so many hundreds
05:47
of thousands that shocked them all
05:50
we have some of those fighting with us
05:54
i enjoy commanding the host of heaven
05:56
and they enjoy going on assignments
05:58
they need orders from headquarters and
06:00
let me tell you headquarters
06:02
in heaven is very excited about these
06:05
days
06:06
i know you've heard several times
06:08
different people sending things around
06:10
i'm sure some of it's conspiracy stuff
06:12
some of it's just being made up to make
06:14
you feel better some of it's actually
06:15
the real thing
06:17
you should decide on what you think it
06:18
is i just say this
06:20
get plenty of supplies including cake
06:23
and maybe for a couple weeks or so
06:25
just to save you a trip to the grocery
06:27
store this is not a time for death and
06:30
destruction for us
06:31
this is not a time for civil war in a
06:34
civil war you have to have a divided
06:35
nation
06:36
we have a pocket of people who'd rather
06:39
have communism
06:40
here i said it the rest of us almost 80
06:44
million of us that's the majority in
06:46
case you can't count
06:49
we want life liberty freedom justice and
06:51
righteousness in this nation
06:53
and we are going to get it
06:56
if god can save a world when eight
06:59
people
07:00
are praying how much do you think he can
07:03
do
07:04
with millions of people praying for this
07:07
nation for its destiny
07:09
and also the impact that will have
07:12
around this world there are millions and
07:15
millions of people
07:16
praying and agreeing with you what you
07:18
shouldn't do is begin to bash one
07:20
another
07:21
you're speaking the enemy's words
07:24
i'll bash evil all day long then i'm
07:27
gonna bash
07:28
the ones he made god sends people to
07:31
this earth they're already anointed
07:33
they're already appointed
07:35
i happen to be just one of those but i
07:38
will not lose my stand and i will
07:40
not back up
07:43
because these are powerful days if
07:46
people say what's going on their
07:47
powerful days
07:49
and when the hand of you god is about to
07:51
move for you yes you can sit and eat
07:53
cake and watch
07:54
you've prayed you've read your word
07:56
you've laid on your face you've cried
07:58
out to god guess what he heard you
08:01
he's not going to ignore your words when
08:03
they line up with his
08:05
when your words line up with his they
08:07
create something that no
08:10
man and no devil can stop
08:15
so this is what we have to say
08:18
go host make toast
08:22
i can tell you that they were released
08:24
50 billion the other day today
08:26
10 more billion god had me release
08:29
two key points in this country and key
08:32
points
08:32
around the world to be ready
08:36
what can they do they can expose things
08:39
they can speak to people and change the
08:42
way that they're thinking
08:44
they can say things of god to their
08:46
spirit just like the devil says to yours
08:49
if you're hearing it's all over let's
08:51
just give it up you're hearing the wrong
08:53
voice
08:55
the shaking has surely begun that god
08:57
spoke up on november the 4th
09:00
when he said when the ground begins to
09:03
shake get ready
09:06
for the great exposure the landslide of
09:09
exposure
09:10
that will happen he's not changing who
09:12
he has chosen
09:14
to keep in the white house and
09:17
it doesn't matter to me when god
09:19
finishes
09:21
what he's going to start
09:24
i am celebrating with him he took me
09:27
forward in time
09:28
again today and showed me people
09:32
running into the streets in america
09:34
laughing
09:35
they forgot if they didn't like someone
09:36
of another color nobody cared
09:38
they were so happy and joyful they were
09:41
grabbing they were hugging each other
09:43
without masks
09:44
people nobody cared
09:47
because freedom and liberty had come to
09:49
this country
09:50
and then he took me and showed me
09:52
different places around the world when
09:54
this landslide is done
09:59
they were running into the streets they
10:01
were grabbing one another laughing they
10:03
were dancing they were celebrating that
10:05
is your future
10:08
so don't give up don't step back
10:11
and don't take any fear
10:14
the only ones who should be afraid are
10:18
the ones who committed crime
10:20
i'll tell you who is afraid hell
10:23
i've seen demons quaking everywhere
10:26
they're terrified of what is about to
10:28
happen
10:30
they know what's going on they know the
10:32
hosts have been loosed
10:33
on this earth they know what they've
10:35
even been assigned to
10:37
they're running so why not sit down
10:41
get your popcorn and enjoy the show
10:45
because it's going to be great people
10:47
one day will make a movie of all this
10:50
and people will roar and laugh and clap
10:52
at the end
10:54
that's what you should be doing and jen
10:56
has a report to give
10:57
a very short report about what god said
11:00
on november the 4th when the
11:02
ground begins to shake get ready for the
11:06
landslide to happen so she's going to
11:08
come and share
11:09
with you all just a couple of
11:11
earthquakes that have taken place
11:14
uh over the over the last couple days
11:16
and especially the one that happened on
11:18
the fourth
11:19
there you go john come here
11:22
i'll just stand over here okay go ahead
11:24
and say it loud then
11:26
so um there were quite a lot
11:29
of things that happened especially on
11:31
the fourth i
11:32
pulled up an article and
11:35
i'm trying to find it yeah it's the
11:38
world earthquake report for monday
11:40
january 4th 2021
11:43
and it said that there were 10. 24th of
11:47
november
11:48
january 14th january the 4th okay yeah
11:51
and it says um
11:54
10 of the largest earthquakes in the
11:57
world happened
11:58
and it just lists all the different ones
12:00
and then the ones that were felt
12:02
were places like croatia
12:05
and um let's see there was a couple in
12:09
croatia there was one in south dakota
12:11
there was new zealand and puerto rico
12:15
and if you just go and just you can
12:18
literally see
12:19
every day from from
12:23
on this website including and then when
12:26
she was talking about
12:28
when she sent the host out um
12:32
yesterday how many did you send out 50
12:35
billion 50 billion
12:36
you'd hear that well it
12:39
it's crazy because i pulled up an
12:41
article this morning when i opened up
12:45
the internet and it the first thing it
12:46
said was south florida residents report
12:50
shaking no official reports of
12:52
earthquake
12:53
or explosions and it happened
12:56
in areas like ballard county
13:01
miami-dade monroe counties also
13:04
in um coral i think it's coral
13:07
coral springs and just various people
13:10
were reporting that their house started
13:12
shaking this dad was working with his
13:14
son
13:15
doing virtual school when their chairs
13:17
started to shake and then um
13:20
the rest of the family came running the
13:22
room asking what was that because he
13:24
thought am i imagining this they went
13:26
outside to see if it was like a big
13:28
truck there was no big truck
13:29
they've checked all the size
13:32
were seismographs the um
13:36
geographical whatever people that check
13:38
for for earthquakes they
13:40
there's no reports nothing none of the
13:42
graphs
13:43
moves none of the things and then they
13:45
said well maybe because there's a lot of
13:47
military that maybe they were
13:48
testing the jets because when they they
13:51
do the sonic boom
13:54
but they they so they contacted the
13:56
military bases in the area and they said
13:58
no we did all our jet testing on
14:00
thursday
14:01
nothing was done on friday so at the
14:03
very
14:04
end of the article it says the official
14:06
cause of the shaking and
14:08
rumbling is not yet known yeah because
14:11
you can't see the host leave
14:13
so but you can sure hear them
14:16
so i did share the article in the link
14:18
but um
14:19
there has been a tremendous amount of
14:22
activity
14:23
like i even uh googled earthquake
14:27
um january 12th there was a magnitude
14:30
2.9 earthquake in utah
14:32
um and then that does not mean god will
14:37
destroy with earthquakes that's letting
14:38
you know
14:39
something is happening yeah and if you
14:42
even do
14:42
earthquakes for today you just google
14:46
earthquakes for today it literally shows
14:48
you
14:49
a list of all of the ones that happened
14:51
today
14:52
uh do they have one here today um in the
14:55
u.s
14:56
um let's see i think it was indonesia
15:00
earthquakes today here we go uh
15:04
there was uh 5.5
15:07
in iran a 5.5 in afghanistan i
15:11
understand that completely
15:13
a 5.9 in guatemala a 4.0 in hawaii
15:19
and this one really when i told you this
15:22
one there was a 3.6
15:24
in conrad california which is smack in
15:26
the middle between
15:27
sacramento and san francisco wow and
15:30
what did you say about san francisco
15:32
yeah they just
15:33
put a notice out that they were banning
15:35
trump
15:36
from any kind of broadcast or saying
15:38
anything whatsoever from san francisco
15:41
in their area in their frequencies
15:42
and that's exactly where that earthquake
15:44
happened i think god is saying
15:46
he's not happy about that so this is
15:49
just a little heads up to encourage you
15:51
to let you know
15:52
that shaking has definitely begun and no
15:55
one can turn that back nobody can turn
15:57
back time nobody can stop
15:59
god from what he wants to do i just want
16:01
to encourage you all
16:02
really seriously keep celebration in
16:06
your heart
16:06
again god spoke to me and he said don't
16:09
get off the path i put you on
16:11
keep encouraging them to celebrate like
16:14
freedom
16:15
has already come because it
16:18
will so we want to remind you whether
16:21
they're still up tomorrow or not
16:23
whether anything is taken down i'm
16:25
talking about the actual social media is
16:27
taken down as the networks are taken
16:28
down
16:29
if all that is taken down you have to
16:31
remember this god has not
16:32
changed his mind and do not let fear
16:36
interfere in your life i'm not going to
16:40
and i will still be here when it's all
16:44
done
16:44
i do need to let you know that i've
16:46
become so popular with the
16:48
criminals and criminal activity that
16:51

16:52
fake cat curb it's called decatur
16:56
facebook page and again they're using

00:00
i do need uh pastors both to come up
00:03
here
00:03
i have some mantles to give out
00:07
both of you if i go there's going to be
00:11
mantles
00:12
and he doesn't do you know i can't just
00:14
say it
00:15
i have to do it that's the way it is
00:17
with me so um
00:18
yeah god has highly honored you and who
00:21
wouldn't right
00:22
i mean even a little bit of time i've
00:24
known you you're passionate you show
00:26
people
00:27
and you're hungry and you are so
00:30
determined and fierce
00:32
those are the kind of people god needs
00:34
to do things for him
00:35
those who want to be quiet and are you
00:37
know i i hid in the i didn't hide he had
00:40
me hidden for years but now of course
00:41
with pink hair you can't hide
00:43
so be glad he didn't ask you to have it
00:48
he was going to make sure i couldn't
00:49
hide and i was known by 40 pastors in
00:52
our city i did all kinds of things for
00:53
them my dad did we just love
00:55
people we didn't care who you were we
00:57
loved you
00:58
about we were fierce against the
01:00
darkness
01:01
and you are totally fierce against the
01:03
darkness
01:05
and i absolutely love the name of your
01:07
church because i have friends who are
01:10
some of the hosts and uh you may think
01:13
that is strange don't think it's strange
01:15
angels appeared all over
01:16
the new in the old testament and
01:18
actually came and ate with
01:20
uh you know some of the greats of that
01:22
day but
01:23
you don't worship them okay it doesn't
01:27
actually say you can't talk to them
01:29
if someone if one gives comes to give
01:30
you a word from god
01:32
make sure you by the way i have to add
01:34
this in there always test
01:35
the spirits there are groups out there
01:38
teaching you to
01:39
you know send yourself somewhere and do
01:41
all kinds of things but you have to test
01:43
and if an angel appears to you and says
01:45
come with me you better ask them
01:47
are you of the spirit of the most high
01:49
god who sent his son to die for the sins
01:50
of this world
01:52
because if they're not they will
01:53
disappear
01:55
and they can't answer wrong with that
01:57
i've done that since i was real little i
02:00
always would test them even though i go
02:01
to heaven all the time
02:02
and i'm around angels all the time they
02:04
live over my home in my home
02:06
and if something appears to me though i
02:09
will still ask them that
02:11
there is a safety measure that needs to
02:13
be taught because more and more
02:15
pastors will find out we are connected
02:18
in the spirit realm with heaven that's
02:19
where our rulership
02:20
is we don't rule over people we rule
02:22
over all the darkness trying to control
02:24
people and some some of those beings
02:28
those demons can appear as angels of
02:30
light and stuff like that i mean they
02:31
can
02:32
they can be very convincing like the
02:33
left is trying to be right now
02:36
but anyway just test the spirit so don't
02:39
reject something i want
02:41
god wants okay he wants you to know him
02:44
he wants to know all about him he wants
02:46
you to understand who you are
02:47
why he sent you in this particular time
02:49
on the earth this is a powerful time the
02:51
divine decade
02:52
but then also 24 years in the white
02:55
house god will have total
02:57
and then after that that 24 years
02:58
prepares us for the next
03:00
100 years if you thought you were
03:03
leaving
03:04
you're not going anywhere so don't hide
03:08
get your crown on roll up your rapture
03:09
rug you can keep it for later or someone
03:11
down the road
03:12
someone generations from now might need
03:14
that okay and i just need to say this
03:16
for free the holy spirit say is free
03:18
the rapture will not be a rescue party
03:22
it will be a celebration of such glory
03:25
and power
03:27
it is a party say it's a party
03:31
it's not a rescue party it's a party
03:34
party
03:37
so uh i i knew what was coming before
03:40
you invited me because you know he told
03:41
me
03:43
and he said you're gonna give out
03:44
mantels to them they both are going to
03:46
get mantles for this new season
03:48
and um that's why when he had me send
03:52
that word through sunil
03:53
he said bill bill bill he is serious
03:56
about the broadcasting i
03:58
believe you will have a network one day
04:01
because you already taken authority
04:05
in that whole system and the frequencies
04:07
in the in the in the ways that come
04:08
through to produce that you're already
04:10
ruling in that
04:12
and by the way the first thing he wants
04:13
me to tell you is you have reached the
04:15
level of
04:15
king in the spirit realm and uh only god
04:19
chooses who the kings the lords and the
04:20
priests are those are spiritual levels
04:22
of authority
04:23
that's why he says you are kings and
04:25
priests and to your god
04:26
that's not just a title that is a
04:29
position
04:31
and i know the church doesn't always
04:33
talk about that either but i understand
04:35
it completely what that means
04:36
so you reach the level of a king in the
04:38
spirit realm you can't go any higher
04:40
than that you're not god okay
04:41
we're lower than him but in the spirit
04:44
according to dominion and authority a
04:46
king is as high as you can get
04:48
and it comes because you fell in love
04:50
with jesus first
04:51
you can't skip jesus okay we can't skip
04:54
the word of god
04:55
you can't just elevate yourself
04:57
somewhere i know people have put
04:58
themselves in the five-fold ministry
05:00
that never belong there and they can get
05:02
away with that but you can't get away
05:03
with saying you're a king
05:04
because when you declare a decree
05:06
nothing will happen if you're not
05:09
but the kings actually have very high
05:11
rulership
05:12
and any king even in the natural realm
05:15
you have an
05:16
army so does the king in the spirit
05:19
realm
05:19
and this day i didn't just come by
05:21
myself i came with millions of the
05:24
army of heaven that i i command them get
05:27
used to that word say we command
05:29
because he commands god said
05:33
here you're going to get some revelation
05:34
on the scripture now when god said
05:36
command ye me he wasn't saying you tell
05:39
me what to do he was saying
05:41
me i want to see you command yes
05:44
command you me me i want to see you
05:47
command
05:48
and that's what he meant we have
05:50
authority and dominion jesus said i give
05:52
you power
05:53
over all the power of the enemy not
05:56
some of it some of the time all of it
05:59
all the time
06:00
but when you rule and take authority
06:02
over it you're ruling
06:04
and so the greater you get in those
06:06
levels of authority you
06:07
increase in many ways and so we may have
06:10
had angels helping us in the past
06:13
but since 2014 a scroll was opened in
06:16
heaven
06:16
that had the words on host initiative
06:20
okay it's that host initiative that's
06:22
what i'm wearing right here this is
06:24
their logo
06:25
they have a logo and it represents the
06:28
army of heaven
06:29
working with us but we are not we are
06:32
over angels right in authority
06:34
the angels are not over us do you
06:36
understand that
06:38
it says in the ages to come we will
06:39
judge them is that right
06:41
that means we have seniority because we
06:44
are we came from the heart of god he
06:46
made them by speaking but we were
06:48
birthed from him
06:49
and so because you've reached that level
06:51
of king he has sent with me
06:53
one million of the hosts of heaven
06:58
that are being positioned here i brought
07:00
my staff i didn't bring it here with me
07:01
but i brought my staff
07:03
to decree for them to be here and so
07:05
they're actually outside this building
07:07
right now one million
07:08
that you will command you will send them
07:10
you'll give them orders
07:12
to go and do things in the spirit realm
07:14
pull down strongholds that you see evil
07:16
or where
07:16
wherever evil and wickedness is going on
07:19
and i mean
07:20
for instance i take power over all the
07:22
part of the enemy
07:23
trying to cheat lie and steal and hide
07:26
and cover up
07:27
so i command the host of heaven to go
07:29
uncover all that that's being hidden
07:32
no matter where it is how long it's been
07:34
there or what it is you will go
07:36
now in jesus name and uncover all of
07:38
that pull down the strongholds of satan
07:40
that are helping them empowering them
07:42
inspiring
07:43
put down those strongholds that they no
07:44
longer can assist them in any weightless
07:46
ever
07:47
shred platforms the evil high levels of
07:49
evil and spirit realm are operating in
07:51
over
07:51
our country over all the stuff we
07:54
command the host of heaven now you go
07:56
and shred those platforms
07:57
when you do that fear begins to fall on
07:59
the humans
08:00
doing the wickedness as long as satan is
08:04
working with them empowering them and
08:06
inspiring them
08:07
they feel bold they feel like they own
08:11
it
08:12
but when that is removed they no longer
08:14
have that
08:16
this is how you rule the spirit realm
08:19
that's taking power over all the power
08:20
of the enemy i'm not controlling people
08:22
but i'm totally telling through the host
08:24
of heaven they were
08:26
made to war for us
08:29
you don't want the spirit roman battle
08:31
anything
08:32
right we are more than conquerors
08:36
they are a weapon for us
08:39
weapons are not natural they are
08:41
spiritual right they are mighty
08:43
say they it didn't say it in the bible
08:47
they are mighty to the pulling down the
08:49
strongholds and one of the ones those
08:50
weapons
08:51
is the army of heaven
08:54
and we get to command them if you're not
08:57
playing games in the darkness
09:01
they hearken unto the word of the lord
09:03
in you so what you say if it doesn't
09:04
sound like the lord or if you're out
09:06
there blasting people
09:07
crushing and hurting people with your
09:09
mouth or your spouse or
09:10
whatever you're doing that's not godly
09:13
they don't have to listen to you
09:16
so there are requirements okay you've
09:19
got to have accountability
09:20
if you have an authority like that you
09:22
have to god knows he can trust you
09:24
he trusts them that's what he said to me
09:27
so this day
09:28
you are being right now your army
09:30
outside right now
09:31
you need to say i choose to invite
09:35
heaven's army to be my weapon
09:39
to fight against the darkness i receive
09:42
them right now
09:50
[Music]
09:52
and i i have i have two mantles that
09:55
came out up here
09:57
uh this one actually belongs to both of
09:59
you but this one is just for you
10:00
[Laughter]
10:03
i'm going to give brenda hers first
10:05
isn't it beautiful
10:07
and so is she to him so chief you're
10:10
beautiful to the lord and so he wants to
10:12
bless you with his mantle
10:14
and it's got many pieces in this mantle
10:17
it's all the things you'll get to do
10:18
that you desire to do because you have
10:21
been willing to do those things that
10:22
aren't the best that aren't always
10:24
comfortable there are always uh uh that
10:28
that maybe other people would not want
10:29
to do you've been willing to say yes to
10:31
love people
10:32
for him to support your husband to love
10:34
your husband
10:35
i would say love your husband love your
10:36
husband you've been willing so he is
10:38
giving you this is actually a mantle of
10:40
beauty
10:41
beauty from heaven and you will get
10:43
great reward
10:45
do this so this is yours in this day
10:48
and i can tell you that we are seated in
10:52
heavenly places because he takes a layer
10:54
of our soul that looks just like you the
10:55
layers in your soul are images of you
10:58
those are your emotions when you give
11:00
yourself to jesus christ he has the
11:02
right to take that and he seats it with
11:03
him in heavenly places so you are really
11:05
seated
11:06
it's not just something suggested it's
11:08
not symbolic there is a layer of view in
11:10
heaven
11:10
looks just like you and at this moment
11:12
he just put that
11:14
mantle upon you it is a mantle of
11:17
greatness
11:19
greatness love and beauty and so there
11:21
you go
11:22
get ready for great things to happen and
11:25
fun things to happen okay amen and i
11:28
know
11:29
this is another mantle
11:43
[Music]
11:45
this is a mantle of presidential
11:49
favor and even though it has trump's
11:52
name he is president
11:54
he will sit as president for four more
11:55
years no matter what anyone else says
11:58
that is god's plan so he's putting on
12:00
you not just for this president
12:03
but for many presidents to come you will
12:06
have favor from god
12:08
and they will have your ear to hear god
12:12
and your hand in friendship
12:15
so this is a mantle right now of
12:17
governmental authority
12:20
presidential favor that's what he called
12:22
a presidential favor
12:24
and that includes you and your wife but
12:26
he wanted me to place it on you
12:28
as a head come here you just get
12:29
underneath there too there you go
12:31
so father right now i i establish and
12:35
set upon your children the mantle of
12:38
presidential
12:39
favor which means they already have
12:42
favor without measure with you
12:44
they will have facial favor without
12:46
measure with the presidents with
12:48
president trump
12:49
and with other presidents coming and so
12:51
long as you have them hear god
12:53
they will carry and operate in this
12:55
mantle
12:56
and they will find out very quickly that
12:58
is going to begin
12:59
soon so receive it in jesus name
13:03
and i bless them god and i thank you for
13:05
the army of heaven that's been assigned
13:07
to them father that it will continue to
13:09
grow
13:09
the more you send them the more you get
13:11
them
13:12
i thank you father in jesus name so be
13:16

and we can actually do that today for
13:56
whoever wants to
13:58
you have to invite i know this protocol
14:00
for heaven
14:01
did you not invite christ into your life
14:03
is that right
14:05
i hope you say yes you invite it's the
14:08
way heaven is you invite
14:09
christ to come into your life you must
14:12
invite
14:12
holy spirit to indwell you is that
14:15
correct
14:16
you have to invite heaven to be a weapon
14:18
for you no they were created for that
14:21
the army of heaven was never
14:24
ever designed to protect heaven
14:28
they don't need it
14:31
and actually they didn't even get to
14:33
throw lucifer out and one-third of the
14:35
angels they didn't get to throw them out
14:38
they wanted to trust me i don't know
14:40
what all these people think about this
14:41
whole thing going on they said there was
14:42
sadness in heaven they were weeping
14:44
they were rejoicing they threw a party
14:46
when they were kicked out
14:49
god does have a government in heaven and
14:51
he has a way that he operates that
14:53
he doesn't abide evil
14:57
it gets unseated it gets kicked out
15:00
and that actually did happen in heaven
15:02
one day and so
15:04
those angels understand stuff that we're
15:06
going through right now they understand
15:07
what we're going through
15:09
some people have lost family members
15:10
over this whole thing
15:12
they really have they've lost businesses
15:14
and business partners and even churches
15:16
have split
15:17
people love churches because they're
15:19
choosing the wrong thing
15:21
the wrong thing right you cannot choose
15:23
or partner with darkness and think
15:25
you're not going to get some kind of a
15:27
consequence of that you cannot side with
15:30
those who want to take
15:32
the life of people who have no love for
15:35
anybody that always is a sign that the
15:38
enemy is involved when life
15:40
want to be taken or controlled or
15:42
crushed uh
15:44
god never put america here actually
15:46
didn't put anyone here for that reason
15:48
but america was made specifically by god
15:51
for his own purposes in his plans
15:53
his will his way that's why even here in
15:56
america as we have fought so many times
15:59
to keep our ability to be free
16:05
but you don't have the right to hurt
16:07
crush and bash people
16:09
and i think the other half the left side
16:12
doesn't even know what that means they
16:13
have
16:14
no lives matter actually is what they
16:16
ought to be if you want to know the
16:17
truth no lives matter to them
16:20
no lives matter to them not even the
16:22
people they're using
16:24
matter to them they don't care
16:27
this is the way the enemy is satan
16:29
doesn't care who he uses he doesn't care
16:31
who he destroys
16:32
he doesn't care who gets stolen from
16:35
and as i so today i am going to talk
16:37
about america
16:39
i can't help that that's god's biggest
16:41
thing right now with me
16:42
back in 2015 the beginning god caught me
16:45
up to heaven and said
16:47
um trump's going to win and he'll be in
16:49
the white house for eight years because
16:50
i need him there
16:53
even though it might seem impossible
16:55
it's going to happen
16:57
he said i'm going to shift america onto
17:00
my
17:00
timeline and into righteousness
17:04
and he said i even have inventions and
17:06
things to be created that i will not
17:08
allow to be created until i've dealt
17:10
with the darkness
17:12
that's in the government and great
17:14
exposure
17:16
to levels people never dreamed of this
17:17
is still god speaking to me
17:19
will happen he said it will be great
17:22
some people will not understand it
17:24
they'll think i've abandoned them i have
17:26
not abandoned them i'm actually setting
17:27
up
17:28
their lives for the next 100 years
17:33
[Applause]
17:38
this country is a light to this world
17:40
that light will get
17:41
greater the body of christ will learn
17:45
how to operate in authority and dominion
17:47
and it will be so hard for anything like
17:50
what we are experiencing to ever happen
17:52
again
17:53
not until the perilous time is coming
17:55
nobody knows that day
17:58
don't plan your life around when the
17:59
perilous times are
18:01
don't plan your life around the rapture
18:04
you have way too much to do
18:07
we're just beginning to understand the
18:10
operations of the spirit roman even who
18:12
we really
18:12
are we are meant to be in authority in
18:16
this earth
18:18
we're not under anything
18:24
if you belong to jesus christ he's not
18:26
under anything
18:27
either
18:30
on earth as it is in heaven is what god
18:32
has always desired
18:34
and yes god does have a dream
18:37
it is him and mankind operating together
18:40
as one
18:43
and so great days have to happen on this
18:45
earth
18:46
there has to be those days and everybody
18:49
thinks well some people think
18:50
i always get corrected but if i change
18:52
what i just instantly said the holy
18:53
spirit just tell me what to say
18:56
some people think it's the end because
18:57
things are so awful
18:59
they're not awful okay i know they may
19:02
be hard and inconvenient and i know yes
19:04
people have been affected by this
19:06
that was not god's plan but there is an
19:08
enemy in this world and when he can find
19:10
people who are wicked and evil to do his
19:13
plan they're going to do it if they've
19:14
already said yes to him
19:16
they're going to do it and that can
19:18
affect our life
19:19
but in the future it will be much harder
19:22
because of the discernment we'll be
19:24
walking in the understanding of who we
19:26
are living and taking authority
19:28
uh practically almost everywhere in this
19:30
world wherever the body of christ lives
19:32
he actually is going to create regions
19:34
of light in this country
19:39
probably the first country because he
19:40
calls this god
19:42
called his gift to this world i know his
19:44
son is
19:45
but he means literally it is a gift for
19:48
hope
19:49
for a future where to find him how to
19:51
know him
19:52
how to live free free
20:02
in order to live free you have to have
20:05
justice
20:06
you can't be free without justice so
20:09
what is god doing today
20:11
serving out justice
20:13
[Applause]
20:16
he said i could not allow trump just to
20:18
win normally
20:20
he won oh trust me he won
20:26
he did win but he said i couldn't let
20:28
him win the normal way because the
20:29
darkness would have remained hidden
20:34
what he's got planned for us is so great
20:37
and the ability to do things and help
20:39
people and even
20:41
change things drastically for the better
20:45
and the greater would be a better word
20:47
to use
20:49
for the greater of god's purposes in
20:51
this country he had to deal with the
20:53
darkness that's been hidden for years
20:57
so he already had a plan
21:01
it wasn't the scam democrat
21:05
and it wasn't the pandemic which by the
21:07
way has been lied about most of the time
21:13
because god said they'll use anything
21:15
they can to keep people away from each
21:16
other keep their mouths
21:18
muffled and not speak and say anything
21:20
don't let them gather together because
21:22
then they'll know
21:23
truth because they'll be together it's
21:24
they're too strong together
21:26
so they came up with a lot of these
21:28
plans
21:30
amen
21:31
[Applause]
21:34
and all this that was going on god said
21:36
i haven't changed my plan it's working
21:41
and he said i will the only one i'll be
21:43
the only one who gets the glory for all
21:45
this but of course he wants the glory
21:47
amen
21:51
so he already knew this stuff would
21:52
happen he knew it
21:54
but we who are the body should
21:58
always remain strong
22:02
really strong if you represent christ in
22:05
this world you represent heaven on earth
22:06
we represent heaven on earth
22:09
one day you'll go there if you die
22:15
y'all stand at me
22:19
what if you chose you to remain
22:22
but if you're here for the millennial
22:24
reign would you want that
22:28
there will be some that will i'm not
22:31
planning on dying
22:34
he won't let me talk about dying he
22:37
won't let me talk about retiring there
22:38
is no retirement okay
22:41
you don't retire in heaven you have a
22:42
lot of fun and recreation and
22:45
using your powerful gift that you love
22:48
whether it's tennis or horseback riding
22:50
or running a
22:51
rodeo or a old antique car show or if
22:54
you're a baker if you're in the theater
22:56
it's all in heaven
22:58
it's your gift he put it in you before
23:02
he sent you here
23:05
raise up a child in the way in the bent
23:07
in the gift i gave them to be and
23:09
they'll never depart from it
23:12
that's actually what that scripture this
23:13
revelation it's one of the first things
23:15
he taught me
23:16
he said parents that sit there all week
23:18
long trying to figure out what their
23:20
child's spiritual gift is
23:23
is true we'll all sit here and figure
23:25
out what what is my spiritual gift
23:27
well in heaven you don't use your
23:28
spiritual gift people
23:31
that's why we all think we'll be bored
23:35
it's the passion he put in you it's what
23:37
he gave you that you're good at that you
23:39
think about night and day if you could
23:40
be paid to do it you do it
23:44
your whole mansion is being designed
23:46
around that gift
23:48
if you were gonna have a rodeo you'd
23:49
have thousands of horses you have all
23:51
the property you have real supernatural
23:53
places for people to come and
23:54
be a part of that and the horse would be
23:56
yelling you the whole time oh i'm
23:57
bucking you
23:58
[Laughter]
24:00
it's heaven
24:06
but right now he wants you here
24:09
he needs you here he needs you to not
24:13
just be
24:14
he doesn't want you just to wake up he
24:16
wants you to wake up
24:18
stand up and stand out
24:22
you need to stand out by the way you
24:25
live your life the choices you make
24:27
that you make your stain and you don't
24:29
back down
24:32
you do not let fear interfere in your
24:36
life
24:38
fear should have no part of you he has
24:40
not
24:41
given us a spirit of fear
24:45
and i know a lot of people think well he
24:46
didn't send you know spirits of fear
24:48
no in your spirit
24:51
man he never put fear
24:57
that is something that comes from the
24:59
enemy the enemy brings fear but god
25:01
didn't give you a spirit of fear
25:02
he didn't put fear in your spirit man
25:07
it's not even in you he doesn't send you
25:09
with it in you
25:13
you should be free from that he wants
25:16
you
25:18
again
25:23
you know who you are in christ when you
25:26
become
25:26
dangerous against hell
25:29
they don't want to be around you they
25:31
beg not to be assigned to you
25:34
do
25:38
because they know when they go back and
25:39
they haven't fulfilled their assignment
25:41
to get you dragged
25:42
into the darkness they will be beaten
25:44
satan doesn't reward anybody
25:47
he does control with fear even in hell
25:52
so his plan is for us all to be
25:54
dangerous against
25:57
then there's no way fear can get in you
26:00
there's no place for it to even enter in
26:02
you're so
26:02
full of him so full of the authority he
26:06
gave you and the knowledge of him
26:07
and understanding and having revelation
26:09
from him revelation on the word
26:11
revelation is a lifestyle
26:16
heaven culture isn't just a something
26:20
it is a lifestyle
26:26
then you are dangerous
26:29
and every word that comes out of your
26:30
mouth will be powerful because it's
26:32
filled with love with life with hope
26:35
he said always be ready with an answer
26:38
yeah the issue is there but the answer
26:42
is
26:42
him so how well do you know him
26:49
if you want to know him more you pursue
26:51
it
26:53
amen
26:56
i was raised as a child one of fifteen
27:00
i knew it wasn't about me when i was
27:04
three
27:06
why because there were others already in
27:07
the household by the time i was eight i
27:09
was a mini parent
27:12
i didn't have anything given to me on a
27:14
golden platter
27:15
but i sure was watching those platters
27:20
60 loads of laundry a week 50 pounds of
27:23
potato a week
27:25
to peel
27:29
and all those chiefs to watch over
27:32
because
27:32
none of them were indians okay none of
27:34
them
27:35
don't mean that in the wrong way they
27:38
were leaders
27:39
and they knew it that's why he had to
27:43
give a sear into the household they
27:45
couldn't get away with nothing
27:49
i knew what they were doing if i was not
27:51
even there
27:54
i wasn't easy to live with i'm still not
27:56
easy to live with
27:58
we'll go place oh we need to pray about
28:00
that okay don't go in there
28:02
don't sit there cleanse it for the
28:03
kingdom there are scum on it
28:06
i don't sit anywhere without going i
28:08
cleanse it for the kingdom let me never
28:10
switch mics
28:12
it's probably my electron whatever
28:17
oh does it you having a there is an
28:20
electro
28:20
energy i can't remember how they tell me
28:22
i can't wear a watch
28:24
even in the natural is speeds
28:28
it does something
28:34
so god made me before he sent me he sent
28:37
me as a seer
28:38
that is god's right but there are people
28:41
who have that gift that also can the
28:43
enemy knows
28:45
if you have that gift by your reactions
28:47
and how you how you respond and say
28:49
things about things
28:50
but so since it was little i could see
28:52
angels or demons i saw either one
28:55
and by the time i was like 10 11 12. i
28:57
knew how the enemy operated i could go
28:59
tell people don't go there don't do that
29:01
this is what happens in the spirit when
29:02
you do that you don't want that to
29:04
you know and they look at me like i was
29:06
wild i didn't care
29:08
he also gave me an attitude of i don't
29:10
care i don't care what you think
29:12
it doesn't bother me i am not afraid of
29:14
the face of man i've seen the face of
29:16
god
29:18
and by the way yes you can see the face
29:20
of god
29:21
if you receive jesus christ as your
29:23
savior you think you're going to get
29:24
holier when you get there
29:27
you think you have to have a special
29:28
pass when you die to get into the throne
29:30
room to see him
29:32
say no you've been washing the blood of
29:35
the lamb
29:37
your name is written in the lamb's book
29:38
of life
29:40
he is building your mansion
29:45
i do love it that he used john the
29:48
beloved the one who jesus loved i
29:50
i just john was a showman he really was
29:52
he was the son of thunder what
29:54
do you think yeah him and his brother
29:57
used to fight over
29:58
pretty girls in the beginning of jesus
30:02
ministry
30:04
one day god the father took me back and
30:06
showed me a day in the life of christ
30:09
when he was just starting a minister and
30:11
he had the the rabble
30:13
i'm talking about the disciples
30:16
the ones who were with him right and
30:19
they had left people and they left
30:21
things that they were doing
30:23
and luke had patience running down the
30:25
street asking him why did you leave us
30:26
for him
30:28
this is this is a this is him going into
30:30
minister christ and all these people
30:31
they were throwing stones at the tax
30:33
collector
30:35
because the tax culturals didn't usually
30:36
go out and mingle
30:39
they stayed in their little shop okay
30:41
and you come in paid
30:42
but when cuz because he was out there he
30:44
was a target so here's them they're
30:46
ducking from the stones for him
30:48
listening to the patients yelling at
30:50
luke why did you leave him for us
30:51
and then there's james and john fighting
30:53
along the side of the road over two
30:54
pretty girls
30:56
this is jesus a mighty man sent by god
30:59
to share the good news
31:01
and this is who's walking with him and
31:03
there's the other one with his
31:04
hand in the money bag all the time
31:08
and the father said i didn't make it
31:10
easy for him
31:12
either
31:17
because i also am the ce ceo of one
31:21
quest international
31:23
i actually do have a position i have a
31:25
corporation
31:27
it's called one quest for one god to
31:30
create heaven on earth to reveal and
31:33
create heaven on earth
31:34
and so i do have uh i worked in the
31:36
business world for 25 years and i loved
31:38
it
31:38
then god said okay i'm taking you out of
31:40
your cushy job
31:42
i'm taking you out and then i'm going to
31:43
take your husband out a year later
31:45
so you're really going to have to love
31:46
me and believe me
31:50
we slept on people's floors for a while
31:51
i still celebrated i didn't change who i
31:53
was
31:54
i worshiped i gave i served the whole
31:57
time we were sleeping on people's floors
31:59
and people thought we were crazy and my
32:01
daughter spent
32:02
their birth each had a birthday sleeping
32:04
on somebody's floor
32:07
we ate whatever was there put everything
32:09
we had in the storage and
32:10
just trusted god at the end of one year
32:14
somebody walks up with keys to a million
32:16
dollar condo
32:18
at pond division beach and said here you
32:20
go just stay here long as you want
32:23
didn't cost us a penny or a dime because
32:25
we did not
32:26
change who we were even in the midst of
32:30
something that people would say it was a
32:31
disaster
32:34
my own daughters called it an adventure
32:38
they belong to me okay we had adventures
32:42
we never had disasters we never had a
32:44
crisis it was an adventure
32:48
you have to live like that so people see
32:51
you
32:51
if they don't understand oh no i love
32:53
him more than anyone else
32:55
i'm in his hand not some other somebody
32:57
of the person's hand
33:00
i trusted him
33:06
it's a way of life
33:09
and then i said yes every time he wanted
33:11
something every time he required
33:12
something to me i never said
33:13
never said no to him i'll be almost 70.
33:16
i forget how old i am it doesn't matter
33:20
i'm getting younger
33:23
because i'm claiming timeless you tell
33:25
me that one day do you want to old do
33:26
you want to get old
33:28
well not particularly well then do you
33:29
want to be timeless
33:31
i said yes he said whatsoever you say
33:33
you don't doubt in your heart
33:35
but believe that it will come to pass
33:36
you'll have whatever you say so i'm
33:38
timeless
33:40
and i have pink hair
33:46
and god asked me to have the pink hair
33:47
that really gets some pastors
33:52
not the black ones
33:55
oh no girl
33:58
they like this
34:02
there's a white woman who preaches
34:05
and she has a pink hair we gotta have
34:07
her come
34:09
that's not what the white one said you
34:10
are too over threads you have fallen off
34:12
the edge
34:13
god would never do that no we can't do
34:15
that to the people
34:17
and say your people come to my meetings
34:25
they will find some way to find me
34:27
because they want revelation about
34:29
heaven about god about who they are
34:32
they're hungry you need to take it up a
34:35
notch in your church
34:37
[Applause]
34:40
it is very true i have like what fifteen
34:43
thousand
34:44
black friends i do
34:48
and they won't let me leave they make me
34:50
they make me speak four or five hours
34:52
they don't care if people miss dinner if
34:53
they miss lunch they don't
34:55
they don't even care they reset the
34:58
clock i don't know how many times i went
35:00
to this one church
35:05
i went to this really nice church i was
35:07
invited i went to help rescue this
35:08
little
35:09
woman pastor she was gonna get out of
35:12
the ministry because she was being beat
35:13
up by other pastors saying she didn't
35:15
belong there
35:16
and so i went to this little tiny place
35:18
outside of washington dc and
35:20
after three days she was ready to never
35:22
quit
35:24
and this other the other they found out
35:26
about me so they come so i stayed in
35:27
like this little hotel that had cracks
35:29
under the door
35:30
that you know you stuff things
35:32
underneath it hoping nothing to crawl in
35:35
that's where i had to stay when i was
35:37
there and then the other one
35:38
said oh we found out you're in the area
35:40
we're going to let you minister and they
35:41
sent limos
35:44
and they put me in the wealthiest hotel
35:46
in washington dc
35:48
and they had a congregation of 5000
35:51
people
35:52
and i had given all my money to this
35:54
other little pastor to help her
35:56
and um and god said he he gets so
35:59
blessed that my heart is to love that
36:01
was my
36:02
my earthly dad heart was to whatever i
36:04
get i'm giving away
36:06
that's why i have margaret
36:09
margaret was created to make money and
36:11
keep it i was created to give it away so
36:13
he had to put us both together she's my
36:14
sister-in-law by the way
36:16
and she married my brother that took
36:18
enough bravery right there
36:21
you ever heard me talk about rj there's
36:23
margaret she's r.j's
36:25
wife his solution to all this would just
36:29
be to kill all the bad people send him
36:30
to hell then we'll have a nice
36:32
nice time to that with my brother don't
36:34
ask him to counsel you if you are in sin
36:39
he will seriously say that i'll get my
36:41
gun
36:42
and we'll deal with it and as you're
36:44
dying over hell maybe you'll change your
36:46
mind
36:50
he really gets invitations from black
36:52
pastors
36:54
you're a man you come into my church
36:58
you didn't know you never know what
37:00
you're gonna get when i speak okay
37:03
my life was not very normal
37:08
but rj is my brother he's my older
37:10
brother and so
37:12
he got into all kinds of things he'd he
37:14
would always ask me because you know
37:16
he'd say i'm i'm braver than you
37:17
so you won't do this i i did not not
37:19
like send dangerous things or dumb
37:21
things but
37:22
like you won't stick your finger in this
37:23
tube because i will and you won't and i
37:25
did and then the fire pit department had
37:27
to come cut it off
37:29
those kind of things were seven eight
37:30
and nine years old so i went through
37:32
this whole testing time when my brother
37:33
too finally went you know i'm not dumb
37:35
anymore i'm not doing
37:36
it
37:39
but r.j usually if there's a killing
37:41
going on
37:42
they'll be he'll be there before the
37:44
police they'll find or he'll find the
37:46
villain for the police board
37:49
and he also was in the uh in the
37:51
military also but he's always been so
37:53
fierce
37:54
about un injustice he's friends with all
37:57
of our police department all of our fire
37:58
department
37:59
the military and he's about my size
38:03
and he's not afraid of anything hell's
38:05
angels invite him into their
38:06
to do funerals for them
38:10
because they'd rather get rid of you to
38:11
look at you but they know he's a godly
38:12
man
38:13
and he's he he's a biker he creates
38:15
hearties and stuff like that
38:17
so he's not normal he'll minister to
38:19
people in nursing homes we're about to
38:21
go to heaven
38:22
if you're wicked that person he'll send
38:24
you either there to the other place
38:28
and i grew up with him
38:32
was enough to humble anybody trust me
38:35
so we have all kinds of a mix in my
38:38
family then we have all the adopted ones
38:40
like really adopted
38:42
and so my dad was creative so we always
38:44
had fun things to do exciting things to
38:46
do at home
38:47
feed the 200 pets we could do a funeral
38:51
for a pet at the drop of a hat i guess
38:54
god thought maybe one day we'd actually
38:56
do real ones
38:57
i wouldn't do a normal one we'd have
39:00
cake
39:01
lined up by the casket
39:04
they'd have it in heaven right
39:08
we would have to have music we'd have to
39:09
have dancing and we'd have to have cake
39:12
if you want to do it the way they do it
39:14
in heaven
39:16
that's how they do it in heaven you go
39:18
up there you're having a celebration
39:20
party they have lots of cake everybody
39:21
dances in the throne and the father
39:23
greets you he gives you rewards
39:25
you get to go see your amazing mansion
39:27
and the whole time we're down here
39:28
mourning and grieving
39:30
upset we didn't have enough money to
39:32
spend on them when they don't need it
39:33
anymore
39:35
get cremated it's cheaper the holy
39:39
spirit told me to say that one time
39:41
tell me to get cremated it's okay we can
39:43
put the ashes back together
39:47
that that's what the holy spirit said so
39:49
there's a holy spirit quote right there
39:52
straight from heaven
39:53
we know where the ashes are okay
39:58
you can't get clean what if you died in
39:59
a fire and burn up you don't get your
40:01
body
40:04
you're going to get that body back
40:05
people you better be happy about it
40:08
it'll look amazing
40:12
in the bible it says you will be known
40:14
as you are known
40:16
you can't be someone else and he doesn't
40:18
want you to be someone else right now
40:21
don't let people influence you to be
40:23
somebody you're not
40:25
he wanted me up here he picked me out of
40:28
all the tribe of my family
40:33
i'm happy that he did
40:37
and i'm happy he put me in america
40:40
and i'm happy that our country
40:42
represents and stands for god
40:47
one nation under god
40:53
and and the father would talk to me all
40:55
the time ever since the elections right
40:57
before the elections the first time he
40:58
said i'm going to throw you out there so
40:59
far you'll never be able to go back
41:02
like go back where
41:06
i knew the the media would all act up
41:08
and you are so right he keeps telling me
41:10
that they'll lose their
41:11
many of them are going to lose their
41:12
networks just so you know that right now
41:15
and other networks will rise up that
41:16
will tell the truth
41:18
amen
41:23
and they'll give us the true news the
41:25
right
41:26
not the hidden the stuff you know not
41:28
not hiding things but letting us know
41:32
i travel overseas a lot and during this
41:34
whole first election that they had
41:36
i got talked to i mean strangers come up
41:38
to me and go you must be an american it
41:40
must be the pink hair
41:42
and we want to know what you think about
41:44
your president oh we in america
41:46
love our president don't watch
41:49
the fake news whatever you do because
41:51
they won't tell you the truth about
41:52
anything
41:54
and this is even like three years into
41:56
his term
41:57
and they went you know what they still
41:59
they have a problem they can't let go of
42:01
what they first started with which is
42:03
the bashing and the accusing
42:04
they said they don't actually give the
42:06
news
42:07
you find out almost nothing about what's
42:10
important
42:11
you keep hearing it's like they put it
42:13
on repeat all the time they're just
42:14
doing the same thing you know why
42:16
they've convinced their own soul
42:19
that stuff is true and when you get in
42:22
your soul you'll choose again
42:25
what you choose to do or say you'll
42:26
choose it again
42:28
that's what happens that's why people
42:31
who listen to it have changed
42:33
people who are nice and kind now are not
42:36
because they've
42:37
compromised their soul
42:40
and so the more people go and say oh no
42:42
you need to listen to what they're
42:43
saying
42:44
they're talking what's right i'm talking
42:46
about the what the people are saying
42:47
that haven't made any decisions
42:50
and there's still some who don't want
42:51
anybody because they don't like anything
42:53
they're hearing
42:55
you choose life
42:58
you always choose life
43:01
no matter who you vote for you choose
43:03
life amen god said this day i offer you
43:05
life and death what does he say
43:10
and so they've been hiding so actually
43:12
their whole mess has gotten worse
43:14
i'm talking about the news media still
43:16
out there it's important to know what's
43:18
going on
43:20
right we need to know news
43:23
good news correct news unbiased news
43:28
and he's going to raise up several
43:30
people i know for sure several
43:32
christians
43:32
that will have their own and first class
43:35
first-rate
43:36
network it's nice to have a show
43:41
it's nice to have a show somewhere but
43:42
he wants a network
43:45
that can replace the false networks that
43:47
are out there
43:50
and i can tell you right now there is
43:52
great fear
43:53
in the camp of the left and there's
43:55
great fear
43:56
they may not say it but they're great
43:58
they're terribly they're awfully afraid
43:59
some are already hiding
44:01
they're afraid in the news media they're
44:03
afraid you may see some people shortly
44:05
leave their
44:06
leave leave that to get out before
44:08
they're taken to prison
44:11
you cannot commit a federal crime and
44:13
not go to prison
44:16
a lot of people in the post office that
44:18
were paid to change ballots add ballots
44:20
steal ballots and
44:22
and that's why i always tell people
44:23
don't mail it in i always said never
44:25
mail it in don't mail it in it's too
44:27
easy for people to take
44:29
and i know there's two point some
44:30
million votes that were actually
44:32
taken away uh and even then
44:35
you know our president still he still
44:37
won even that
44:39
and there were created new ballasts that
44:41
were fed into the thing when they were
44:43
supposed to stop
44:44
counting and close down they weren't and
44:46
i was watching kenneth copeland also
44:48
that night i was
44:49
seeing you and he said okay we're just
44:51
going to go for the evening
44:52
and then they announced we're going to
44:54
stop counting the ballots
44:56
and the holy spirit said yes that's so
44:57
they can feed all the false ones in
45:00
he said this is when they're going to do
45:02
that this is the holy spirit saying
45:03
they're going to do the big switch this
45:04
is on the 3rd of november
45:06
and they're going to they're going to do
45:07
corruption and fraud
45:09
they're going to create brand new
45:10
ballots and replace the ones that
45:12
they've even harvested people's names
45:15
off of ballots and change those ballasts
45:17
and then
45:18
put those into the electoral machines
45:20
that's what they did
45:23
they caught people in illinois that were
45:26
throwing
45:27
trump's ballots by the bins into the
45:30
river
45:32
they were up they were arrested in time
45:33
because of course they were doing it
45:35
but it was filmed and people saw and
45:37
they threw them in the river
45:38
the thing about crime if you're going to
45:41
do
45:42
if you're going to do a scam or whatever
45:44
you want to call it if you're going to
45:45
commit
45:46
fraud on a large scale you don't have
45:48
teams of thousands of people with you
45:51
so you hire whoever's willing to do it
45:54
but when you hire these small time
45:56
criminals
45:58
guess who's going to yell first
46:03
they have no bond with those people
46:06
we are bonded by our love for god and
46:09
our love for our present we have a bond
46:12
and the one thing they weren't counting
46:14
on was that we weren't going to go along
46:17
with their scam
46:20
you can't convince people who know the
46:22
truth
46:23
to accept fraud you just can't convince
46:26
them and i mean he had these rallies
46:29
with forty thousand fifty thousand
46:30
people in it and i've never seen any
46:32
would buy these people
46:37
so where did all these millions of votes
46:40
come from
46:41
that he had no people to vote for him
46:46
i don't know why they don't think well i
46:48
think they're dumb maybe i don't know
46:51
they think we are but the one thing they
46:54
didn't count on
46:56
was the moral majority in this country
46:59
the moral majority they don't want
47:01
socialism
47:02
they don't want their rights taken away
47:04
they don't want to be controlled or
47:06
hand-fed
47:07
okay they don't want to become a
47:08
third-world country they have families
47:11
they have a future they want a destiny
47:14
for their own
47:15
children that's the moral majority and a
47:18
lot of those are believers but some even
47:20
aren't but they still want that kind of
47:22
life
47:22
they're not settling
47:26
and they could put those million dollar
47:28
ads on all day long
47:30
the only ones watching them the ones who
47:31
made them
47:34
it isn't changing us
47:37
and there are people who are blowing
47:39
whistles even in higher places and
47:41
they're very much afraid
47:43
but they can't they can't lose face
47:45
right now they got to keep
47:46
their momentum not with us they got to
47:49
keep their own momentum going for the
47:51
lie
47:52
they know they they know they stole it
47:55
they know they cheated they know that
47:56
they committed crimes
47:57
but they can't cave in
48:00
but there's a lot of ones under them
48:02
that don't want to take the fall
48:06
so on november the 4th god had said to
48:08
me
48:09
when the ground begins to shake
48:13
and at this time they were still doing
48:14
all the false stuff when the ground
48:16
begins to shake
48:17
you watch for the landslide
48:20
the landslide that will go cover from
48:23
the top to the bottom
48:24
when a landslide starts it starts with a
48:28
little shaking
48:30
and as that momentum builds with that
48:33
landslide
48:34
it gets louder and louder and more and
48:36
more
48:37
is pulled into that landslide until the
48:40
whole mountain has been uncovered
48:42
and god said that will be the crime the
48:44
corruption
48:46
all of the stuff the lying the cheating
48:48
the stealing it will all be made known
48:50
and even though they won't want to
48:52
report it can you get over that
48:54
they won't want to report it they cannot
48:56
stop
48:58
president trump from being announced as
49:01
the president
49:02
amen
49:06
he said it will start it will start with
49:08
one phone call and after that one call
49:10
is made and known
49:11
everyone else will be getting in line to
49:14
rat
49:15
on that whole group and even though it's
49:18
happening
49:19
they well they're it's like i think
49:21
they're in the fantasy they
49:23
think if they keep waiting long enough
49:25
they'll convince us to change our minds
49:26
and just drop the whole thing
49:29
now we're not giving our life away
49:32
we're not giving our destiny away we're
49:34
not selling our family down the river
49:37
we are here for the purpose that god put
49:40
us here for
49:41
and we are not to be controlled amen
49:46
and i don't know how long it take to get
49:47
into their heads
49:49
the other thing legally in the natural
49:52
you can't
49:53
call the presidency until all the votes
49:56
are counted
49:58
and i don't know if you know this
49:59
they're now recounting new york
50:03
they're even recounting the recounting
50:05
they're going to get to the thing where
50:06
they can recount all the states they
50:08
think that need to be recounted
50:09
they can't call the election there has
50:11
been nobody called
50:13
who has become president the media is
50:16
just making it up
50:18
hoping we'll believe it
50:23
i'm not believing that
50:27
that's not god's plan and that is not
50:31
what will happen we don't have to settle
50:33
in our lives right
50:35
millions of people i want you know this
50:37
have prayed around the world
50:39
who aren't even americans
50:41
[Applause]
50:44
because they don't want america to
50:46
become a third-world country
50:47
we stand for justice liberty and freedom
50:52
and we help many other countries and
50:54
have and still will
50:56
they don't want to see us they don't
50:58
want to see us fail
51:01
and even they don't believe the lie and
51:04
they don't even live here
51:08
just with statistics and proof it's
51:11
called proof people
51:13
even with the proof that all these
51:15
millions of people are following and
51:17
supporting trump
51:18
they still had a plan they already
51:21
planned this they had this plan before
51:22
he even started running again
51:24
they knew how they would steal it they
51:26
knew that they could do it they knew
51:28
there was a way to do it
51:29
they knew they could pull it off they
51:30
knew if the media would be on their side
51:32
that that's all what everybody would
51:34
believe
51:36
but they didn't and so i wanna
51:39
i wanna encourage people don't
51:42
talk about losing
51:49
you don't talk about losing when god is
51:52
still working his plan
51:56
why we have already won
52:01
we have already won we won because we
52:04
voted we won because we prayed we won
52:06
because it was god's plan
52:09
and all that is needed in the natural
52:11
realm
52:12
has already happened for president trump
52:14
to keep his
52:15
seat amen
52:19
and and god a god god who knows
52:22
everything of course
52:23
he told me because i'll just be walking
52:25
around all of a sudden he'll just
52:26
start talking to me when i say god i
52:28
mean the father
52:30
yes i hear jesus all the time people
52:32
find the craziest things to say about
52:33
you
52:34
one thing you don't even know jesus you
52:36
don't mention him oh yes he is my first
52:38
love and i talk about him all the time
52:39
you must not be listening to the right
52:40
videos
52:43
i have nothing without him i am nothing
52:46
without him
52:47
i'd have no future i would have nothing
52:53
but i do have him and i know him well
52:58
i know what happened to him on the cross
52:59
i know what happened to him in the
53:00
garden i know what happened to him in
53:02
hell
53:02
i know what happened to him when he went
53:04
back to heaven and poured out his blood
53:05
on the mercy seat
53:06
i know what was happening in hell when
53:08
he was pouring his blood out in the
53:09
mercy seat
53:10
the loser was in hell groveling in the
53:14
dirt
53:15
of hell stripped of all his gemstones
53:19
broken and beaten by the son of god
53:22
and no longer had the keys to hell death
53:25
and the grave
53:27
so he took his beauty
53:30
and he took his authority away from him
53:35
that gave us absolutely the right to
53:38
operate in authority in this world
53:42
satan is a false king he's not even a
53:44
king he's a false prince
53:46
a false one who never was given
53:48
authority or the right to do anything
53:52
he took what he wanted and used it while
53:54
he can and that
53:55
side no matter what name you give them
53:57
that does the same thing as all
53:59
the same thing is always what satan
54:01
wants he wants it his own way he wants
54:03
people to worship him he wants him to
54:05
only
54:05
exist with him and that's what happens
54:08
no matter what you put name or tag you
54:10
put on that
54:12
that is satan's plan is to
54:15
kill steal and destroy every person and
54:18
everything
54:20
that's why he is afraid of america
54:24
satan hates america because it causes
54:27
them more
54:28
problems than any other country because
54:30
we preach the gospel from here we train
54:33
people and send them with the gospel
54:35
we go over there and help people learn
54:36
how to give the gospel
54:38
we feed people everywhere we're doing
54:40
kind acts we care about people we rescue
54:43
people for him
54:45
if you were the enemy you wouldn't want
54:47
any of that so what is your plan i'm
54:48
going to take over
54:51
i will deceive them this thing's going
54:52
to stop i can't take it anymore
54:54
it's not working with my plan i'm going
54:56
to take over this country i'm taking it
54:58
for myself
54:59
there's enough wicked people here i can
55:01
already get to use to do that
55:02
but what he didn't count on
55:06
was we have the truth living in us
55:10
it's not something we hear is something
55:12
that lives with us
55:14
and the one who brings the truth lives
55:16
in us
55:17
why would he think we would believe a
55:20
lie
55:22
[Applause]
55:26
you need help if you want to believe a
55:29
lie
55:31
we'll have deliverance right now
55:36
you walk in the truth you live the truth
55:41
you breathe it you speak it
55:44
he came to set us
55:47
free
55:48
[Applause]
55:55
justice is on one of the steps of his
55:58
throne
55:59
huge words justice yes he wants
56:03
justice yes he wants accountability
56:06
yes he wants people to pay for the
56:08
things they have done wrong
56:11
but those who are at the top that lead
56:13
others into it
56:14
are in even more trouble with god
56:18
when you deceive others to join you and
56:20
twist
56:21
the truth and ruin their future and
56:24
ruin their destiny and so many have been
56:27
brought into that place right now
56:29
and i always encourage them if you're
56:31
listening go
56:32
tell the truth while you still can
56:39
go repent and they'll cur turn them in
56:43
tell the truth about the crimes that
56:44
were committed
56:47
and i have sent the host on a daily
56:49
basis
56:51
to encourage people who committed those
56:53
crimes to tell the truth
56:56
do it now while you can don't wait till
56:59
it's too late you'll go to prison
57:03
you know satan tells people things all
57:05
the time do you know the spirit of god
57:07
does too
57:10
he can speak to people to inspire them
57:12
to encourage them
57:13
and heaven wants us to remain free
57:18
because he has god has a plan i'm
57:21
telling you for
57:21
24 years in the white house he's not
57:24
willing
57:25
to tell trump oh you can wait four years
57:28
and then i'll put you in then
57:31
can you imagine the one who made
57:33
everything
57:34
holds the air you breathe no
57:37
has been from the beginning then they've
57:39
been could you ever see him oh i guess
57:41
i'll have to change
57:41
my plan
57:45
we don't understand his ways but we need
57:48
to
57:52
everything that's happening is to set us
57:54
up for the next 100 years
57:57
the inventions that are waiting they're
57:59
just beyond your imagination
58:01
that god's gonna send to this earth to
58:03
help people
58:04
and make their life better
58:08
cancer will be here no more i really
58:11
believe they already have a cure they
58:12
just don't want you to know it
58:14
there'll come a time as this
58:16
administration
58:17
trumps administration and then pence is
58:20
after that for eight years and then
58:26
i i live prophecy i live it
58:29
and he doesn't just show me a few years
58:33
i clearly know what will happen for the
58:35
next 50 years
58:37
clearly have seen it and been there
58:43
god's not changing his mind in his
58:46
master plan
58:47
for america he needs who he
58:51
chose in that office when he chose him
58:55
to be there
58:56
and he is not willing to let the enemy
58:59
have
59:00
those times
59:07
some of the greatest leaders in the body
59:09
of christ are still being born
59:15
who is throwing mountains into the sea
59:18
who's walking on air are raising the
59:20
dead that were cremated
59:23
who's stopping an earthquake and make it
59:25
go back the way it was before it came
59:27
including the dead being raised
59:30
and the buildings going back together
59:33
that's the greater works
59:38
why would he all of a sudden decide
59:41
i just don't want this his son
59:44
died so he could have that happen
59:47
the death of his son and resurrection of
59:49
his son was so these things could happen
59:52
in this world that he created so they
59:55
could happen and people would know there
59:57
is a god
60:02
he told me he was erasing the gray area
60:04
that existed in america what's the gray
60:06
area
60:07
the one saying there is no god
60:11
that is getting smaller and smaller
60:13
there come a point where people know
60:15
i'm either in the darkness or i'm in the
60:16
light there's there's no hiding there's
60:18
no wondering
60:19
you know who people believe and what
60:22
they live they'll either live in regions
60:24
of darkness
60:27
and it will be legal and they'll be
60:29
living in regions of light
60:31
the great light the greater light
60:34
regions and cities sometimes more than
60:36
one city
60:37
and people will drive their dead family
60:39
members in there and they'll come to
60:40
life that's how powerful
60:42
the presence of god will be the
60:44
authority of the believer will be great
60:46
in these regions of light sickness can't
60:49
abide no crime
60:51
i saw demons flee like dust out of these
60:54
cities to get out because it was
60:56
painful for them the annoying king that
61:00
was put in you when you were born again
61:01
is painful to the enemy
61:04
what anointing the anointing that breaks
61:07
the yoke
61:10
you have it first john 2
61:13
27 there's a scripture for all you who
61:15
want that
61:17
it's in the bible
61:22
i have a little cd i made and we made it
61:26
in this very old church because the
61:27
pastor thomas
61:29
he gave himself up and ran from a
61:31
denominational church they
61:33
tried to steal his church in mississippi
61:36
in the heart of mississippi in this
61:39
little tiny town
61:40
it says little town where big things
61:42
happen and it's one little pastor stood
61:44
up to all the other
61:46
religious people trying to shut him up
61:47
and didn't want him speaking about
61:49
certain things and
61:50
so finally they said in in two weeks
61:52
you'll be out of here and he stood up in
61:53
the church and
61:54
he was the pastor and he said okay i'm
61:56
leaving now whoever would like to follow
61:58
me and have life and have holy spirit
62:00
just come they all left with him
62:05
i think he had four elders left
62:10
and he started this church it was never
62:12
got really huge but man the
62:13
impact it had on that whole little town
62:16
and he found out about me
62:17
i think i went to his place like eight
62:19
times in like two years
62:21
and they ended up by getting people
62:22
together and they trained them and
62:24
trained them in the host and they ran
62:25
witchcraft out of town
62:28
they ran it out i mean you talk about
62:29
manifestations they
62:31
they had them everybody was afraid of
62:33
the witches
62:34
and uh god said when you go this time
62:36
witchcraft will be run out they will run
62:37
it out
62:39
and when we were leaving down when
62:41
margaret and i were leaving
62:43
we had pictures in the sky
62:48
of a witch leaving town
62:53
leaving town those people are so
62:54
determined we want to be free from the
62:56
effect and the control
62:58
witchcraft is not a joke
63:02
don't watch it
63:06
don't watch it don't read it
63:10
it's all about controlling people that's
63:12
what they're for
63:15
it's not a joke one of the things coming
63:19
one day because you know whenever god
63:20
does some great things the enemy brings
63:22
in a counterfeit
63:24
right well people will begin to know
63:26
okay well i can't believe this lie
63:27
anymore it's too obvious that god is
63:29
here
63:30
it's going to get more and more obvious
63:31
that there is a god his name is jesus
63:33
christ
63:34
and so it will be hard for the devil to
63:36
come up with new things but one of the
63:37
things he will have
63:38
at that time will be good witchcraft
63:42
because all the movies are preparing
63:43
people for him
63:45
oh in front of people they'll raise the
63:47
dead and heal the sick and say you can
63:49
still be a witch
63:51
see this thing is coming we have to be
63:54
powerful we have to be strong
63:56
we have to be fierce we have to
63:58
understand uh it says in all your
64:00
getting of wisdom get
64:01
understanding that is knowledge of the
64:03
holy one
64:04
and how he operates that's why these
64:07
days
64:08
have to come they have to have
64:11
manifestations of the power
64:13
and the passion and the plans of the
64:15
living god
64:18
because that is the one thing we can
64:20
come against it with
64:22
because there will be a lot of
64:23
impressionable people think oh this is a
64:25
good thing they have not
64:26
one ounce of discernment in their being
64:30
because they've been fed it by movies
64:34
and books oh there are good witches
64:37
they're
64:37
against the bad ones there are no good
64:40
witches
64:46
and they've been around for a long time
64:50
and the bible says have nothing to do
64:52
with a necromancer
64:54
go look it up
64:58
there were never any good ones in the
64:59
old testament there were never any good
65:01
ones in the new testament and there are
65:02
no good ones now
65:05
don't consult a medium or a psychic
65:08
you're getting this for free don't
65:10
consult them if you did
65:11
lose it from your song repent for it
65:15
they don't work for god
65:19
he's fivefold ministry his prophets
65:22
or prophetic people anyone can prophesy
65:27
make sure you're accountable in your
65:28
life and your actions right and you know
65:30
how you get more you step out and do it
65:33
you step out god gives you word if he's
65:35
like you're going to explode and burn
65:36
inside
65:38
you need to say that you're also not
65:40
accountable for forcing that person to
65:42
do it
65:43
i'll save you some grief if you deliver
65:45
a word from god it's not your job to
65:47
make them do it
65:49
you're going to start a whole different
65:51
war
65:53
you deliver it let the holy spirit work
65:56
on them
65:57
not your job
66:02
and the hardest people to prophesy to
66:04
are your family
66:08
my family still wants to know what's for
66:10
dinner when laundry's gonna be done
66:14
even though they have they have all this
66:16
revelation
66:19
he knows how to keep you humble give
66:22
your family
66:22
[Laughter]
66:26
and even if i go too long let me know i
66:28
just
66:30
gotta talk about jesus
66:33
bless the lord jesus christ and all that
66:36
he's done
66:37
more than any of us all put together
66:39
he's been through it all
66:43
he really has the hardest part was the
66:47
garden
66:47
not the cross he died before he got
66:50
there
66:52
he died to the father's will
66:56
if it be possible let this cup pass from
66:59
me
67:01
because what was in the cup wasn't in
67:03
him
67:04
it wasn't anything he ever would do or
67:06
want to do
67:07
but what had to be nailed to the cross
67:09
was what was in the cup
67:12
that's the only person who can forgive
67:14
our sins is him
67:15
he's the only one that drank all that
67:17
sin in
67:18
and nailed it to the cross no one else
67:21
can say they can forgive sins
67:23
no other religion no other god none of
67:26
them
67:28
in the garden was the most important
67:30
thing he did
67:32
when he said but not my will
67:35
let your will be done and two angels
67:39
were sent from heaven
67:41
i got to talk about this cup when jesus
67:44
when he was on the earth and it would
67:46
say
67:46
even when he had his disciples
67:47
especially after he got the disciples
67:50
he'd go away to the mountain to be with
67:51
his father
67:54
he'd go see him he'd meet him and talk
67:56
to him
67:57
and he went there and he took him a cup
68:01
god his father made him a carpenter
68:04
he put business in his son so he would
68:07
have a door to speak to anybody anywhere
68:11
that's why he likes business people you
68:14
get more invitations if your business
68:16
right and so i also opened a door for
68:19
him to talk with sinners all the time
68:20
they wanted him to do he was a master
68:22
carpenter not just a finish not just a
68:24
little finish she was a master carpenter
68:26
joseph was a master carpenter so he made
68:29
on purpose
68:30
for his father he made this cup
68:34
it wasn't really beautiful it was wood
68:36
of course
68:37
very perfect mastery the way he made it
68:40
in the handle was
68:40
beautiful and so he met with him and
68:43
gave it to him
68:44
this is about his um second year into
68:47
his ministry
68:49
so when the father had to choose he
68:51
already knew this would all happen
68:53
he had to choose a cup to put all that
68:56
in
68:56
and he knew his son would have to drink
68:58
it or the plan wouldn't work
69:01
the plan was to for him to die for our
69:04
sins that we might be free that we would
69:06
have a way back to the father
69:08
so the father got that cup and he put
69:10
all that stuff in it
69:11
he chose two angels
69:14
from a gabriel's group because gabriel
69:16
angels look more like humans with wings
69:18
most of the army look like creatures
69:23
i mean some have eight eyes
69:26
some have weapons coming out of them
69:29
they're an army
69:31
so he picked two of gabriel's that
69:34
already the lord knew who these angels
69:36
were he knew them he knew them when he
69:38
was in heaven
69:39
and they brought that cup to him and
69:41
they were in the garden
69:42
the whole time and ministered to him
69:44
while he was having to drink this cup
69:48
but as part of their reward god does
69:51
reward
69:53
as part of the reward for willing to do
69:55
that it would be very hard because they
69:56
couldn't come against anybody there who
69:58
was coming to take him
70:00
the army actually probably had the
70:02
hardest time because he was the lord of
70:04
hosts
70:05
the army of heaven he was over all the
70:06
armies of heaven christ was
70:09
and and they loved him and so it was
70:12
probably very hard they were all told in
70:14
heaven this was going to happen they
70:15
knew it
70:16
so they didn't come down and beat up
70:17
people or rip up the people that were
70:18
going to try to crucify him
70:20
i'm sure they wanted to do that because
70:23
to defend to protect him would have been
70:24
their number one thing
70:25
when christ came and was sent down to
70:28
earth and
70:28
made into a little seed and planted in
70:30
the womb of mary
70:32
they already knew they couldn't go down
70:33
there and fight for him
70:36
if you remember what he said before the
70:37
sanhedrin court
70:39
if i wanted to do you remember he said
70:42
that
70:43
if i wanted to he was letting them know
70:46
i'm not
70:47
i'm not who you really think i am i have
70:49
the ability to do these things i lay
70:51
down my life but if i wanted to
70:53
i could call the army of heaven these
70:56
creatures are like 150 200 feet high
70:58
they have eyes where you wouldn't even
71:00
think guys would be
71:01
they have spears coming out that shred
71:03
the enemy when they spin
71:06
the the in satan's army they they have
71:08
all kinds of weapons they turn into
71:10
missiles and go to where the battle is
71:11
and they come back to be their self and
71:13
then they go in there and attack
71:15
he could have called them
71:19
to fight for him if he had said even one
71:21
word they would have come
71:23
but he knew he had to die
71:27
so these two angels were in the garden
71:29
with him their reward was
71:31
they also were chosen to be in the tomb
71:33
with him
71:34
and they were the first ones to see him
71:37
when he came back up from health
71:41
i was recently in israel they're still
71:43
outside the tomb they still protect it's
71:45
a holy place
71:46
they're still there they're on
71:48
assignment
71:50
they were the first ones who got to see
71:52
him they're also the ones that talked to
71:53
the disciples they talked to mary
71:55
and they said why are you looking for
71:57
the why are you looking for him
71:59
he's not dead those two same angels were
72:02
the ones who were in the garden with him
72:03
with a cup so god does give rewards
72:07
angels get rewards for completing what
72:10
they were sent for
72:11
now in this time they are
72:14
millions of them have been sent to fight
72:16
on our behalf
72:18
we have the right to command them
72:20
because they were made
72:22
like a military and you can't go to an
72:25
army a natural army and say
72:27
would you mind please going over here
72:29
and doing that
72:32
could you imagine standing before hope
72:34
or gay going to ship them out somewhere
72:36
would you mind would it bother you uh
72:39
please i have a request would you mind
72:40
going over that they would look at you
72:42
like you were nuts
72:43
the army of heaven is the same way
72:46
they need orders from headquarters
72:50
well headquarters is here because the
72:52
lord of hosts lives
72:54
in us
73:00
and they have been very very busy over
73:04
these last
73:05
few months and even more so
73:08
now to make sure every single thing gets
73:11
exposed
73:13
they know where everything is
73:16
nothing is hidden from god he knows
73:18
where every stolen ballot is
73:20
he knows where every every machine it
73:22
was messed with or tampered with or
73:23
changed or whatever
73:24
he knows the name of every person who
73:26
participated
73:29
he is not clueless
73:32
and he meant it when he said the
73:34
exposure will be great
73:36
so he said i said well what do you want
73:38
me to do now i mean i i pray every night
73:40
i'm not
73:41
i call it prayer communication
73:44
i talk to god if i have a request i
73:48
spend another time
73:50
just getting to know him i would just
73:52
spend time talking to him like he was
73:54
right here because he is
73:57
and one day he walked through the wall
73:58
of my home now he walks through the wall
74:00
of my home all the time
74:03
but they need you need to give them
74:05
commands
74:07
they can't take a written prayer request
74:09
okay they can't do that
74:13
back in the day even in the old
74:14
testament i think it's in isaiah
74:16
it said that the israel was under a
74:19
siege for something i remember what it
74:20
was
74:21
and it said the captain of the host
74:23
that's michael
74:25
went to the far ends of heaven and
74:27
gathered the army of heaven to come and
74:28
fight on behalf of israel
74:31
so that's the way it normally was done
74:33
until 2014
74:37
there was already a major shift into our
74:40
authority and dominion
74:42
and i can tell you this the army of
74:43
heaven cannot they cannot finish the
74:46
whole purpose he made them
74:47
if we do not do this they were always
74:51
designed to fight
74:52
for us amen
74:58
i just want to assure you that trump i
75:01
hear my
75:02
in my ears all the time trump's winning
75:04
trump's winning
75:05
he's sitting in the white house he's
75:06
going to sit in that white house he's
75:07
not going to be evicted
75:11
he will sit there and you'll begin even
75:13
more and more to see him
75:14
bring pension on different things
75:17
because he'll be preparing him
75:21
he will be preparing him to be president
75:23
after him
75:24
how do i know god said so
75:27
i say what god says and i show you
75:31
things that he
75:31
showed me and he will sit in that white
75:35
house
75:36
and to me it doesn't matter what date
75:38
they give that
75:39
it is happening it's happening i've even
75:42
already received a
75:44
request to come and do um to pray for
75:47
the president vice president at the
75:48
inaugural prayer breakfast because guess
75:50
what they're carrying on with their
75:51
plans too
75:54
[Applause]
75:57
they're preparing like none of this ever
76:01
happened
76:03
they're already scheduling events for
76:04
the inauguration
76:06
making plans hiring companies to do
76:09
things
76:11
because they know the truth
76:16
is everybody stand up for just a minute
76:23
you don't have to wonder if you've ever
76:24
been chosen if you're alive this is what
76:26
caused it if you're alive and breathing
76:28
you're chosen
76:31
if you remember the body of christ you
76:33
have greatness written all over you
76:37
god's plans have already been written
76:40
about you
76:42
and god said these days that we're
76:44
living now
76:45
will be sung about in heaven in eternity
76:50
this so this is not just another time
76:54
on the earth this is an event on god's
76:57
timeline
76:58
it doesn't count time like we do it's
77:01
all about
77:02
events and this is an event in heaven
77:07
part of the divine decade that we'll be
77:09
living in
77:11
and the things you'll get to do people
77:13
have never even seen or heard of on the
77:15
earth before
77:18
because you're chosen
77:21
nobody can tell you you're not i'm
77:23
telling you you are chosen
77:26
how do i know you're here
77:30
if he times your birth on the earth and
77:33
you are here you are chosen
77:36
chosen to be great for him chosen to
77:39
manifest the power
77:41
of the living god
77:45
it is a great thing to be a manifested
77:47
son or daughter
77:49
he trusts you you don't have to have a
77:52
real high education it's not about how
77:54
smart you are
77:54
it's about how willing
77:58
pray that my people be willing in the
78:00
day of my power
78:05
those who are willing and obedient shall
78:06
eat the fat of the
78:09
i know the word i don't carry a bible
78:13
it's in here we were taught
78:17
to read the word of god and know the
78:19
word of god we were taught to pray
78:21
before we could even speak we had family
78:24
altar
78:28
but it didn't make me not want god it
78:31
made me want him more
78:34
he loves every person in every
78:38
country no matter where they are right
78:40
now no matter who they are
78:42
no matter what they're doing
78:45
he still wants them
78:48
so if he doesn't have us if he doesn't
78:52
have the light
78:54
in the spirit realm you have light
78:56
coming from you some people have great
78:58
light some people have light
79:00
some people have darkness in them
79:02
[Music]
79:05
so i always know who knows the lord and
79:08
he doesn't know the lord
79:12
if there's any way possible now these
79:15
people have to shake their hand they
79:16
don't know they don't want me hugging
79:17
well some might want to
79:18
hang them it's so important
79:22
to learn to release the anointing
79:25
if you don't if you don't do that why
79:26
did he put it in you to release it
79:29
[Music]
79:30
you only got to deposit
79:32
[Music]
79:33
it says in first john 2 27 when you
79:35
receive jesus christ as your savior
79:38
you receive a deposit of the anointing
79:43
what anointing the anointing breaks the
79:46
yoke
79:47
that's what it is the more you release
79:49
it
79:50
the more it grows that was not peter's
79:53
personal
79:53
shadow that healed people it was the
79:56
cloud of anointing
79:58
because he released so much it builds a
80:00
cloud sometimes you can walk in the room
80:02
and it fills the whole room
80:04
that's any believer any believer
80:08
you have it in you it's a deposit
80:12
so the more you give it out the more you
80:14
get back
80:16
and it never stops it just grows and
80:18
grows and
80:19
one day you feel yourself when you go i
80:21
release the anointing you actually feel
80:23
it it looks like blue fire
80:26
shooting out of you so everybody put
80:28
your hand here we're gonna stir it up
80:32
say father i choose as an act of my will
80:38
as a believer in jesus christ
80:42
to release the anointing so stir it up
80:48
okay now i want you to lay hands on
80:49
somebody next to you and i want you to
80:52
say
80:52
with everything within you and you say
80:54
this and you wait until i say
80:56
i can feel i can feel leaving you i want
80:59
you to open your hand the person say i
81:00
release
81:01
the anointing in jesus name
81:06
i want you to see i can already feel it
81:08
i want you to picture it
81:10
leaving right here and it goes up your
81:12
arm like blue fire
81:14
written out of your arm so if i walk
81:16
here
81:18
like i can feel it coming from all of
81:22
you
81:23
it's like up here it swirls like a river
81:26
the fire does everywhere
81:32
i've been i feel it like waves hitting
81:34
me right now
81:36
it's very powerful i want you to say
81:40
thank you jesus
81:42
for giving me the anointing
81:46
encourage me every day
81:50
to use it wherever i go
81:54
amen okay y'all stop
81:58
[Music]
82:00
[Applause]
82:03
when i sit in a restaurant i always put
82:05
my hand on the table and just say
82:07
i release the anointing and i will see
82:10
blue fire
82:11
come out of my hand and coat that whole
82:13
table it will never
82:15
wash off it will never wear off
82:18
whoever sits at that table will get the
82:22
anointing on them i do the same thing to
82:24
the glasses to the silverware
82:26
when you go through a door if you touch
82:28
the door release the anointing when you
82:30
slide your card release the anointing
82:32
everyone who slides their card in that
82:34
thing will get the anointing on them
82:38
before you send a text get it typed out
82:40
let your hand say release the anointing
82:42
when they open it the anointing will get
82:43
on them
82:44
[Music]
82:47
it is transferable
82:50
there's no excuse not to do it it is
82:54
free
82:58
you will begin really i'm not kidding
83:00
you'll sit in the seat and get up and
83:01
someone sits and they'll feel the
83:02
anointing
83:04
i can sit and people people's seats like
83:06
when we used to do i used to do
83:07
hospitality of our church of 5000.
83:10
we would do the feed the board every
83:13
once a year it would be like jesse and
83:15
all kinds i can't remember other names
83:17
right now but powerful men
83:19
and women of god and they get up and
83:21
leave i wouldn't be in there when they
83:22
were eating i go sit in everybody's
83:23
chair i knew who it was i always knew
83:25
jesse i'd start laughing
83:28
whoever was i i could feel it
83:31
it's like light electricity on you
83:36
if you want to have encounters
83:40
if you want to feel the power of god
83:44
it is in you
83:47
it's already in you when you got saved
83:51
he put it there
83:53
you release it you can put on clothing
83:55
like i prayed over their mantles
83:57
like i release the anointing every chair
84:00
in your office including your desk now
84:02
has the anointing in it
84:04
it doesn't matter where you go the more
84:06
you do it the more will come out
84:08
and you do that one day you'll be
84:09
shocked and you'll feel it leaving you
84:12
so when peter would walk past people we
84:14
did it so much the cloud of the
84:15
anointing
84:16
like far exceeded him and when they said
84:19
his shadow touched him they were healed
84:21
and demons came out
84:22
it was the anointing that breaks the
84:24
yoke that you
84:25
have don't ever forget this
84:30
you have a weapon from heaven
84:33
that breaks the yoke of darkness
84:36
put in every gift you give every gift
84:40
you give release
84:41
into the gift if you give something away
84:43
people release it if you give food to
84:44
people release it
84:46
don't ever stop doing that one day
84:49
you walk into a place and people will
84:52
fall out from the anointing
84:54
the glory you create glory for god but
84:57
you also carry the glory
84:59
how do i know christ in you
85:02
do you know what that means that's
85:06
something that's deposited in you too
85:09
the glory at one point will begin to be
85:12
released from you it looks like
85:14
it looks like shock waves of light the
85:16
glory looks like light the fire looks
85:18
like fire
85:20
it feels like i when i see people
85:22
release it it
85:23
like shock waves i can almost hear it
85:26
and it was somewhere
85:26
speaking somewhere and the holy spirit
85:28
said go back to the products table
85:31
and as i started walk through the proxy
85:32
table people started falling out
85:34
now i talked about the glory in the
85:35
meaning guess what it also makes a
85:38
difference because of your soul
85:41
that when you speak about these things
85:42
it increases in your soul
85:46
you can't hear something and then do
85:47
nothing
85:49
you can't do it heaven doesn't operate
85:51
that way it's your actions
85:53
along with your words if you want to
85:57
rule you have to do something
86:02
who cares what people think
86:06
so i went to the broader table these
86:07
people started falling out and i'm like
86:08
i could feel
86:09
like wow i could hardly i could hardly
86:11
stand up on wow god
86:14
they're really anointed aren't they
86:17
i heard the holy spirit he laughs at me
86:19
a lot
86:20
he was laughing and laughing goes that
86:24
is coming from you because i was looking
86:27
no matter what these people are falling
86:29
down they're
86:29
lining people waiting to get products
86:31
and my son-in-law who's my son-in-law
86:34
just kept right on selling the products
86:36
i'll always decide now just
86:38
do this it was funny because okay okay
86:42
what do i do you said just say already
86:43
used to glory
86:44
and i literally could see light waves go
86:46
like shhh
86:50
and whoever they touched they started
86:52
falling down people got healed people
86:53
got set free and went
86:56
what is this when the bible goes the
86:58
knowledge
87:00
of the glory will cover the earth life
87:02
the waters cover the sea
87:04
he said it will cover them because you
87:06
will be releasing it people will be this
87:08
not just me
87:09
this is for the body of christ christ in
87:13
you
87:13
is the hope of glory the glory being
87:16
released showing up
87:17
impacting people and nations and things
87:20
and places that god wants you to go to
87:23
this is what you get as a believer
87:27
do it in your family's home how do you
87:29
do that you just start doing it
87:30
i release the glory i release the glory
87:34
i release the glory just take time to do
87:36
it pretty soon you can do that one day
87:38
and you'll feel it coming out of you
87:41
if you speak for christ if you share
87:43
with people
87:44
if you read your word it's building in
87:48
you
87:49
let it out let the anointing out let the
87:54
glory out
87:55
fire when the baptism in fire comes it's
87:58
going to be so
87:59
powerful it just burns the world
88:02
out of you it burns any fear you'll
88:04
never be afraid again the boldness that
88:07
rises up in you
88:08
you begin to carry that fire places will
88:11
actually look like they're on fire
88:13
buildings look like they're on fire
88:15
people will see it on you one day
88:17
his eyes were flames of fire
88:20
our god is a consuming fire that is
88:24
spiritual fire
88:26
that will transform you and places and
88:28
people
88:29
because you carry it

but i don't know how much you heard or i
00:18
don't know but we're going to start all
00:19
over again so thank you for joining us
00:21
i'm very excited that i get to share um
00:24
revelation from heaven
00:26
you're going to get news bulletins from
00:28
heaven during this time you may even get
00:29
something
00:30
brand new given to me and if it comes
00:32
from heaven i'm going to share it
00:34
but this is the very main purpose for
00:37
these this broadcast today
00:39
is to share what time it actually is on
00:42
god's timeline
00:44
and many people don't know god has a
00:46
timeline of course he does he created
00:48
time
00:49
and there are certain things he will
00:51
make sure
00:52
happen in this earth he made the earth
00:55
he made us he put us here for a purpose
00:57
and so guess what he has worked out this
00:59
whole timeline thing
01:01
even to the very end which by the way no
01:04
matter what people say or think
01:06
or try to calculate or assume
01:10
only one person knows when the end will
01:13
actually come
01:15
that would be the father so even jesus
01:18
knows that right so we're going to flow
01:20
with what the father has figured out for
01:22
this time
01:23
and he does have a plan even while
01:25
you're taking
01:26
a unexpected vacay at home
01:30
and i'm praying all the time for people
01:32
you know and in their situations and how
01:34
this is going to affect them in many
01:36
different ways
01:37
i have been outside at night in the
01:38
street probably for hours
01:41
praying over all of you and i want to
01:44
say
01:44
hi to my friends that would be my pastor
01:46
friends who've invited me to come and
01:48
share
01:48
their place to bring heaven to this
01:51
earth i'm excited that some of you
01:53
actually get to see
01:54
this broadcast and from now on as much
01:56
as we can we're going to give you all a
01:57
heads up
01:58
if you would like to before we go live
02:01
and then
02:02
i'm very happy to be with all of you
02:05
today and very grateful for all that you
02:07
have done
02:08
and paid a price for yourself to allow
02:10
god to invade and
02:12
inhabit your sanctuaries in your meeting
02:14
places
02:15
because you want the more of god and i
02:17
hope everyone out there
02:19
you have had an opportunity to be a part
02:21
of meetings
02:23
that give you revelation that train you
02:26
that they don't just give you a nice
02:27
little message that makes you feel warm
02:29
and fuzzy
02:29
but will make you powerful and dangerous
02:32
against the darkness
02:34
that's why we are here it's the body of
02:36
christ
02:37
that is the audience i'm speaking to
02:38
right now
02:40
to those who have been born again who've
02:42
received jesus christ as your savior
02:44
those are the ones i'm speaking to
02:46
anyone else listening
02:47
you're just going to get blessed anyway
02:49
and by the way i need to let you know
02:50
that my words carry the anointing that
02:52
abides in me
02:54
the anointing that breaks the yoke of
02:56
darkness so if you're out there for
02:57
other purposes or uh you have an agenda
03:00
of your own
03:01
zap bam you with the anointing so that
03:04
when you leave this
03:06
broadcast no matter what you thought you
03:08
came here for
03:09
you will be filled with the anointing
03:11
aren't you excited about that
03:13
we need to learn about these weapons god
03:15
has given us like the anointing i may
03:17
share a little bit about that later
03:19
by the way this is not the only
03:20
broadcast that we'll be making
03:22
during our little vacay at home stay
03:26
whatever we want to call that i don't
03:28
like the word quarantine
03:30
we don't actually have anything ourself
03:32
right now and let me tell you we
03:34
you will learn how to come against
03:37
every spirit of infirmity sickness or
03:40
disease
03:41
before we end because most of the
03:43
questions i get from people are
03:45
what do we do about this can we do
03:47
anything about this you know we're not
03:49
over sickness
03:50
what can we do well they obviously don't
03:52
read the word of god
03:53
because jesus said the things that he
03:55
did
03:56
we will do also in greater works and he
03:59
was
04:00
over sickness he was not under it you
04:02
are over it you are not
04:03
under it you need to start saying that
04:06
yourself don't repeat every
04:07
every doom and gloom thing you hear
04:09
about today or you know this is the end
04:12
we need to get ready to escape on the
04:13
rapture rug
04:15
i can tell you also this is not time for
04:17
your rapture rug roll it up and stick it
04:19
in the closet
04:20
and as you've heard me say before get
04:22
your crown on
04:23
because the word itself says that we are
04:25
kings and priests and to our god
04:28
those are spiritual levels of authority
04:31
and dominion
04:32
that is something powerful christ gave
04:34
us you need to learn to rule
04:37
even in this time even while you're at
04:39
home or wherever you are right now
04:41
you know that you can speak words of
04:43
authority and dominion and
04:45
take that authority and it starts to
04:47
change things
04:48
number one open your front door if
04:50
there's a lot of arguing going on
04:52
if there's strife in your home right now
04:55
open your front door and you evict it
04:56
out right now you don't want to keep
04:58
that stuff in your home
04:59
make sure you're speaking words of hope
05:01
and life and truth to all of your family
05:04
and even to yourself so these are just
05:07
little
05:07
tips maybe the holy spirit may add
05:10
throughout this broadcast because he
05:11
really is
05:12
the director no matter who we think we
05:14
are what we're doing
05:16
the holy spirit is the director of all
05:17
these broadcasts if he wants something
05:20
sad that's not on my little tiny tip
05:22
list here then he's going to say it to
05:25
me and if he says it you're going to
05:26
hear
05:26
it that's one of those news news
05:29
bulletins from heaven
05:31
but our primary purpose today is to
05:34
discuss
05:34
what time it is on god's timeline so
05:37
that you be prepared
05:38
for the future and by the way the main
05:40
thing he wants me to say to you is this
05:42
is a
05:43
temporary situation some people act like
05:46
it is the end of their life and it's
05:49
not this is only temporary it will
05:53
pass like many things that come and go
05:55
on this earth
05:56
this too will pass and hopefully you
06:00
will be stronger and better
06:02
and more understanding of god himself
06:05
and be able
06:06
to ruin reign in your own home learn how
06:08
to crush the darkness and push it back
06:11
so you will be stronger yourself and i
06:13
want to also just
06:14
add this i have called many different
06:16
places where i do business with
06:18
or a frequent and most of them have left
06:21
the nicest
06:23
kindest and encouraging messages on
06:25
their answer machine
06:27
for everyone to hear when you call just
06:28
as an example
06:30
i had to call steinmart because i have
06:33
to know if i can still come in and make
06:34
my little payment
06:35
and guess what they said they said this
06:38
is just a temporary setback we
06:41
will be back and when we come back we'll
06:43
be stronger we can't wait to see you
06:45
again
06:45
that should be your attitude not like
06:48
it's all over oh god what are we gonna
06:50
do now
06:50
do we need to take all of our money out
06:52
of the bank and go hide somewhere in the
06:54
hills with it number one you can't spend
06:56
it in the hills
06:57
and number two i would not do that
06:59
unless god told you to
07:00
you're gonna need that bank account
07:01
you're going to need it to still thrive
07:04
and not just survive on this surge
07:06
you're going to need a place to keep
07:07
your money send your money and spend it
07:09
and so unless he told you that don't run
07:11
to the bank and drain your bank account
07:13
and close everything
07:14
he'll just be going back and reopening
07:16
it later
07:17
this is a temporary situation
07:21
and i do take everything seriously
07:23
people said you should be serious about
07:24
this is really a desperate time
07:26
i would not call this a desperate time i
07:28
would call this god's time
07:30
and i'm going to go along with what god
07:32
says and what god wants
07:33
and i'm going to keep my attitude
07:36
excited
07:37
and expectant because that's what you
07:39
should be if you belong to him he knows
07:41
where you are
07:42
he knows every hair on your head he
07:44
knows every day of your life
07:45
he knows the day your mansion and your
07:47
mention in heaven will be done
07:49
he's already planned your homecoming so
07:52
why not stay excited in your life and
07:54
you
07:54
choose to be happy instead of mad angry
07:58
upset don't let that get into you
08:01
and whatever you do you need to crush
08:02
fear don't let fear rule you
08:05
no fear no interfering of fear in your
08:07
life
08:08
and why i keep saying that because a lot
08:10
of people are also
08:11
i get listen i get text messages from
08:13
people who actually have my number
08:15
i get emails from all over the world i
08:18
get phone messages left on our phones
08:20
which we have
08:21
obviously on our website that anybody
08:23
can call us that wants to
08:25
and so after listening to these or
08:27
looking at these
08:28
over these last few days i understand
08:32
that people
08:32
are in fear they're confused they're in
08:36
fear maybe they've never faced anything
08:38
like this before
08:39
my mom would be sitting right here with
08:41
her plum switch next to me saying hey
08:43
they survived the depression
08:45
this is not the depression it is not a
08:48
plague
08:49
and it isn't a disease it is a virus
08:53
a virus comes and goes it also has a
08:56
time limit
08:57
and why have we chosen the symbol for
08:59
our theme
09:00
that says god's time and it shows an
09:03
hourglass like an
09:04
actual hourglass because the sands of
09:07
time
09:08
in an hourglass have a limit
09:11
and when those sands pass through the
09:13
hourglass
09:14
that time is over well that's exactly
09:17
how we see this whole situation
09:19
it is a temporary time it is a limited
09:22
time in your life
09:24
and i look at this times break in time
09:27
or moment in time that we're in right
09:29
now
09:30
is very special that means i get to
09:32
spend more private time with god i
09:34
actually will get to spend time with my
09:36
family
09:38
now that's exciting for me since i do so
09:40
much traveling
09:42
and i do a lot of broadcast i do a lot
09:44
of other things
09:45
that takes up the time on the earth in
09:47
my life so i'm
09:49
in one in one way i'm very grateful and
09:51
thankful
09:52
that i actually get to spend time with
09:54
my family or maybe even call
09:55
the family members i haven't seen in a
09:57
while i hope you're going to take
09:59
advantage of that
10:00
maybe even make a few notes of wow i can
10:03
spend time doing
10:04
this instead of just being a fearful or
10:07
upset
10:08
or confused get rid of all those things
10:11
in your life right now
10:13
and fill yourself with the life of god
10:15
the plans of god
10:16
his expectancy you can choose with your
10:19
own will
10:21
to take this in one direction or another
10:24
i hope you take it in one that takes you
10:27
up
10:28
and not down in this time god has
10:31
planned on the earth
10:32
he's not changing anything it's not
10:34
going to change his plans
10:35
or what he's going to do just because a
10:37
virus is passing through
10:39
and hopefully will pass out that would
10:41
be i say rather than passing the virus
10:43
just pass out
10:44
and i want to also repeat something
10:46
you're going to things i've heard god
10:47
say to me
10:48
and he this is what he says about this
10:50
whole thing this is not
10:52
a government takeover but it is a
10:55
takedown of the virus so doesn't that
10:58
sound much better than people yelling
11:00
the the government's taking over they're
11:02
going to take everything away we're
11:03
going to have marshall
11:04
uh law is going to come in and we're
11:06
going to be be putting body bags and
11:08
ships somewhere yes we've heard all
11:10
these things given to us
11:11
that is not what god's got planned and
11:14
don't let your mind go in that direction
11:16
okay
11:17
we need to all be in agreement with what
11:19
has been decided
11:20
on for our best our government that is
11:24
in place right now
11:26
number one god chose our leader he's a
11:29
powerful man
11:30
he does love america and he's doing his
11:33
very best to handle this in the best
11:35
way and to think that anybody would even
11:38
consider
11:38
that possibly the country would work
11:40
together to try
11:42
to limit the spread of this uh virus
11:46
and really care about us and he is
11:48
talking about financial help i am not
11:51
um crazy enough to think that that
11:53
doesn't interfere in your life i
11:55
understand
11:56
we have to have money to buy things and
11:58
to get supplies that we need
12:00
and my prayer for all of you out there
12:03
is that god will
12:04
so inspire you feel you so full of him
12:07
make sure you think about others other
12:09
than just yourself because i know right
12:11
now
12:12
some people are kind of isolated with
12:13
themselves but you do remember that
12:16
all the people in this country are also
12:20
experiencing the same thing
12:22
at the same time which is rare okay
12:25
there's people in other countries and
12:27
many of them are my friends
12:28
and i want to say hello to everybody out
12:30
there who's not in america
12:32
yes god cares about you too make sure
12:35
you're speaking
12:36
life and hope and the power of god and
12:38
everything you say if people ask you
12:40
questions about this going on
12:42
say we hope in our god we trust in our
12:45
god
12:46
our god knows and he cares about us and
12:48
he cares about people other people too
12:51
so the way you think and the what you
12:53
say
12:54
makes a huge difference in the
12:56
atmosphere of where you live
12:59
this place i live in right here i call
13:01
it my dwelling place because it's not a
13:03
home it's my office this
13:05
whole entire structure we used to call a
13:07
home is now our
13:09
office and i mean it's our studios it's
13:11
our
13:12
shipping receiving department it's a
13:14
duplicating place
13:15
and we have learned to adapt to that but
13:18
god has a plan even in doing this this
13:20
wasn't something negative he planned for
13:22
us
13:22
we had to adapt our own lives we do know
13:25
at one point in our life we will get
13:27
another home and i will so enjoy that
13:29
personal space and private place but
13:31
right now we're giving this place almost
13:33
to the whole world
13:34
so you will know who he is why he sent
13:37
you to this earth
13:38
what his plans are for you and we on
13:42
purpose on the hourglass took the h
13:44
off of the word it's not hourglass
13:47
h-o-u-r
13:50
o-u-r it's o-u-r
13:54
it's our time with god's time it's us
13:58
doing something together
13:59
and one of the other things that we'll
14:01
be talking about maybe not tonight are
14:02
the keys to the kingdom
14:04
and they they are so powerfully amazing
14:06
christ gave us so many things to
14:08
live with to make our life better if we
14:12
apply it
14:13
and that's another major thing for you
14:15
when you get revelation from god
14:17
it is not ever something just to hear
14:19
it's something to live by
14:22
and there are tips on how we can do that
14:24
in the earth
14:25
and make sure no matter what every day
14:27
when you get up you ask for
14:28
grace for abundant life it's free
14:32
it's from god it will fill you with fuel
14:35
from heaven
14:36
so i'm going to encourage everybody out
14:37
there listening let's just do this
14:38
together right now because like i said
14:41
i'm here to explain and train so i'm
14:42
going to train anyone out there
14:44
if you've not learned about asking for
14:46
grace for abundant life there's two
14:48
graces
14:49
one is grace for eternal life that
14:52
christ brings us
14:53
the other one is grace for abundant life
14:56
that even
14:57
christ operated in it says in the word
14:59
that as a child
15:01
god this is the father filled his son
15:03
with
15:04
his grace that was grace for abundant
15:07
life it's one of the reasons why christ
15:08
was able to be happy
15:10
and successful uh living downhill with
15:13
mankind
15:14
when he used to live in heaven with his
15:16
father and then all of a sudden here he
15:17
is on the earth walking just like you
15:19
and i
15:20
facing everything we did but he didn't
15:22
sin how about that
15:23
so don't let people tell you you cannot
15:25
live sin free yes
15:27
you can you choose
15:30
but in this time we're going to ask for
15:32
lord anybody hold your hands out
15:34
if you're watching right now and repeat
15:36
these words
15:38
father i
15:41
ask for and receive
15:44
grace for this day for abundant
15:48
life amen
15:51
now i can tell you right now i feel it
15:53
coming into me
15:54
it's like a shower of a light
15:56
electricity
15:58
because i am a seer and uh you know i am
16:01
a revelator
16:02
i experience the things that go on in
16:04
the spirit realm
16:05
and that was fuel from heaven being
16:07
poured into me that i will need for this
16:09
day
16:10
and if you get that every day of your
16:12
life before you get out of your bed
16:13
it won't always be your selfish self
16:16
showing up
16:17
it'll be heaven showing up you'd be
16:19
surprised that just as few words that
16:21
you've asked for and received
16:23
will help to change what's in your soul
16:25
and joy will flood your soul
16:27
expectancy hope will flood your soul and
16:30
then you'll be coming out ready for that
16:32
day
16:33
and so i hope of all of you who did that
16:35
you don't never forget that
16:36
it'll be one of the greatest things that
16:38
i ever train you in
16:40
is is called heaven protocol for heaven
16:43
culture because i've been having many
16:45
times no one up there is upset
16:47
or angry or offended nobody's confused
16:50
nobody losing deception
16:52
there's no worry there's no anger or
16:54
wrath up there
16:55
they live in that abundant life grace so
16:58
when you ask for you get filled with
17:00
that
17:00
it changed me from the first time the
17:02
father taught me how to do that
17:04
it changed me it was so important to him
17:06
that he literally caught me up to heaven
17:08
before his very throne and taught me
17:11
that
17:11
like i was eight years old most of the
17:15
things god has in his word for us
17:17
are simple but we in our human mind
17:20
feel like we have to understand every
17:23
single thing
17:24
we reason it out we don't step forward
17:26
in faith we use reason instead of faith
17:29
faith is what draws heaven jesus
17:32
said himself when i do return to the
17:35
earth
17:35
will i find faith he didn't say
17:39
will i find divine wealth will i find uh
17:42
you know will i find
17:43
people laughing and celebrating what
17:46
will i find so one thing he wants to
17:48
know is will he find faith
17:50
faith is something that creates
17:53
for you is something that you can live
17:56
with and live in every day of your life
18:00
it is a source that you will even use
18:02
when you get to heaven
18:04
okay you get trained to do things in
18:06
heaven also
18:08
i won't even share some of those right
18:09
now because that's going to be our next
18:10
broadcast
18:11
but you know what faith is more
18:13
important than the food you eat or the
18:15
air you breathe
18:16
is faith it comes from heaven
18:19
god fills you with it the more you
18:22
operate in it it grows
18:24
until you become very powerful in the
18:26
spirit
18:27
and it's hard for the enemy to deceive
18:29
you these are simple basic
18:31
truths in the word of god and people
18:33
always tell me well not always some
18:35
people say you don't even have a bible
18:37
it's in here and it's very much
18:40
alive i was raised by my earthly father
18:44
who helped to take care of 15 of us how
18:47
would you like that
18:48
living here in florida we're in florida
18:50
i love florida
18:52
it doesn't snow you know we were from
18:54
upstate new york
18:55
we got frozen all the time we were the
18:58
chosen frozen back then but now we're
19:00
not
19:02
and so you need to learn the important
19:04
things in your life right now i know you
19:06
say well we need a house to live and of
19:07
course you do we need food to eat yes
19:09
and here to breathe
19:10
but even more important than those you
19:12
need faith in god
19:13
you need to be trusting him not just
19:16
when things are going well
19:17
but in the other times when things are
19:19
maybe a little bit challenging
19:21
or you're struggling with things even if
19:24
it's something that's not good in your
19:25
life you're struggling with it
19:26
god still loves you he wants you to step
19:30
out and use the faith everybody got a
19:33
measure of faith the bible says some
19:36
you need to learn to operate in it so it
19:38
will grow
19:39
and it will become productive and it
19:41
will change the way you live your life
19:44
in this day you're not supposed to be
19:46
living in
19:47
doom and gloom or hopelessness you
19:51
are supposed to shine like the stars in
19:55
the heavens
19:56
by the way we are over those stars we're
19:58
not even under those stars
20:00
all that god made whether here or
20:02
throughout the cosmos
20:04
he made that for us we are his offspring
20:07
he is our real father we came from him
20:11
you need to know about your dna you need
20:13
to know about the generations that went
20:15
before you
20:16
you need to know about the generations
20:17
that god even had in heaven
20:20
the ages that have passed down the earth
20:21
that you don't even know anything about
20:23
god holds that in his hand
20:27
if he wanted to right now he could sit
20:28
in heaven and hold the entire earth
20:31
in his hand or
20:35
he could become small enough to step
20:38
inside
20:38
you that's who he is
20:42
he knows everything everything that was
20:44
that is or ever will be
20:46
that's who you are trusting right now
20:48
with your life
20:49
in the midst of these challenging times
20:52
you need to trust him
20:53
and make sure you say that he loves to
20:56
hear you say i trust you
20:58
god i trust your father even when i
21:00
don't understand i am trusting you
21:02
i will serve no other god there will be
21:04
no other god before me and make sure by
21:06
the way you say that to satan
21:08
he hates to hear that by the way it
21:10
makes him tremble
21:11
in these days these few weeks we have of
21:14
being with our family and being with god
21:16
make sure you're productive in them
21:18
make sure you take full advantage of
21:20
them do fun things with your family
21:22
create and to be very creative and
21:24
inventive
21:25
and adventurous in this time with them
21:28
so they get hope
21:29
built in them and not fear
21:32
what you say what you say with your
21:34
mouth right now is very important
21:37
don't declare the doom and gloom don't
21:39
declare the time has come where
21:40
everything's
21:41
going to end when god just brought you
21:44
some of you have brand new babies in
21:46
your
21:46
life right now and children young
21:48
children did you know he has
21:49
generations of time planned for them too
21:54
don't make a decision in your head that
21:55
it's all over because then you'll be
21:57
running and hiding you might miss
21:58
something god has for you
22:00
these are great opportune times for god
22:02
to bring something new into your life
22:04
new jobs new homes new positions do you
22:07
know that's how he looks at
22:09
it we need to all be in agreement for
22:11
him to do what he wants
22:13
how about if we say god we want your
22:16
will your
22:17
way you all know that scripture that
22:20
talks about on earth as it is in heaven
22:22
that is his desire for all of us and i
22:25
know some of the prophets even pastors
22:27
and leaders
22:28
if they don't know what time it is you
22:30
know what they do they go to the end of
22:31
the bible
22:32
and they start speaking about the end
22:34
leaving out generations of time
22:36
for things that god has planned that
22:37
hasn't even happened yet on the earth
22:40
some of the best times have not even
22:42
happened yet i want to encourage you to
22:44
seek god on your own get the word and
22:46
stop reading it
22:47
there's even scripture in the word that
22:49
says jesus himself said
22:51
even though that nation will rise
22:52
against nation there'll be wars rumors
22:54
of wars nations will rise against nation
22:56
kingdoms shall rise against kingdom
22:58
guess what he says at the end of that
23:00
but the end is not yet
23:03
so i will tell you from heaven from god
23:06
himself
23:07
the end is not yet so roll up your
23:10
precious rapture rug
23:12
and stick it in your closet and maybe
23:14
get one that says
23:16
this is god's time and then live by that
23:19
time
23:20
yes i know things are different in your
23:22
life i know that they've said you can't
23:24
go to church
23:25
you can't do this nobody likes the word
23:27
can't but you know they actually have a
23:29
reason for doing that
23:31
like i said just a few minutes ago this
23:33
is not a this is not a government
23:35
takeover this is a
23:36
takedown of the virus
23:40
their purpose is to try to limit the
23:42
contact between
23:43
people so that anyone who has that will
23:46
not be able to spread it they're trying
23:47
to limit the spread
23:48
of the virus and you know even it has a
23:51
time it has a very limited time
23:54
that it even remains in your body it's a
23:56
virus remember it's not a disease
23:58
it's not a plague i think hell's about
24:01
to experience a plague though
24:02
it's called the faith of god in his
24:04
people that's like a plague to them
24:06
they don't like it they don't want to
24:08
hear that and uh so we're going to make
24:10
a lot of hell unhappy
24:12
a lot of hell's army is going to be very
24:14
unhappy because we'll be operating with
24:15
heaven's army
24:16
by the way they do exist also maybe we
24:19
should take
24:20
take seriously the things that god said
24:23
in his word
24:24
it is uh is a platform for life
24:28
and how to live it it even has a time
24:31
frame in itself but i can tell you you
24:34
are not in the end day
24:36
these are powerful days start thanking
24:39
god for the things that you desire in
24:41
your life
24:41
get your children teach them how to ask
24:44
for that grace do you know i have
24:45
grandchildren that learned it
24:47
when they were not even two years old
24:48
yet and now that they're six and seven
24:51
and eight if they start to have a
24:52
meltdown do you know what they do
24:53
they reach up and they say father i ask
24:55
for more grace
24:57
and their meltdown stops you know how
24:59
this could change the way your children
25:01
grow and live themselves this is a
25:04
powerful time to get to teach them
25:06
revelation that will even inform their
25:08
whole life their lifestyle and how they
25:10
live
25:11
don't run into the darkness don't
25:13
satisfy yourself with that
25:15
i know they're even saying you know your
25:17
entertainment can't take place why not
25:18
entertain yourselves for a while
25:20
i want to actually sit down and have
25:22
conversations with each other
25:25
i know there's still television out
25:27
there and there's not much on that eye
25:28
there is there
25:29
i am grateful to god that he is taking
25:31
hollywood which is one of the things
25:33
he's had me talk about
25:34
what does that mean that means he's
25:36
taking that throne away from satan see
25:38
he's got plans you maybe don't even know
25:40
about
25:40
he has big plans for this time god's
25:43
time
25:44
he calls it the kingdom age we're in a
25:47
new season
25:48
in this kingdom age there was the
25:50
introduction of the kingdom age and we
25:52
stepped off the platform into a new
25:54
spiritual time that never existed
25:56
you begin to hear new things that god
25:57
had planned and things that you are able
25:59
to do yourself
26:00
and now we're getting into the season
26:02
where we need to be activated and
26:04
literally start doing those things
26:06
i want to thank all those who who follow
26:09
this facebook live or the my youtube out
26:12
there
26:12
you get filled with revelation all the
26:14
time i hope you're applying that and you
26:16
know what don't just apply it make sure
26:17
you share it with others
26:19
these words are not my holy words these
26:22
are gods he's given a whole new way to
26:25
live
26:26
why not introduce a whole new culture on
26:27
the earth instead of trying to change
26:29
it's really hard to change a culture on
26:31
the earth
26:31
but why not introduce heaven's culture
26:34
why not have a habitation of heaven in
26:36
your home
26:37
and not the world i'm not saying you
26:40
have to throw
26:40
everything out there is some funny
26:43
things out there that are decent
26:45
uh there are different games you can get
26:46
and play or make up some of your own
26:48
with your family
26:50
i know my family was very creative
26:52
growing up uh we had a lot of drama
26:54
people in our lives
26:55
and we had a lot of leaders and i can
26:58
tell you the most challenging children
26:59
you have right now
27:01
are probably some of the most anointed
27:03
that's a tip
27:04
on letting you know that's why they are
27:07
like that
27:08
maybe they have a very powerful
27:09
personality you know they have a strong
27:12
will and they're so
27:13
you know why god likes people who are
27:14
strong-willed because when they learn
27:16
his
27:17
you can't change it you can't make them
27:20
stop it
27:21
god says that he likes strong-willed
27:22
people when he gets him on
27:24
the path he has nobody can pull them
27:27
off so maybe that will encourage some of
27:29
the parents out there
27:30
who are now doing 24-hour a day
27:32
homeschooling
27:34
or home living i bet your children are
27:37
excited about it they probably get to
27:38
see you more now than they ever have
27:40
before
27:41
and so like i said take advantage of
27:43
this time maybe have some cooking
27:45
classes with your children
27:47
they love to learn to do new things all
27:49
the time
27:50
my parents did that with us too that's
27:52
why i actually do know how to cook
27:54
and my sister jen who is here where are
27:56
you jen just say hello
28:00
i don't like her she gonna come say
28:02
hello
28:04

28:06
i have a whole team of people here
28:08
some of my family are part of what we do
28:11
but this is my baby sister we call her
28:13
number 15.
28:21
thank you for saying hi jen we got some
28:24
we have some fun things planned also
28:26
like we're gonna do j
28:28
and k in the kitchen i don't know when
28:30
we'll do that but hopefully maybe during
28:32
this next two weeks we'll be able to do
28:34
that
28:35
and we're actually have some cooking
28:36
classes for y'all
28:38
in our own kitchen now you know if i'm
28:40
doing it's going to be sweets i have a
28:42
sweet tooth blame it on
28:44
jesus jesus loved honeycomb
28:47
he lived on it all the time and i happen
28:50
to know that before the throne of god
28:52
people actually leave sweet treats for
28:54
him because he loves them
28:56
so we do have something a fun time in
28:58
the kitchen plan

29:02

29:48
who's over this whole
29:50
uh take now and the virus that they will
29:53
give
29:53
you give them great ideas on how to help
29:56
in finances or even delay payments on
29:58
things
29:59
i do want to let you know there are
30:01
actually already companies
30:02
you're right jenna need a drink
30:07
we've heard from companies that are
30:09
actually going to delay people's
30:10
payments if you have monthly payments
30:12
doing different places
30:13
planet fitness is one of those places if
30:16
you're ever
30:17
interested by the way i'm giving them a
30:18
free commercial i am a member of planet
30:20
fitness
30:21
i don't always agree with the videos
30:23
that they're showing you know on the
30:24
screens but they have great equipment
30:26
they have a great plan
30:28
some of it's very inexpensive and it's a
30:31
good way to get
30:32
in shape which the holy spirit has said
30:34
to us since we've been doing this heaven
30:36
thing
30:37
get in shape we have a long race to run
30:40
but planet fitness has already announced
30:42
because you know now they have to do all
30:43
their stuff online
30:45
and if you if you can sign up and watch
30:47
it online learn some new exercises and
30:49
stuff
30:49
but they've already announced that they
30:51
are not going to be charging
30:53
their monthly fees as long as this is
30:55
going on
30:56
and you're not able to use their gym
30:58
they're not going to charge you they're
30:59
going to withhold
31:00
your membership payments and i do know
31:02
that there are other companies out there
31:03
doing that and there are still
31:05
some a few restaurants open of course
31:08
two thumbs up for chick-fil-a
31:12
chick-fil-a that's a company that was
31:14
founded by god
31:16
and is a really promotes the gospel
31:19
if you work for chick-fil-a you are
31:21
blessed in this world
31:24
if you've never eaten a chick-fil-a
31:26
don't show up on sunday
31:29
because they will not be open they want
31:30
to make sure you get to go to church
31:32
we're going to talk about church in just
31:34
a minute but chick-fil-a is open
31:36
i think most of the ones that are is
31:38
probably drive-through
31:40
but there's even some that actually can
31:42
come to the door the restaurant they've
31:43
taken orders right there and then
31:44
filling them for you
31:46
they are actually getting witty ideas
31:48
instead of just closing it all down
31:50
because you know we can't meet in the
31:52
restaurants or meet out in other places
31:55
and i know you're missing a lot of your
31:56
special favorite things
31:58
do you know there's a thing called the
32:00
royal fast that god taught me a long
32:02
time ago the royal fast
32:04
is even harder than the daniel fast you
32:07
know to eat almost nothing is actually
32:08
harder than
32:09
giving up every one of your favorite
32:11
things
32:13
and you wouldn't believe it was unless
32:15
you tried it but on the royal fast
32:17
that's what he has me do off and on
32:19
you don't go to your favorite places you
32:21
don't even wear your favorite clothes
32:23

32:27
go and be with your friends who are your
32:28
favorite friends
32:30
you fast that and spend that time with
32:32
him so i like to look at this as part of
32:34
the royal fast
32:35
because you can't go to your sporting
32:37
events you can't go to your concerts
32:39
you know you can't go out to your
32:40
favorite eating places you can't meet
32:42
with all
32:42
your 20 or 50 friends you've got i pray
32:45
god you've got
32:46
friends and god if there are people out
32:47
there that don't have any send them
32:49
good friends who will lift up their life
32:53
and not crush them down
32:55
or held back you need friends in your
32:57
life you need people in your life who
32:59
are going to inspire and encourage you
33:01
especially to know god but there are
33:03
many places and even god i pray for
33:05
those who have their weddings planned
33:07
during this time
33:08
family reunions planned i know a lot of
33:11
things are getting interrupt
33:12
interrupted right now i just want to
33:14
encourage you again as i said this is
33:16
for a temporary time
33:18
remember the hourglass thing the sands
33:21
of time are moving through
33:22
and eventually this time will be gone
33:25
and i hope you have
33:26
great memories that you will create and
33:28
make during this time
33:30
make up fun photo shoots with your
33:31
family but there are a few restaurants
33:34
still open out there you know just check
33:36
out and find out who they are
33:37
get their time frame if you still feel
33:39
like you need to go there
33:40
meet with very small groups of people
33:43
and like here in our city now they have
33:45
closed the beaches one of my favorite
33:47
places even if i don't get to go there
33:48
very often
33:50
so people were learning this is the
33:51
thing people were learning
33:53
that they could not gather inside places
33:56
and have
33:56
big events together or just have a party
33:59
together
34:00
they started doing it at the beach our
34:03
beach here is free
34:04
it's a very long beach a beautiful beach
34:07
and they started doing that i mean huge
34:09
groups 50 people here and they were
34:10
meeting
34:11
and they weren't listening to what was
34:13
being asked
34:15
of them and so now they have closed our
34:18
beaches
34:18
i'm sure people are still bicycling up
34:20
and down you know maybe outside the
34:22
beach
34:23
but i just want to encourage you please
34:25
try your very best
34:27
to go along with what they have asked us
34:30
to do
34:30
for a short period of time and when we
34:33
do that
34:34
things are happier the atmosphere is
34:36
better knowing that we're working
34:38
with the government or your city
34:39
authorities or other people who are in
34:41
charge
34:42
they're wanting to help to preserve our
34:45
life
34:46
and like i said before this is not about
34:49
limiting our life
34:50
this is giving the right to live without
34:53
that virus and father i pray for all
34:57
those out there if it's already invaded
34:58
your life
34:59
family members or yourself god i pray
35:02
for them
35:02
and take authority over the sickness
35:05
jesus was over sickness we take
35:06
authority everybody to say it together
35:08
i will no longer tolerate
35:12
sickness sickness or any virus
35:16
or any virus in my city in my city
35:19
in my home in my home and i command it
35:23
and i command it to go to go in jesus
35:27
name jesus
35:28
in jesus name and do you know there's
35:30
even a blessing when you bless your
35:32
dinner did you know
35:33
that you should end your blessing the
35:35
bible says that when you do that when
35:37
you bless god and you bless your food
35:40
it says he will take sickness far from
35:43
you
35:43
you may not have ever read that
35:44
scripture but you know i do remind god
35:46
this is what your word says
35:48
i i thank you for blessing my food to
35:51
the nourishment of my body
35:52
i thank you for the provision of it and
35:54
that might be a good idea to do that now
35:55
even if you don't have food thank him
35:57
for it and asking to bless what is
35:59
coming to you
36:00
our own family experienced people we
36:02
would give so much away our own family
36:04
we'd even give our food away and then my
36:06
dad would have a set the table and thank
36:08
god for the food and i am not making
36:10
this up people would show up at the door
36:11
with food
36:12
so don't limit yourself to what man
36:14
thinks or man's ways not even your
36:16
normal ways
36:18
step outside your box and believe that
36:21
god cares about you
36:23
but yes this is good news chick-fil-a is
36:26
still open
36:27
it's all drive-through there's many few
36:29
a few drive-throughs like i said they're
36:30
different in every city
36:32
so check in your city make sure you pray
36:33
for your local government
36:35
as well as the federal government pray
36:37
for all them
36:38
to hear god's plan to get witty ideas to
36:41
use sound wisdom
36:43
get them to step outside the box and
36:46
make sure you bless ask god to bless
36:48
them it says to bless those who are
36:51
over you when you begin to do the things
36:53
the bible says
36:54
things are going to start happening for
36:56
you so don't get
36:57
moved by things you
37:01
move things this is a kingdom age quote
37:04
you don't get moved by things they don't
37:06
get moved by this virus are you having
37:08
to stay at home are you being
37:10
quarantined make sure you move things
37:13
by declaring and decreeing taking
37:15
authority in the spirit realm over
37:16
anything the enemy is trying to do
37:18
against you those of you who already
37:20
command an
37:21
army from heaven and yes that is
37:23
possible
37:25
jesus did we can too he harkens they
37:28
hearken unto the word of the lord
37:30
he is the lord of hosts he sends them
37:32
here and yes it
37:34
is our privilege to send them to pull
37:36
down strongholds
37:37
they are our mighty weapons to put on
37:39
strongholds against the enemy
37:41

[Music]
40:22
so
40:30
well we're back i hope you enjoyed that
40:32
and again as i said that we
40:34
are going to support um
40:38
president trump right now in the
40:40
decisions you know they're not easy the
40:42
decisions he has to make
40:44
but he has such hope for this country
40:46
and not just this country
40:48
but for the people of this country and i
40:50
know you hear me talk about america but
40:52
you know what this is where i'm from
40:53
this is my realm
40:55
this is where god sent me to live i am
40:57
aware that there are other countries out
40:59
there even great countries that have
41:00
done wonderful things for god
41:02
you know i could start listing them and
41:04
man then we go forever but i do want to
41:06
say
41:07
you know some of the greatest revivals
41:09
we've had in the past many of them were
41:11
actually in
41:12
um in the uk and i can tell you they're
41:15
the covenanters of scotland
41:17
there was patrick and all the kings he
41:20
won
41:20
for jesus christ in ireland and then the
41:23
welsh revival
41:25
wow if you never read about that maybe
41:27
in this time you should go back and
41:29
and to study these things and maybe
41:31
share something with your family
41:33
because there were great people on the
41:34
earth before we were here
41:36
and we're going to be great for god
41:38
because he wants us to be
41:39
and then even when some of you go on to
41:41
heaven there'll be more great people on
41:43
the earth because
41:44
god wants us to be great for him and
41:47
with him and so i am grateful for
41:49
president trump
41:50
if you haven't decided i would encourage
41:52
you to vote for him
41:54
and nominate him you know in this new
41:56
election in 2020
41:58
which will start a whole divine decade
42:00
for us and while we're talking about
42:02
your time right now at home this little
42:04
break in time
42:06
uh we're going to actually show some fun
42:07
things because we like to laugh
42:10
laughter is a medicine it's also a
42:12
weapon because satan can't get to you
42:14
when you are laughing so i hope they
42:15
make you laugh
42:16
here's something we've taken off of
42:17
facebook and other people have made
42:20
it's fun
42:26
so here we go we're going to start
42:28
watching some of them right now
42:30
i hope it makes you laugh and we did
42:33
enjoy
42:33
every single one of these jen did her
42:36
best to get some of the best ones
42:38
and if you have opportunity to see them
42:40
or even create some yourself
42:43
that might be a good idea i think one of
42:46
my
42:47
favorite ones of course is this whole
42:49
discussion about the toilet paper
42:51
you know i do have some rolls i haven't
42:54
counted them lately
42:55
but um maybe you could count them and
42:59
let us know how many you have
43:02
and put it in your comments you know
43:03
that might be fun for people to read oh
43:05
i've got 10
43:06
you know i've got 100 if you've got 100
43:07
you better be sharing them with other
43:09
people right
43:10
and uh but people can be very fun and
43:13
you know who gives that humor
43:14
it's god and so i hope you laughed at
43:17
those there's
43:18
many many more out there um being shown
43:22
and this is funny i love it when the
43:24
pastors and this i'm just going to give
43:27
rod parsley a
43:28
you know a thumb two thumbs up rod that
43:31
was a great little funny thing you did
43:33
with the toilet paper with the tp and uh
43:36
i think tp's taking on a whole new
43:38
meaning right now during this time
43:41
never have we had so much discussion
43:43
about toilet paper
43:45
and uh who would who would think that
43:47
would be an item of interest right not
43:49
just that of course paper towels come
43:50
right in behind that
43:51
and tissues and we go down that hole
43:53
line and you can tell what the most
43:55
important things are right when you go
43:57
to the store what is
43:58
missing the tp and even some of the
44:01
suggestions that other people have of
44:03
what we could use instead
44:04
i haven't found one good suggestion okay
44:07
i'm not adam and eve
44:09
i'm not gonna go pluck leaves off the
44:10
tree that's not gonna happen with me
44:13
and so but i know people people love
44:16
humor
44:17
and sometimes that's a door that will
44:20
open things for people to have
44:21
discussions with you
44:23
like my pink hair i might mention
44:25
briefly about the pink hair i honestly
44:27
i mind sitting here i cannot see the
44:29
pink hair on my head
44:32
and believe it or not sometimes i forget
44:34
it's there but this was not my plan
44:36
this is an example of god's plan right
44:38
here
44:39
this painter on my head and yes it does
44:42
divide asunder the flesh from the spirit
44:45
people who don't like it who bash it who
44:48
say horrible things against it
44:49
they're operating in the flesh the
44:51
people think this is a great idea
44:53
wow god is so creative look at that you
44:56
know what the rainbow belongs to him why
44:58
not have color on your head why not wear
45:00
some of it on your head
45:01
and so that's the spirit the walking in
45:04
the spirit walking in the flesh
45:05
and so god's bringing many new things to
45:07
this earth
45:09
hair color is one of them and i'm taking
45:11
another little drink of my
45:12
strength
45:15
that my man ran up and got for me
45:18
because you know i've been talking a lot
45:19
i'll be talking a whole lot more
45:21
and so why not put fun in your life
45:26
and i remember years ago when the holy
45:28
spirit told me
45:29
yes fun is a medicine laughter is a
45:31
medicine
45:32
the word says it is but he said to me
45:35
while i'm at a platform i can't remember
45:36
where it was
45:37
might have been up north somewhere he
45:39
said did you know that in this time
45:41
that laughter is actually a weapon
45:45
fun is a weapon i mentioned that a
45:47
minute ago why is it a weapon
45:49
satan will put all kinds of thoughts in
45:51
your head and the word says
45:53
take every thought captive that takes
45:56
itself above the plans of the life of
45:58
god
45:58
that means anything that is not good
46:00
anything that does not bring life or
46:02
hope or fun
46:04
creativity or you know to inspire you
46:06
encourage you
46:07
it says to take those thoughts captive
46:10
that means don't let them keep running
46:11
through your mind
46:13
if you've got bad thoughts running from
46:14
you through your mind guess who sent
46:16
them
46:17
it was hell right not heaven heaven
46:20
wants
46:21
life for us and life more abundantly for
46:23
us so you need to realize
46:25
what is running to your mind what are
46:27
your thoughts saying what you think
46:28
about enough is what you will do
46:30
and that's what my husband says also you
46:32
will do
46:34
what you will to do and your will
46:37
is affected by the things you read the
46:40
things you watch
46:41
and get this even the things you say
46:44
will affect the way you live your life
46:46
so make sure you are laughing
46:49
that you make others laugh especially in
46:51
this day
46:52
it really makes the enemy very unhappy
46:57
i will give you a list of things that
46:59
satan hates
47:01
he hates people who love especially when
47:04
they're not being loved back
47:06
he hates it when we're kind to one
47:08
another
47:09
right he hates it when we laugh he hates
47:12
it when we learn to celebrate
47:14
he hates it when we realize that he is
47:18
the one
47:18
causing all the grief all the hate he
47:21
comes to kill steal and destroy
47:24
that's going on in your life that comes
47:26
from one place
47:28
and they don't get any thumbs up they
47:29
get thumbs down there's two thumbs down
47:31
for help right
47:33
and while you're doing your dinner
47:34
blessing why not ask for triple trouble
47:36
in hell
47:37
you'd be amazed what you could ask for
47:39
and god will actually do it
47:41
and so i just want you to realize
47:43
there's a real devil i have been to
47:45
heaven
47:46
i have been to hell you want to choose
47:48
heaven hell
47:49
is not a place it's not going to be r r
47:52
there's no parties in hell no food in
47:54
hell no rest in hell
47:55
that does not exist there's torture
47:57
plenty of it non-going
47:59
ongoing torture that is what is there
48:03
don't side with the enemy don't help him
48:06
advertise
48:07
negative things hateful things mean
48:09
things don't repeat things that are
48:11
going on with your friends and
48:12
especially
48:13
don't repeat negative things about your
48:15
family if you're going to stand for
48:17
their salvation you need to make a stand
48:19
the bible says stand and stand
48:21
there for that means you declare
48:24
that there will become a a living
48:26
testimony of the saving power of jesus
48:28
christ
48:29
you declare that they will not miss the
48:31
destiny god has planned for them
48:33
you declare that they will know christ
48:36
and
48:36
serve him all of their life
48:39
those are powerful piercing words in the
48:43
spirit realm
48:44
and yes it does do something for
48:47
your loved ones as well because you're
48:49
making a stand for them even if they're
48:51
not nice to you and i know that happens
48:53
okay they're not nice they hate you they
48:54
don't want to talk to you
48:56
all that comes from what and the enemy
48:58
is doing with their lives
48:59
so why not make a stand and don't change
49:03
the stand in other words don't be
49:04
double-minded
49:05
if you're saying something powerful god
49:07
will do don't turn around and say the
49:09
opposite
49:10
you don't want to wipe out what you just
49:12
prayed and i can tell right now in this
49:14
time you need to be declaring
49:16
that this is the time for celebration
49:18
for expectation
49:20
a time for god to propel you on your
49:22
path
49:23
that it says we go from glory to glory
49:25
do you know that's an upward motion
49:27
i want to go from glory to glory to
49:28
glory i don't want to go from glory to
49:30
the pit
49:31
and fall into despair and fear glory to
49:34
the pit
49:35
where are you going you are going
49:36
nowhere so kick out of your life
49:39
choose what you will to lose from your
49:42
soul
49:42
any fear any anger any any uh deception
49:46
any confusion all that stuff comes from
49:50
the enemy you bind to your soul
49:53
because i will say this one of the
49:55
things we will be learning about over
49:57
these
49:58
this next week or so is the keys to the
50:00
kingdom
50:01
and how that opens up there's my key
50:03
right there
50:05
how the keys to the kingdom will open up
50:07
things in your life
50:08
you never had before
50:12
and it will eliminate things you don't
50:14
want your life
50:15
that you have not wanted for a very long
50:18
time
50:18
but keep coming back and bombarding you
50:21
or tormenting you
50:22
you can use the keys of the kingdom to
50:24
get rid of them
50:26
an artist friend of mine did a painting
50:29
and sent it to me which is so beautiful
50:31
it shows a person with a key about to
50:33
put it in a keyhole
50:34
and inside this whole keyhole you see
50:37
heaven
50:37
what are they doing when you use the
50:39
keys of the kingdom you are
50:40
unlocking heaven to operate in your life
50:45
so i know a lot of revelation but right
50:48
now we have decided
50:49
and god has asked us to do this
50:51
broadcast mainly to let you know
50:53
that this is not the time that he's
50:55
wrapping everything up
50:57
this is not the time for the tribulation
50:59
and as the holy spirit says
51:01
the four horses of the apocalypse are
51:03
still in the barn
51:05
and you know what the nephilim are not
51:07
roaming the earth right now coming to
51:09
knock on your door and drag you out in
51:11
the streets
51:12
uh the antichrist this is truth the
51:15
antichrist
51:16
and you can say i believe it or not the
51:19
antichrist
51:21
the antichrist spirit is on the earth
51:22
because that's satan and the antichrist
51:25
spirit
51:25
is anything that is against god that
51:27
would be like a false religion
51:29
that's an antichrist spirit anyone who
51:31
is against
51:32
christ himself and speaks against him
51:35
trying to say he is not the son of god
51:37
that none of that stuff is true in the
51:38
bible that is an antichrist spirit
51:40
the antichrist spirit is on the earth
51:43
but the antichrist himself and there's
51:45
even some people to say he's not going
51:47
to be here either
51:48
they are mistaken at one time
51:52
generations down god's timeline
51:55
those things he said in his word they
51:57
will happen
51:58
he has a purpose for them happening even
52:00
when we don't understand them
52:02
but you're in a blessed time to be alive
52:04
on this earth you are not
52:06
living in the time of the tribulation
52:10
or the perilous times or the antichrist
52:13
who will actually embody a person
52:15
it's just satan embodying a person
52:17
that's what that is the antichrist is
52:20
not
52:20
on the earth he and what he will do is
52:23
not on this earth right now
52:25
because the word says until he until he
52:29
is removed that withholds the antichrist
52:32
can't come
52:32
guess who that he is it's us the body of
52:36
christ
52:36
ruling and reigning with christ the
52:38
manifested sons and daughters speaking
52:40
to the lamb the sea and the air
52:41
commanding things to happen
52:43
with jesus christ and they happen if
52:46
they were all still here
52:48
the antichrist would not be effective
52:50
people wouldn't even receive him
52:52
it wouldn't be the tribulation time
52:54
because this time
52:55
of the manifested sons and daughters on
52:57
the earth things will be great things
52:58
will be healed things will be better
53:01
we're living in the time okay god's time
53:04
right now
53:05
is for us to be great for him to take
53:08
the knowledge of the glory
53:11
that's not just a saying that is an
53:14
action
53:16
the glory of god coming from you is like
53:20
it's like something begins to just go
53:22
and waves from you
53:24
and it will remove the enemy in people's
53:26
lives it will invade
53:28
their life their very person with the
53:31
presence of god it's like a cosmic shock
53:33
wave
53:33
like if i have my staff right now and i
53:35
just hit it
53:37
on the ground wherever i declare things
53:39
from god and i hit my staff which is
53:41
always out with me
53:42
at three in the morning as i'm declaring
53:43
the things of god i see in the spirit a
53:46
shock wave of the fire of god
53:48
going that's what the glory will do
53:52
you will take that around this world and
53:56
that hasn't even begun to happen yet
53:59
so we're not living in the perilous
54:00
times we're living in the great times of
54:03
god
54:04
the times and all those things would
54:06
begin to happen he talked about
54:08
be excited you're alive be excited you
54:11
have children
54:12

54:14
have children they'll be greater than
54:16
you will
54:18
look forward to your children doing
54:19
greater things and being greater for
54:21
christ
54:21
than even you this is just the beginning
54:24
of a time on the earth that's never
54:26
existed so this
54:27
is not the very end he is not
54:31
going to wrap it all up and roll this
54:33
earth away
54:34
when he hasn't even begun to do the
54:36
things he
54:37
himself declared would happen look
54:40
forward to celebrating with you
54:42
i look forward to sharing with you that
54:44
god
54:45
is about great things he's behind the
54:47
scenes of everything on this earth right
54:49
now
54:50
even leaders it's a time of being
54:53
shifted
54:54
god is shifting the leaders of
54:57
governments
54:58
so he can then shape their nation
55:01
and that's what's happening in our
55:03
country right now

01:05
i'm going to share what was going on in
01:07
the spirit realm
01:08
while all this worship is going on
01:13
you have some new hosts that are posted
01:16
here as sentinels
01:18
and uh i used to call them well well
01:21
they look like native americans
01:22
but no they've always looked like that
01:26
there's whole tribes of angels that look
01:28
like that that wear garments like that
01:30
with the symbols you know and the way
01:33
that that
01:33
came into this world was god has always
01:36
had seers
01:37
and some of the first nations were seers
01:41
and so they took some of those images
01:43
that they've seen on these beings and
01:45
they put them on their garments they put
01:46
them on their
01:47
on their tents their homes uh many of
01:50
the things you
01:51
buy that are called southwest images are
01:53
actually images from the throne room
01:56
and he has some pretty wild drummers up
01:59
there
01:59
and they were here today and there were
02:02
two new ones i had not seen they weren't
02:04
even here yesterday
02:06
they're about 70 foot tall they had
02:08
fallout headdress on them
02:12
they had pelts with living eyes the
02:14
feathers had living eyes
02:16
every feather in the headdress they were
02:18
like blue eyes all over them
02:21
and their garments just shown with the
02:23
glory and there's one
02:24
right there and there's one right there
02:27
and they were dancing the whole time we
02:29
were dancing
02:31
and i could hear that drum i love the
02:33
drum
02:34
drum sound from the throne room um when
02:37
that is played
02:38
and they were playing somewhere outside
02:40
playing there were those two main ones
02:41
but there are others
02:42
and then some came in and were dancing
02:44
on this platform
02:46
and i recently saw the same ones in reno
02:49
nevada
02:50
on the platform and they're angels of
02:52
freedom
02:55
they were they were doing a freedom
02:58
dance here
02:59
and uh freedom is coming from everything
03:02
at the enemy in golden
03:04
in denver colorado
03:06
[Applause]
03:11
and if you've ever seen some of the the
03:14
first nations or the native americans
03:16
dance
03:17
when they do that thing where they're
03:18
like this they were up here there were
03:20
two of them
03:21
and they're like dressed in blue they
03:24
have blue feathers going at the very top
03:26
of their head
03:27
right up here and there have eyes in
03:29
those feathers and all the feathers
03:31
coming
03:32
off of their wings have eyes and when i
03:34
saw them in reno
03:36
i asked the lord what are they and he
03:38
goes those are freedom dancers bringing
03:41
freedom to the area so
03:45
i i can tell you also that god is taking
03:48
las vegas and reno
03:53
as regions of as regions of glory
03:56
this will be a region of glory where
03:58
crime or sickness
04:00
where disease cannot exist
04:07
so i was i was so excited when i saw
04:10
them here today and went
04:11
so i knew who they were i knew what they
04:13
were and i could tell you the men that
04:15
were dancing you were dancing with them
04:18
up here on the platform and the glory
04:21
was just
04:21
rolling off of them as they were dancing
04:23
the glory
04:24
and so freedom and liberty is coming uh
04:28
tour land two to colorado
04:31
to nevada god is taking those regions
04:34
all right
04:35
so your lives will not be the same
04:40
and even after this weekend you cannot
04:42
remain the same
04:44
because when you have stepped into and
04:46
receive what god is
04:48
offering in this time you can't miss or
04:51
escape
04:51
receiving it you're going to get it
04:54
because you said yes
04:56
everyone yell yes now look
05:00
look up and so say i say yes
05:03
[Applause]
05:06
and so uh well i'll try to speak if i
05:09
can but they they're really outside
05:12
right now looking in there are they are
05:14
huge
05:15
beings and in in their chest they have
05:19
these strips of like
05:20
it looks like gold metal to me it's
05:23
probably real gold i'm sure it is
05:24
and in them and all these metal pieces
05:27
are shaped like that
05:28
and they have living eyes in them in the
05:31
front
05:32
in the back to see anything of the enemy
05:34
that comes against this ministry
05:37
against your people these beings will
05:40
drive them off and deal harshly with
05:44
[Applause]
05:50
them
05:52
yes yeah
05:56
just like the things of the enemy are
05:58
drawn
05:59
where there's evil where there's
06:01
darkness where there's hate where
06:02
there's violence
06:03
and i know a lot of people think well i
06:06
won't go watch movies that have
06:07
immorality in
06:08
or defiling language but violence
06:12
is just as bad it is and i want to
06:14
remind you
06:15
that one of the accusations the father
06:17
had against lucifer was
06:19
you have filled yourself with violence
06:24
so be aware when you go to watch
06:26
something
06:28
make sure it's not graphic sadistic
06:30
torturing violence
06:31
because that will go in your soul you
06:33
don't want it in there amen we're about
06:36
life not death watch things that give
06:40
life they bring celebration in your life
06:42
they're going to help your soul to
06:43
prosper
06:46
there is a promise for divine help there
06:48
really is
06:49
even as your soul prospers you will
06:52
prosper in be
06:54
in hell that is a state of existence
06:58
coming to the body of christ who will
07:00
let their soul prosper
07:03
so we need to keep the darkness out the
07:05
violence out
07:06
anything defiling keep it out you have
07:08
to guard that innermost part of your
07:10
being
07:11
the very heart of your being is where
07:13
your soul is
07:15
that's why it was so important when god
07:17
said adam became a
07:19
living soul we are not just people
07:23
we're not just a spirit we're the with a
07:26
body
07:26
people go well we have a soul no you are
07:29
a
07:30
soul according to the father you are a
07:33
living soul
07:34
it's one of the main parts of you you
07:36
can't leave that out of your life
07:38
you can't remain ignorant of your soul
07:41
because it's what you think on what you
07:42
choose and then what you do
07:45
i would say that was you yeah so more
07:48
and more in this time
07:50
we must be aware of of our soul and what
07:52
we're letting in there
07:54
as a man think us in that place
07:58
so is he out of your soul will flow the
08:02
way
08:02
you live your life the issues of life
08:05
out of it before the issues of life that
08:06
means the way you will live your life
08:08
that's what the father told me and so
08:11
the soul is very key in your life
08:13
even in your children's lives what you
08:15
put in their soul growing up
08:17
it's going to help them become who god
08:19
wants them to become
08:21
you're not just raising a child not even
08:23
the next generation you are
08:25
shaping souls in your life every day
08:28
you're shaping your own soul
08:31
your soul gets fed 24 hours a day
08:34
whatever's going around you whatever
08:36
you're whatever you're seeing
08:38
watching saying or hearing
08:42
it goes in there it goes in there
08:45
a lot of meetings
08:50
but i get excited i had to almost sit on
08:52
myself
08:53
to not start screaming
08:57
[Applause]
09:00
i've heard that around the throne i have
09:03
been there and i've heard it
09:05
it is stunning you will get so undone
09:10
by the glory over the throne and the
09:13
seraphim
09:13
who come down and dip out of there
09:15
they're so full of the fire
09:17
they are on fire they sing some of the
09:20
most beautiful song they will dip down
09:22
over the throne
09:23
and go back up and dip down over the
09:25
throne and go back up
09:29
yeah satan didn't get any of them
09:36
even in heaven they choose how much of a
09:40
relationship
09:40
they want
09:45
it was obvious and you would think
09:49
the ones who were created for worship
09:53
would not have been deceived
09:57
but they were the very ones because they
10:00
followed
10:01
they began to follow the one who led
10:04
them
10:05
not the one who made them
10:13
if they were deceived by the enemy
10:16
deception
10:17
is still it is an anti-christ spirit
10:22
and even then it was it was even jesus
10:24
said it was then
10:25
it was there even then it was there and
10:27
so i think one of the most
10:29
one of the most number one weapons the
10:31
enemy uses today
10:32
when he realizes because of our
10:34
relationship our intimacy with god
10:37
when he realizes he's not going to get
10:38
us to just outright sin
10:40
then he will try to bring us into into
10:42
deception or
10:44
distraction because we need to stay on
10:47
that path we
10:48
are running after him and no matter what
10:51
i talk about about the encounters that i
10:53
i've had or what i've seen or the
10:55
revelation he's given me still the
10:57
number one thing in my life
10:58
is to pursue him to be passionate about
11:02
him
11:02
to desire his heart his ways his words
11:06
his presence it feeds me
11:12
i eat less and less because i eat of him
11:17
there's a whole revelation about eat my
11:20
flesh and
11:21
drink my blood that is total consumption
11:24
of who he is
11:26
you are totally consuming all of him
11:29
all of what he did i love to talk about
11:31
the blood of christ
11:34
i was caught up to heaven take him back
11:36
in time and i saw him pouring out his
11:38
blood
11:38
on the mercy seat
11:43
so many encounters but nothing more
11:45
powerful
11:46
than knowing the love of christ
11:50
to know him to know not just know about
11:52
him but to know him
11:54
and he said that if you pursue him with
11:56
all of your heart
11:58
you will find him and when you find him
12:03
you will want to be just like him
12:07
it says when we see him we will no
12:09
longer know in part
12:11
or understand in part it says now we see
12:13
darkly like through a glass
12:15
we see in part we know in part but when
12:18
you see
12:18
him you will no longer know in part
12:22
that means you will know details that
12:23
means you will know his heart
12:25
his ways have his thoughts so don't ever
12:28
stop doing that
12:30
no matter what you go after in your life
12:32
don't ever
12:33
leave him out i have written in the
12:35
front of my bible
12:37
don't ever let me get to a place where i
12:39
do not need you
12:41
[Music]
12:45
in the past god would do things to
12:49
make sure that people weren't elevated
12:51
above because of the revelation that
12:53
they got
12:55
you know even in paul that thorn of
12:57
flesh he got was blindness
13:01
it would come and go it would attack him
13:02
and go attack him and go
13:04
and a lot of people don't know what that
13:05
is they they try to figure it out but
13:07
it's in the word
13:09
because paul said the first time i came
13:12
to you
13:13
you wanted to give me everything if
13:15
possible you would have plucked out your
13:17
very
13:17
eyes and given them to me
13:21
why would he have said that why did he
13:24
need to scribe all the time
13:27
because it was hard for him to see to
13:28
write
13:30
so whenever he penned a letter that said
13:33
i
13:33
have penned this with my own hand
13:37
you need to go back and read those
13:40
because he was so
13:41
fierce about having this given to them
13:44
and them
13:44
living a right life a powerful life
13:48
he would write that himself
13:51
even with that on him now i can tell you
13:54
that he stopped asking for that to be
13:56
removed when christ said
13:58
my grace is sufficient my grace is
14:02
sufficient
14:03
for the evil for for the day for the
14:05
evil thereof
14:07
and that was grace for abundant life
14:08
christ was talking about
14:10
christ never came to put sickness
14:13
disease
14:14
infirmities he never brought poverty
14:16
with him
14:17
he didn't bring fear with him he didn't
14:19
bring hopelessness or unworthiness
14:21
he didn't bring any of those he came to
14:24
bring light
14:26
and life more abundantly
14:30
and we need to walk on that today now
14:34
not just when you go to heaven
14:36
[Music]
14:37
in the past people died to move to
14:40
heaven
14:41
to walk in a certain way on in their
14:44
life
14:45
they were free from everything creative
14:48
inventive in heaven adventure excitement
14:50
fun
14:51
no fear no hate no deception
14:55
no distractions filled with the light
14:58
and the glory of god
15:00
but in this time on the earth
15:04
we have a commission to live
15:07
a whole new way so what you've been
15:10
hearing me talk about
15:11
is not just some nice things to make you
15:14
feel good
15:15
it is so you can have a new lifestyle
15:19
to live on earth as they do in heaven
15:23
that's not going to be a normal life
15:27
it's going to be the most amazing life
15:30
you have
15:30
ever lived in this world and god wants
15:34
it
15:34
wants it seen openly and
15:37
visibly in our lives
15:41
the goodness of god overwhelming us
15:44
flowing off of us wherever we go the
15:47
creativity of god
15:49
we are supposed to be creators like our
15:52
father say amen
15:55
let us make man in our image what is
15:58
your image he's a creator
16:00
what is christ's image a commander
16:06
they rule there's no higher level
16:09
anywhere in existence than the the
16:12
triune godhead
16:15
and yet how awesome is that that he said
16:18
that statement
16:20
in genesis let us make man in our image
16:24
and after our likeness that word
16:26
likeness means
16:27
operate like we do
16:31
we are joint ears with christ he walked
16:34
in so much
16:35
and we're living so far below that but
16:37
in this day because of revelation
16:40
this is what revelation is it comes from
16:42
the heart of the father
16:44
it does not come from the mind of man so
16:46
it will not sound
16:48
normal to you it won't even make sense
16:51
to you
16:52
sometimes it seems absolutely impossible
16:54
but with god
16:56
nothing is impossible all things
17:00
through christ are possible
17:04
so we need to understand and realize
17:06
what did christ give us when he came
17:08
here
17:10
what was he on this earth walking as
17:13
a righteous man
17:16
he had power and authority over the
17:18
storms
17:20
he multiplied the food he raised the
17:23
dead
17:23
all the time he never blinked at one
17:26
demon not one demon was he afraid of
17:30
where he went they were tormented
17:34
he could shift time and step in the
17:37
spirit realm and walk
17:38
through people he didn't walk around
17:42
those crowds he walked through them
17:44
because the spirit realm supersedes this
17:47
natural realm
17:49
that's why angelic means can walk
17:51
through the walls
17:54
so christ did all these amazing powerful
17:57
things
17:58
and then he says the things i did
18:02
you will do and
18:05
greater things than he did we will do
18:10
we're still trying to figure out the
18:11
things he did
18:15
you're not getting anything without
18:17
faith
18:19
you're not ever going to get to a point
18:20
where you don't need faith to do things
18:24
you have to start trusting god and
18:26
telling him you trust
18:28
him he wants you to say something
18:32
he loves it when you make declarations
18:34
he gets up off the throne and he shouts
18:38
when he sees people on the earth with
18:40
faith christ didn't say when i come
18:43
will i see power will i see dominion
18:46
will i see creativity will i see souls
18:49
being saved
18:50
no we didn't say they said well i see
18:54
faith
18:56
and so many people they just want things
18:59
but they don't even use their faith
19:02
you go from glory to glory because of
19:04
your faith
19:06
your faith can grow when you when you
19:08
hit a certain level
19:09
your faith just gets accelerated
19:13
where no matter what he has said no
19:15
matter what that word says
19:16
you live it like it's truth
19:21
we all have measures but did you realize
19:25
that a measure means it can be increased
19:28
[Applause]
19:29
if you pour something in a measuring cup
19:33
can you add more
19:40
and you can get a bigger cup
19:45
until it's pouring over isn't that what
19:47
it says
19:50
overflowing
19:52
if you get to a place in him
19:56
i want everybody to say this christ
19:58
operated
20:00
without measure on this earth
20:06
[Music]
20:09
his dream and his purpose
20:13
is for us to get to that place in him
20:16
where we
20:17
also operate without measure
20:21
i know what i'm talking about because i
20:23
was uh
20:24
in law i i worked in law that was a god
20:27
thing told
20:28
totally let me tell you they hired me
20:30
with no experience because
20:32
i was anointed with favor
20:35
and literally i was hired because of the
20:37
favor not because of my typing skills
20:42
trust me you type 40 words a minute no
20:44
one's going to want you
20:46
in the natural but i was taught i was
20:49
hired
20:50
and i was taught by the lawyers how to
20:53
do real estate law
20:54
estate planning business law
20:58
i learned all kinds of these different
20:59
levels of the different law and the
21:01
legal system
21:02
one thing i really got was in a probate
21:05
in a state
21:06
i totally knew what it meant when it
21:08
said you were a joint
21:09
heir if you're an
21:12
heir to somebody even like in england
21:16
the heir to the throne no one can say
21:19
you can't have that
21:22
it's written as law in those countries
21:25
so guess what was written in heaven as
21:27
law
21:29
that there was a last will and testament
21:31
called the new
21:32
testament that the the names of these
21:35
books aren't just put there because they
21:37
sound good
21:39
every one of those names means something
21:41
like revelations
21:44
someone tell me there's nowhere in the
21:45
bible that talks about revelations
21:50
i said god calls me a revelator i'm here
21:52
to reveal heaven
21:53
i'm here to reveal the spirit realm i'm
21:55
here here to reveal the true authority
21:57
of the believer the dominion and
21:58
authority of the believer and they go
22:00
there's no such thing as a revelator
22:03
i think john was one
22:08
a revelator simply means you reveal the
22:10
things of god
22:11
and what do you think revelations were
22:13
those were the revelations
22:15
john re received and shared
22:18
things never heard of before things that
22:20
were hard to comprehend
22:22
you think the book of revelations is
22:24
easy to understand it's because it came
22:26
from the heart of god
22:28
and he reveals himself all the time even
22:31
john the baptist gave some of the most
22:32
shocking revelations of all time
22:35
he was totally shifting the way that
22:38
those who believed in god
22:40
were going to live hey they knew you had
22:44
to go to
22:44
temple and make sacrifices and once a
22:47
year your sins were forgiven
22:49
and here was this wild man wearing camel
22:52
hair
22:53
turned inside out lived in the
22:55
wilderness he looked like a wild man
22:58
ate locust and honey was his diet
23:03
pizza and chocolate ice cream is a whole
23:04
lot better
23:07
and so is pink hair
23:12
pizza there's pizza in heaven
23:21
yes i do like it but i like thin crusts
23:26
not that
23:28
zero calories yes and zero calories in
23:31
heaven
23:34
it's one of the reasons why they call it
23:35
heaven
23:39
but it's the place where things have
23:41
never been heard of
23:43
or seen or even understood but god has
23:46
prepared for those that love him
23:48
but i love the next part of that
23:50
scripture unless
23:52
and accept it be revealed by his spirit
23:56
so that shows you the things of god can
23:58
be revealed there are mysteries in the
24:00
word
24:01
and the first time you hear them you'll
24:02
be shocked
24:04
that they were there all along but you
24:06
didn't see them because they were a
24:07
mystery
24:10
but god loves to share them with his
24:12
children
24:14
so be more like a child laugh a lot more
24:20
dream imagine the impossible
24:26
there's places telling you not to even
24:27
do that anymore
24:30
and yet let me tell you if you're an
24:32
artist if you don't
24:33
imagine things you can't you can't
24:35
produce or create
24:38
that god puts that in us to be creators
24:42
uh like an inventor that's still a
24:44
creator right
24:45
inventions witty ideas we're creators
24:49
you should be creating something all the
24:51
time
24:52
you should be doing something new all
24:54
the time you should be new
24:56
all the time i heard the father yell
24:59
tell them to be new
25:01
do something new go someplace new
25:06
think of something new say
25:10
something new don't remain the same
25:14
old same-o that's right yeah don't be
25:17
boring
25:19
see this world needs to see this
25:22
they need to hear this they need to know
25:26
that you can live without fear when you
25:28
belong to jesus christ
25:30
because you do have power over all the
25:32
power of the enemy
25:33
that we can crush the plans of darkness
25:36
that we can have
25:37
none of him in us
25:39
[Music]
25:40
and be dangerous
25:42
[Applause]
25:44
i love the whole army thing yeah
25:49
heaven has an army
25:52
strange weird
25:56
fierce unshakable
25:59
unstoppable created by the hand of god
26:03
himself
26:04
to defeat that army of darkness
26:07
but they were never created to guard
26:09
heaven
26:12
that army didn't even kick out satan
26:15
the father did the father did
26:19
he didn't even get off the throne
26:24
went up there shaking in heaven he
26:26
wasn't shaken in heaven but lucifer was
26:27
going around tempting all of them
26:30
he knew he would lose
26:34
but he was going to let others see who
26:36
really was
26:37
worshiping him who really had
26:40
given herself to what they were created
26:43
for
26:44
we replace all the angels that worship
26:46
before the throne
26:49
so you go before the throne every single
26:51
time you worship
26:52
that's how he inhabits the praises of
26:54
his people
26:56
you're connecting with heaven every
26:58
single time you worship
27:02
so when you hear about heaven it should
27:04
be something
27:06
oh yes i was going to tell you what else
27:08
i saw
27:10
right before the trumpet blew i heard
27:13
the lord say that calvary is coming
27:29
i was really having fun in this service
27:34
because i was seeing um heaven here and
27:37
what they were doing
27:39
then i saw the people connecting the
27:41
worship connecting the dancing
27:42
connecting
27:43
that they were all hearing what heaven
27:45
was saying and singing
27:46
so they played it and the dancers were
27:50
actually
27:50
impressed by what the angels were
27:52
dancing up here they were doing the same
27:54
thing
27:55
yeah and even the ones outside and the
27:58
drummers that were
27:59
lightning bolts were shooting off of
28:01
those drums
28:02
[Applause]
28:06
and and i would get so undone i had to
28:08
sit down
28:09
so i wouldn't fall down
28:13
because the glory was so thick in here
28:16
and they would dance and dance then he
28:18
would turn and look
28:20
in the window to watch
28:23
you dance and worship
28:26
and flag and shout
28:30
[Music]
28:31
[Applause]
28:53
[Music]
29:02
every congregation needs a seer
29:06
because you get so excited to really see
29:10
you
29:10
are a part of what heaven is doing
29:12
that's right because every time you
29:13
shout it whenever you shouted
29:15
they shouted in the throne room
29:18
every time you shouted something the
29:21
throne room
29:22
shouted it
29:37
[Applause]
29:42
and the father would sit there and he
29:44
would laugh and laughter he threw his
29:46
head back
29:54
because there are those who worship in
29:57
spirit and truth
29:58
on the earth and every time we do it
30:02
it pierces the enemy
30:08
and every time we do it there's the
30:11
father began to laugh
30:12
and it goes like dominoes around all of
30:15
heaven it just starts like a
30:16
wave of people laughing and laughing and
30:21
laughing
30:23
because there's a people who worship in
30:25
spirit and truth
30:26
the enemy doesn't want anyone to worship
30:28
anything
30:30
but him and you
30:33
you know he stole the glory that's what
30:35
he did he wanted to be the glory and
30:38
have the glory
30:39
and he wanted all of it even when he was
30:41
in heaven that was a bad decision
30:45
bad decision so we get to carry the
30:49
glory produce the glory
30:51
and carry the glory around this world
30:53
for him and is going to
30:55
undo this world they will be undone
31:00
i've seen some of that happening and i
31:02
know it will
31:03
it will cause thousands to run into the
31:05
kingdom
31:07
because they know what kind of life
31:08
they've been living they know what
31:10
darkness is
31:11
everything darkness has marked
31:13
everything
31:15
it's left its mark in the movies in
31:17
books and children's toys
31:19
in apparel it's just marked everywhere
31:22
it's about to be wiped out because
31:23
heaven's going to put its mark on
31:25
everything
31:25
[Applause]
31:31
you'll be able to buy home decor things
31:34
to decorate your home with
31:36
rugs things to put on your windows even
31:39
the furniture
31:40
will have symbols and images of heaven
31:42
on it
31:45
and you are past it'll speak
31:49
because god is going to put his
31:51
anointing on it
31:54
it's one of the ways the glory will
31:55
invade this earth that's one of the
31:57
reasons why heaven is invading this
31:59
earth
32:03
you'll sit on your amazing self of this
32:06
anointed and you'll just hear
32:07
sounds from heaven your walls will
32:11
release
32:12
frequencies from heaven in them
32:16
you've already created when you create
32:18
an atmosphere for heaven to inhabit your
32:20
home
32:22
and it will if they see the life of god
32:26

33:14
what we build for god on the earth in
33:16
the spirit and then the physical
33:18
is about to be accelerated
33:25
because this is god's time for that to
33:27
happen
33:28
so when you step into what he wants
33:32
you can't escape being blessed
33:35
you're not going to escape he used to
33:37
say that to me other times you are not
33:39
going to escape
33:41
when you say you're going to go say this
33:43
and you will not escape doing it
33:46
okay no matter what they think
33:49
no matter where it is or what it is i'm
33:52
saying it
33:54
and i'll say it as loud and as boldly
33:57
and as often as you want to
33:58
you want me to i laid down my life died
34:02
to myself
34:03
and i live in christ
34:06
and the devil can't impact a dead person
34:11
he can't tempt a dead person he can't
34:14
put
34:15
fear in them if there's none of him in
34:17
you he can't do anything to you
34:20
amen jesus said i give you power
34:24
over all the power of the enemy to tread
34:26
upon
34:27
so i can't even say it serpents and
34:30
scorpions
34:31
tread upon them and
34:34
nothing by
34:37
any means shall harm you
34:42
we're living in those days
34:46
in this new time we are living in those
34:48
days
34:50
that our life will be different because
34:53
we will be living
34:54
on earth as they do in heaven
34:59
if you heard me talk you know a lot
35:01
about heaven you should know a lot about
35:02
heaven
35:04
because god is bringing revelation on
35:06
purpose
35:08
why is he showing us heaven why do we
35:09
need to know how it operates
35:11
what is life like there what goes on
35:13
what places does he have
35:14
what do they get to do you need to know
35:17
that because we're going to live like
35:19
that down here
35:22
oh yeah they worship it's called
35:26
living worship not just
35:30
in the throne room bowing down
35:33
sometimes everybody just jumps up and
35:35
down for fun
35:37
[Applause]
35:40
yes it's holy but it is fun
35:46
some people think why should i even go
35:47
to heaven it's going to be so boring
35:50
no you've lived boring down here
35:56
because they have the greatest
35:58
adventures in heaven
36:03
god wouldn't have said you must be like
36:05
little
36:06
children to enter into the kingdom of
36:11
he'd be in big trouble if we all got up
36:13
there and we were like
36:14
you know old minded with all the fun
36:16
stuff he's made
36:18
but he knows when you come there that's
36:20
how you feel
36:21
because you're free of any cares any
36:24
concerns
36:25
you're not always warring just to to
36:27
stay safe and pay your rent
36:32
everyone up there pays for nothing
36:36
god has already made a provision and
36:37
supplied your mansion's built before you
36:40
ever get there
36:42
and everything you want love or need is
36:44
already there
36:47
but god has a sense of humor
36:50
the number one thing before besides
36:52
going in the throne room people love to
36:53
do is take tours of heaven
36:56
and they have tour guide angels that has
37:00
a cap that says tour guide and they have
37:01
a money changer belt
37:04
you know the little things that go push
37:06
click click click and the coins come
37:08
out nobody has money in heaven
37:14
they do it for humor
37:20
and and and you'll get there for the
37:22
first time they'll they already know who
37:24
the new people are
37:27
because they're like this
37:38
and then walked up one of these tour
37:39
guide angels and they go um
37:42
do you have your pass
37:43
[Laughter]
37:47
on purpose
37:51
and you hear people all around they're
37:53
giggling
37:55
because they know you don't need a pass
37:58
however the real characters go his name
38:01
is jesus christ
38:04
so if you've got one in your family this
38:05
probably will be the response
38:07
some of the others are like we need a
38:09
pass
38:12
who gave out the passes
38:18
and people laugh i mean they will laugh
38:20
and laugh and laugh and laugh
38:22
there's no past required
38:26
and you're not going to give anybody
38:28
money to go anywhere
38:30
[Applause]
38:31
you can step on a road of light and just
38:33
go yourself
38:40
and everybody talks about the humor of
38:42
god but but when you really experience
38:44
it
38:44
you realize how funny he can be
38:51
and his goodness people live in his
38:53
goodness
38:55
about a year ago he started saying start
38:57
declaring the goodness of god over your
38:59
family
39:00
your friends especially your enemies
39:06
there's almost nothing more fun than
39:08
blessing those who are cursing you
39:12
as a seer especially it's a lot of fun
39:16
because i see the demons controlling the
39:18
people who are blasting me
39:20
and i'm blessing them and those demons
39:23
are going stop
39:24
[Music]
39:26
they're screaming it's like arrows
39:29
piercing them
39:32
because i'm giving them life
39:35
which cancels out the death
39:39
that's why he said bless those right who
39:42
curse you pray for those who
39:43
despitefully
39:46
it's powerful blessing
39:50
is a weapon joy and celebration is a
39:54
weapon
39:55
fun is a weapon
39:59
they laugh all the time in heaven they
40:01
have amazing adventures
40:03
there's so many places to go and visit
40:05

they'll even show you some of the best
41:20
places to go and see
41:24
a tour guide without the cap
41:32
oh yeah the hunting is in heaven is
41:34
something else
41:36
people say nothing dies oh no nothing
41:38
dies
41:39
[Laughter]
41:42
you have photo shoots you capture what
41:44
you're hunting
41:45
by photo you have a scope camera
41:49
i'm serious about all this uh
41:52
somebody well known i don't ever mention
41:54
their name but i always tell the story
41:56
it's amazing one of the encounters i had
41:59
a young man had ended his suffering
42:02
and a lot of people were telling this uh
42:04
prophet that
42:06
it was too bad that his son was in hell
42:08
when he had served god his whole life
42:12
the people in the world weren't saying
42:13
that we are so sorry that you have lost
42:16
your son
42:18
we know you loved him we know how we
42:20
would feel so you know
42:22
we we are having compassion for you we
42:24
really are
42:25
caring about you and we'll pray even
42:27
people who don't pray
42:28
will tell people we'll pray
42:32
that's the world saying that most of the
42:34
body was saying they're burning in hell
42:38
and that was the first time god taught
42:40
me about the difference between suicide
42:42
and ending your life
42:44
and ending your suffering he said when
42:47
you're not in your right mind
42:49
control of emotion whether it's
42:51
emotional physical
42:52
or mental you're not in control of your
42:55
own emotions
42:56
you're not you cannot think clearly or
42:59
make decisions you just know you cannot
43:01
suffer any longer so you end your
43:04
suffering
43:06
and he said those people go to heaven
43:10
he made me go to the dictionary which he
43:12
does many times
43:14
uh he has me gives me scriptures in the
43:16
word but he also says to go look in the
43:17
dictionary
43:18
to see what man says about it he said go
43:20
look up the word suicide
43:22
and it says willingly knowingly
43:24
intelligently taking your own life
43:28
he said but what most people are
43:29
experiencing that's not
43:31
that's not what they're doing okay a
43:34
suicide bomber
43:36
or a terrorist that is real suicide
43:39
they know that their life will end and
43:42
they purposely go do it because they
43:43
know
43:44
usually to bring violence or hurt to
43:45
someone else to make others suffer
43:48
is usually what suicide is about so
43:51
these these bombers are coming bomb
43:53
strapped on them
43:54
they're intelligently making this
43:55
decision oh yeah i'm willing to do this
43:57
to take the lives of others
43:59
they committed suicide but people
44:02
who either through accidents or mental
44:05
stress or emotional uh when they get to
44:09
despair
44:10
when you reach despair it's like
44:12
sickness
44:14
that they can't handle any longer so
44:16
they're ending their suffering
44:18
it's not that they don't love you it's
44:20
not that they don't want to live anymore
44:22
they can't stand the suffering and i
44:24
literally was caught up to heaven and
44:26
told that
44:26
and the father said you will tell people
44:28
about that
44:30
and i had people say don't say that how
44:33
can you say that i went would you like
44:34
to go stand before the living
44:36
god and have him explain what this means
44:40
and then you say i'm not going to say it
44:43
and they go well maybe not
44:48
and he said this is going to help
44:49
relieve the pain
44:51
and agony that people have been put
44:53
through with the loss of their loved
44:55
ones
44:55
who no longer had any control over their
44:58
minds or their thoughts
45:00
or their will and he said those people
45:03
i would be unjust and unrighteous
45:05
especially if they knew me
45:07
i would be unjust and unrighteous just
45:09
to give them to the enemy who actually
45:10
destroyed them
45:13
and he said you let them know they're in
45:14
heaven they're with me
45:16
and so he actually did this because of
45:18
that young man because of what happened
45:19
to him
45:20
and what people were saying to this this
45:22
prophet
45:23
god said i'm going to show you where his
45:25
son is
45:26
this person was visiting our church i
45:28
was doing hospitality for him when he
45:29
came
45:30
and i actually had bought all the stuff
45:31
to put the food together and in the
45:33
parking lot of my church she caught me
45:34
up to heaven
45:37
and i saw this miss this man's son
45:40
i think he was probably in his 20s and i
45:43
didn't know anything about him
45:45
and i saw him standing in his father's
45:47
mansion that was still being built
45:52
and there was a trophy on this mantle
45:55
that said satan zero
45:59
god won
46:04
and that was because satan didn't get
46:06
his son and he said you're gonna go tell
46:08
him that his son is with me in heaven
46:10
and then i and this went on for a while
46:13
he
46:14
caught me up a second time he said i'm
46:15
going to show you what he's now doing
46:16
now
46:17
and i saw him putting equipment on on
46:19
this horse he was going to go
46:21
backpacking and up a trail ride
46:23
up the mountain spices and i saw this
46:26
at the foothills was this huge mansion
46:30
that he had come out of that i knew was
46:32
his father's mansion
46:34
and so it was this beautiful amazing
46:35
place all made out of stone
46:37
living stones
46:40
not just stone there's nothing normal or
46:44
plain in heaven
46:45
there were this whole place was built
46:47
with living stones
46:49
and so i saw his son and he was talking
46:51
i can't wait for my dad to get here one
46:53
day man
46:54
he's going to be so excited to find out
46:56
there's some other way to hunt animals
47:00
this is going to be exciting this is his
47:01
first time going up there by the way
47:04
i'm sure he had some other thoughts
47:05
about that but but he that's what he was
47:07
doing us i put camera equipment on the
47:09
stuff
47:10
on this this beautiful horse there was
47:12
another horse with some other stuff on
47:13
it
47:13
so if you want to camp you can still
47:15
camp in the mountain of spices
47:18
without fear of anything attacking you
47:20
or getting lost because you can't get
47:22
lost anywhere in heaven
47:25
you're in heaven
47:30
so this is where he was going he was
47:31
going on a hunt
47:34
he was going on a hunt and i saw him the
47:36
whole time see they talk about you all
47:37
the time in heaven
47:38
they talk about all the fun things you
47:40
did the things you love to do together
47:42
you still get to do those things in
47:43
heaven
47:44
and so he was excited about his siblings
47:47
and his father
47:48
knowing about this this hunting trip he
47:50
was going on
47:52
and so he's starting up the mountain of
47:54
spices
47:55
and i see these creatures almost
47:57
transparent
47:59
peeking around some of the trees and
48:02
they had a scope camera
48:06
well he was hunting now
48:09
they were hunting him
48:13
[Applause]
48:14
and the father said hunting will take on
48:16
a whole new meaning
48:23
so that's how i learned about that that
48:25
they do that in heaven
48:27
and so i saw him i'm doing i started
48:29
doing other things i saw him
48:31
another time in his mother's mansion
48:34
which is right next to his father's
48:35
mansion
48:37
and on the walls of that mansion i saw
48:40
siblings that hadn't even been born yet
48:43
i saw family pictures of the i knew who
48:46
the father was i recognized the father
48:48
i didn't haven't really seen his wife
48:50
anywhere and you know when he traveled
48:52
or whatever
48:53
but i saw the father the mother i saw
48:54
him i saw another sibling and i saw
48:56
others that hadn't ever been born yet
49:00
god knows who he's going to send and
49:03
while this is
49:04
this is exciting i know how many more
49:06
she's going to have
49:10
and so you have precious things captured
49:13
memories and things put in your mansion
49:16
so if you ever wanted to take a photo
49:18
and you missed it and said man i wish i
49:20
had taken it the angels take it
49:22
they print it they frame it and they put
49:25
it in your mansion
49:26
[Applause]
49:29
and i had to give up that gift to do
49:30
this that was my gift
49:32
i am a photographer so he used a
49:35
business person to do all this
49:37
i'm the ceo of a company he used a
49:39
business person to reveal this stuff
49:42
he likes business people
49:46
they think clearly they're not afraid to
49:48
make plans for the future
49:50
they they make sure that they line on
49:52
everything to see what they need and
49:53
that it gets done they make sure the
49:55
people they hire
49:56
have the gifts and the things that they
49:57
need they have strategies
50:01
they have excitement they have
50:03
creativity
50:05
they don't mind connecting and
50:06
contacting with other people
50:09
no matter what they believe they're not
50:11
afraid to go talk to people
50:13
so business people like his son
50:16
master carpenter and paul the tent maker
50:20
and luke the physician all them they
50:22
were in business
50:24
so you need to be in business i'm
50:27
serious
50:27
god in this day will have more
50:29
entrepreneurs in the body of christ than
50:31
in the world
50:34
or you'll be a part of a business or
50:36
company that's headed up by somebody
50:37
like that
50:39
it's coming and so i saw the stuff going
50:43
on
50:44
and so i went and wrote everything down
50:45
i saw and heard
50:47
i typed it and i brought it typed when
50:50
he came to speak
50:52
now i didn't get to hear him speak
50:53
because i was in the kitchen
50:55
i was hospitality and i was preparing
50:57
all his meals and decorating the room he
50:59
would eat in
51:00
and i went up to my my pastor and i said
51:03
um
51:04
this is what got my pastor knew i was
51:06
going to heaven all the time
51:07
and i said oh i said this is what i saw
51:09
and he said you need to give this to him
51:13
they need this word desperately
51:16
it changed their life forever because
51:19
number one they didn't believe what
51:21
anyone else was saying
51:22
about their son being in hell because
51:24
not only
51:25
i did not know this but they actually
51:28
lived their actual home is in the
51:30
mountains
51:32
and the thing that they did the most
51:33
together was hunting
51:36
now i didn't know that about them at all
51:39
and so
51:40
god already see that's this is the
51:41
evidence he gives that their loved ones
51:43
are doing things as they always did down
51:45
here
51:47
and i didn't know any of this so this is
51:48
what they knew that i had seen
51:50
their son and the wife was so healed she
51:53
wouldn't even go out in public anymore
51:55
because of the accusations and i want
51:57
you know what the body of christ needs
51:58
to stop
51:59
doing that
52:02
no matter what happened or how it
52:05
happened
52:05
you need to have compassion on those
52:07
people because if it happened to you
52:10
you would want compassion given to you
52:12
amen
52:14
so yes there's all kinds of fun amazing
52:16
things to do in heaven
52:18
and they are never bored they are filled
52:21
with the light and the love of god
52:23
they're excited about us about us who
52:25
are on this earth right now
52:27
because this is our time to shine like
52:29
the stars in the heaven
52:31
where even when we go outside at one
52:33
point the night will be like
52:35
light about us the word says that we're
52:38
that generation that will experience
52:40
that
52:42
i know that the word says there will be
52:43
a generation which is a group and type
52:46
of people
52:46
that will be on the earth that will
52:48
taste of the powers
52:51
of the age to come the next age
52:55
after this age is the millennial age
52:59
and the powers that will be present then
53:02
for the people is that they will live to
53:03
be hundreds
53:05
and hundreds of years old christ will be
53:08
sitting on the throne his life will
53:09
permeate the entire earth
53:12
just like back in the ancient days in
53:14
the old testament days
53:16
you know they lived to be five six seven
53:18
hundred years old
53:21
so when christ sitting on the throne it
53:22
will begin to change the earth
53:24
heal the earth there will be many
53:26
millions of natural people
53:28
on the earth that didn't take the mark
53:29
of the beast nor did they die
53:32
in the tribulation and people will still
53:35
have children
53:36
in that time in heaven you don't have
53:40
children
53:42
but if you never had one god has a place
53:46
in heaven called the reserve
53:49
of babies if you never had one
53:53
you can go pick one out it'll be
53:57
you will be its mother its father you
53:59
can see it grow
54:01
step into its destiny its true destiny
54:03
is to use the gift god
54:05
your ultimate destiny for everyone
54:08
sitting here
54:09
not necessarily what you do for a job
54:11
aren't you glad
54:14
it is the gift he made you to be so even
54:17
when children go home to heaven they
54:20
will not miss their destiny
54:22
their destiny has not been stolen from
54:25
them
54:26
because their ultimate destiny is to
54:27
grow up and be the gift he put in them
54:29
their gifts are
54:30
their gifts and callings are irrevocable
54:34
and they will step into that and use
54:36
that in heaven
54:37
so if you're if you're one of those
54:39
who's lost a baby or lost a child
54:42
or a youth don't sit there and think
54:44
that their whole life was taken away
54:46
from them
54:47
they're living in the most glorious
54:49
place having the most fun they've ever
54:50
had
54:51
with friends going all over heaven
54:53
without parental guidance
54:57
isn't that the best of the best going
55:00
places doing things with jesus
55:06
he has all of your children
55:09
he has all of your babies
55:12
they're filled with life they laugh they
55:15
play
55:16
even they get to create things the
55:19
greatest levels of creativity
55:21
and technology are in heaven and some of
55:24
those
55:24
technologies that i saw in heaven are
55:26
literally going to be in this earth
55:28
because this is the time for heaven to
55:30
invade the earth
55:32
people are saying things they don't
55:33
understand how powerful that is what
55:35
they're saying
55:36
heaven is coming to earth heaven is
55:38
invading the earth
55:39
do we say that on earth as it is in
55:42
heaven is one of the most profound
55:44
statements anyone is making
55:47
because that's a lifestyle it's a
55:50
culture
55:51
it's not just sounding good
55:54
your will being done on earth as is in
55:57
heaven is a culture
55:58
it's a way of life called heaven culture
56:04
so we who are alive now get to live in a
56:06
way never lived before
56:09
because this is the time where we will
56:11
manifest demonstrate
56:12
speak to the earth the sky the sea it'll
56:15
be healed because of the glory we carry
56:19
we'll step into time and go forward in
56:21
time
56:22
we'll see things forward in time we
56:25
won't be bound by time or space
56:30
because christ wasn't and everything i
56:33
say will point
56:34
right back to him the things he did
56:38
we will do but you have to get your head
56:42
get your head and put it on the shelf
56:44
and open your spirit realize he said
56:45
greater than
56:49
so he actually saved the best for us to
56:53
do
56:55
so get off your rapturog roll it up
56:59
and stick it in the closet
57:02
the holy spirit laughs every time i say
57:03
that
57:06
because that's the first place i heard i
57:07
heard him say it to me when i was saying
57:09
were people trying to figure out and
57:10
figure out in their natural mind
57:12
everything that was being said i said
57:13
you don't get revelation that way
57:15
your spirit receives the things of the
57:18
spirit so if you're if you're sitting
57:21
there trying to figure out the first one
57:22
you missed all the rest of them
57:25
revelation is sent by god and there's
57:28
different revelations he sends for
57:29
certain times on the earth
57:31
so you're hearing new things you've
57:32
never heard about before or it wouldn't
57:34
be revelation
57:36
so i'm not going to be normal i'm not
57:39
going to look
57:39
normal i'm not going to say normal
57:42
things
57:44
that would be the same oh samo
57:47
and god's not old he is new
57:50
all the time so if you're going to hear
57:53
about heaven it should be things you
57:54
never thought of
57:56
or heard of before but not just in
57:58
heaven
58:00
but on this earth the greater works
58:05
he's not coming to rescue people and
58:06
take them out here we haven't even done
58:08
the greater works
58:09
we're still trying to do the first works
58:15
so god has given revelation on many
58:17
things that we know are in the word but
58:19
we don't necessarily have
58:20
understanding so he's revealing
58:22
mysteries
58:24
i love his mysteries when he gives me
58:26
one i get someone done like a little kid
58:29
why didn't i see that why didn't i think
58:32
of it that way why didn't i see it that
58:34
way and he said because your thoughts
58:37
aren't my thoughts
58:38
but you can have my thoughts
58:42
and you need to walk in my ways i didn't
58:45
realize how many times it said that in
58:46
the word even in the old testament
58:48
he was telling people you need to walk
58:49
in my ways you need to know my ways
58:53
because they're not man's ways
58:57
his are different they're unusual
59:00
they're amazing fantastic life-changing
59:05
they'll get you undone just like isaiah
59:07
got undone
59:09
i know how he felt when he had that
59:11
experience you have no words to even say
59:14
anything about it
59:16
when you stand before him when you see
59:18
that throne you see the living creatures
59:20
massive and huge with thousands of eyes
59:22
in their body and in their wings
59:25
worshiping them continually the throne
59:27
room is round
59:30
the throne goes up like this
59:33
like a pyramid
59:36
with different levels and the throne is
59:39
at the top
59:41
that's why satan stole that image
59:47
yeah almost everything he's told
59:49
anything he says is his he stole it
59:52
that throne goes up like levels and
59:54
there's columns and levels and columns
59:56
and levels but all goes like this
59:59
and the throne is high and lifted up and
60:01
there's four sets
60:03
of steps that go up to the throne people
60:06
are all over them gifts are all over
60:08
them for the lord and for
60:09
the father just gifts thrown up the
60:11
steps the river of life flowing down
60:13
these steps people are laying at the
60:15
bottom drinking it
60:17
sometimes he floods the throne room with
60:19
it and you're swimming in it
60:22
sometimes he opens the throne room floor
60:24
and you literally see the river of life
60:26
that goes down the streets of gold
60:28
and then people jump in it
60:32
it's a structure there's rooms under the
60:35
throne
60:37
that are under the altar where the souls
60:39
go in there and they're under the altar
60:41
crying out and we've always pictured
60:44
them like here's the altar you know i
60:46
know what altars look like
60:47
and i've always pictured people crammed
60:49
underneath these altars like how many
60:51
can you fit
60:54
because it says they cry out under the
60:56
altar but that's because the altar is up
60:58
here by his throne
60:59
and there's rooms that you go into under
61:01
the throne
61:03
and even people go in there to clear
61:04
over their families
61:07
and people go in there and they they
61:08
declare they worship
61:10
they they say things over their families
61:13
they bless their families
61:15
but there's people in there always
61:16
crying out for justice
61:19
and if you ever walked up the steps of
61:21
the throne they're very high
61:23
very wide i clearly can so clearly
61:26
embedded in my mind is the word justice
61:28
like this big
61:30
it's one of the steps of the throne
61:33
justice is one of the biggest things
61:34
we're going to get in this time as the
61:36
body of christ
61:39
justice against what the devil has done
61:41
to us for generations and generations
61:43
and generations
61:45
[Music]
61:47
to unseat him from where he put himself
61:52
the righteous have learned he has no
61:53
right to be there
61:56
we were given dominion in the earth he
61:58
was not he took it
62:01
christ won it back for us
62:04
so we're supposed to be like him we're
62:06
supposed to be different
62:08
we're supposed to be powerful we should
62:10
be fierce
62:11
against the darkness because the violent
62:14
take it by
62:18
force
62:21
not the lazy
62:25
not the ignorant
62:29
not the ones who don't care the violent
62:34
from the time of john the baptist that
62:36
wild man who was shouting in the
62:38
wilderness
62:39
repent of your sins you wicked people
62:42
the kingdom of heaven is a hand
62:46
repent and get baptized in water do you
62:48
know how weird that was
62:50
you talk about bizarre at least i don't
62:54
wear camel hair
63:01
[Laughter]
63:08
what time what
63:11
oh no but my husband has threatened to
63:15
buy me a camel costume
63:19
so every time someone says god does not
63:21
use pink hair
63:23
i show up with the camel
63:27
okay would you rather see this or the
63:30
pink hair
63:34
i've had many pastors say god does not
63:35
do things like that he wouldn't do that
63:37
you know you need to know him more
63:41
because i know what the word says and at
63:43
least he's not trying to tell me to walk
63:45
around naked for two years
63:47
sleep on one side turn it over sleep and
63:49
cook my food on dung
63:52
pink hair is a lot better
63:57
and you know what they can't fight
63:58
against the word
64:00
i think john wore camel here is that
64:02
correct
64:04
well that was for that time no
64:08
and that way god never changes
64:12
he always does weird things to his
64:14
prophets
64:17
because he doesn't hide them
64:20
he makes sure you don't ever forget them
64:24
this is a marketing ploy for heaven
64:26
right here
64:29
and it works i get people saved on the
64:33
plane
64:33
in the airport security check-in
64:38
tsa
64:41
i get favor all the time in the airport
64:45
because i declare i do people even the
64:48
security people walking through the
64:49
airport recognize me now
64:51
they'll walk past me really quiet and
64:52
they'll just kind of edge me over like
64:54
they're going to interrogate me or
64:56
something
64:58
they do they come up with their badges
65:00
and everything they get me over where no
65:01
one kisses them they go
65:03
so what is god showing you from heaven
65:14
and then they'll just walk with me
65:15
wherever i'm going they're walking me so
65:16
uh it's okay
65:18
um and they'll say i know you're busy
65:20
and i know you got a plane to catch so
65:22
you can just talk to me while we're
65:23
walking
65:24
while we're walking
65:29
it's quite fun because they recognize
65:31
the pink hair
65:33
you can't hide
65:36
one day this will be normal
65:40
because heaven's invading earth
65:43
and everyone in heaven at one time or
65:45
another has highlights in their hair
65:48
if they have a big celebration in the
65:50
throne room everybody puts highlights in
65:52
their hair
65:54
they do it with light think really hard
65:57
about doing that
65:59
it's heaven culture because it's strange
66:06
but i can't tell you how many people
66:08
have said i love your pink hair
66:10
and it opens a conversation about jesus
66:12
christ
66:14
that they didn't expect so i leave them
66:17
in their soul with words they never
66:19
expected to hear
66:21
that he asked me to have this in person
66:25
so the world would know he loved them
66:29
and so i'm not bashing them or accusing
66:30
them or threatening
66:32
them i'm giving them life and they will
66:35
never forget that
66:37
[Applause]
66:38
and guess what it's too late to escape
66:41
because the anointing's already going
66:42
into them and the anointing breaks uh
66:47
so pink hair let you really see
66:48
anointing
66:50
green hair blue hair purple hair
66:52
whatever
66:54
they even put diamond dust in your hair
66:56
in heaven
66:59
it's beautiful isn't it and some people
67:02
are so afraid to
67:04
receive revelation and yet or they want
67:07
well i like a cafeteria it's a cafeteria
67:09
i'll take these revelations but these
67:11
are just too wild i don't want them
67:14
this is just too far out no i don't
67:15
think that's god
67:17
and when you miss him when you do that
67:20
because if he's anointed someone to
67:22
speak on his behalf and they live
67:24
what they speak you should pay attention
67:28
if they're sharing deception or if
67:30
they're living unrighteously
67:32
trying to tell you things from god i
67:33
wouldn't take anything from them
67:37
because their their souls been twisted
67:40
either to live in deception and believe
67:42
it and share it
67:44
and you can tell deception they always
67:46
end up by saying
67:47
that you don't need jesus christ no
67:50
matter what they start with it's an
67:51
anti-christ spirit
67:53
all the false religions are an
67:55
antichrist spirit but the deception
67:57
that is so released now into mainly into
67:59
the body of christ
68:01
because the world doesn't care the world
68:02
wouldn't need the deception they don't
68:04
know christ anyway
68:05
so he's hitting the body of christ with
68:07
deception and it sounds really good and
68:09
even plausible because
68:11
people can take the scriptures and make
68:13
anything out of them
68:15
and it can appear that it doesn't matter
68:16
whether you sin or not
68:18
you know or that god loves everybody so
68:20
much the earth and the fullness thereof
68:22
is here so he's taking everyone to
68:23
heaven they'll actually use that
68:24
scripture for that
68:26
that's not what the word says
68:29
or they'll say there is no satan there's
68:33
there's beings like him but there is no
68:35
real literal satan
68:37
well then jesus was blinded when he was
68:39
encountering them on the mountain of
68:41
temptation
68:44
he talked about him he was kicked out of
68:46
heaven
68:48
there is a being and i've seen him also
68:52
and his eyes are filled with death
68:56
but he's not red he doesn't have a
68:57
pitchfork
68:59
or a pointed tail
69:03
i think that image is to make him look
69:05
sort of like a cartoon
69:08
but he's not he's deadly he hates
69:10
everyone even his own demons he hates
69:12
them
69:12
he loves nothing or no one and his
69:16
greatest desire is to take everyone to
69:17
hell
69:19
so we need to be fierce about winning
69:21
people of course
69:23
but in this day we have a greater
69:26
revelation to do things in more powerful
69:28
ways and accelerate it
69:31
like be free stay free of everything by
69:33
losing stuff from your soul
69:34
the keys to the kingdom which you loose
69:37
on earth will be loosed in heaven
69:40
you don't have to keep not even a care
69:42
if you realize that you're having a care
69:44
you've been
69:45
being concerned about stuff and then it
69:47
goes into worry
69:49
and then it can actually turn into
69:50
sadness or even levels of grief
69:53
or despair you don't want that in your
69:57
soul so
69:57
if i even realize that i'm sad
70:01
i will loose that sadness from my soul i
70:03
won't keep it
70:05
you don't have to keep it we cast all
70:07
our cares on christ
70:11
one of my favorite scriptures another
70:13
one is luke 2 52
70:15
and jesus increased in wisdom and
70:18
stature
70:19
in favor favor
70:22
favor favor with god
70:25
and man is that what it says
70:30
yeah then we need to be doing that don't
70:32
we
70:35
when we take the word as truth absolute
70:38
truth and we begin to apply that to our
70:42
life you'll see your life
70:43
change even if you didn't have
70:46
revelation on it
70:47
and you just start applying the word not
70:50
just
70:51
reading it it's a life book
70:54
it's a book the way to live your life
70:57
but when we start applying what we're
70:59
reading
71:00
he then gives us revelation so we can go
71:03
from glory to glory
71:07
we have weapons we have been given
71:10
spiritual weapons
71:12
not earthly weapons we're not supposed
71:15
to fight against
71:16
people everybody say that
71:20
we do not war against the flesh
71:23
so why do we do it because we're
71:26
listening to the enemy
71:28
he wants to keep us busy fighting so we
71:30
will never come together
71:32
because then we will be deadly
71:35
he wants you dangerous but when you
71:36
begin to come together and operate and
71:38
rule and reign we will be
71:39
deadly to the plans of the enemy will
71:42
crush darkness push it out of whole
71:44
regions
71:46
he's going to have a miserable life
71:48
[Applause]
71:49
i want him miserable
71:55
i want him terrified
71:58
he's been doing that to us long enough
72:03
christ didn't walk in fear i love the
72:07
scripture fear not
72:08
take no thought for your life
72:12
if he holds it in his hand and you're
72:15
running after him
72:17
then nothing can take you out of his
72:19
hand
72:21
if he takes you home you're still in his
72:22
hand
72:23
[Applause]
72:28
it says the grave and death they have no
72:29
victory
72:31
right and people go well we'll know each
72:33
other in heaven no no death shouldn't
72:34
even touch you in your thoughts
72:38
life should be there not death
72:41
to be spiritually minded is life
72:46
so if you're focused on life and living
72:48
and giving life
72:50
and helping people to live and be
72:53
greater and do greater
72:54
then death will be far from you
73:00
i love what he said about john when he
73:03
said what is it to you if i let him
73:04
remain till i come back
73:07
they couldn't even kill him he's a good
73:10
example
73:11
of living life and sharing life the
73:13
first words out of his mouth was always
73:15
about life and love
73:18
his last great message love one another
73:21
they didn't want to hear they want to
73:22
hear mighty mysteries they want to hear
73:24
more revelations of heaven
73:25
but they brought him out on the litter
73:26
what did he say
73:29
love one another we need to do that more
73:33
too
73:35
the more we focus on living and being
73:39
something and doing something for god
73:40
we're agreeing with him
73:42
when you agree with him that is powerful
73:47
the world should see as powerful they
73:50
should see us
73:50
loving helping and caring one another
73:53
even more than we do the world
73:55
it says to consider those of the
73:57
household of faith
73:58
first does it say that
74:02
then we need to stop fighting each other
74:06
lay down your differences you're going
74:08
to live in heaven
74:12
you'll wish you did it sooner
74:17
i'm speaking to the pastors not just the
74:19
body
74:21
you're the example of god in your church
74:24
start acting like him
74:28
don't put fear in your people don't tell
74:29
them the end is coming buy see rations
74:31
and run to the hills
74:32
tell them to get rid of the rapture rug
74:34
let god decide when that happens get
74:36
your crown on
74:38
start reaching out to each other and
74:40
caring cross those denominational lines
74:42
or just wipe them out completely
74:44
[Music]
74:46
when the fire god begins to hit you
74:47
you're not going to care what the name
74:49
of your church is
74:52
[Applause]
74:54
the fire of god and the fear of the lord
74:56
will hit you at the same time
75:00
you crawl on your knees to love one
75:02
another
75:03
because you can't stand up
75:07
you forget what you were fighting about
75:15
christ set a wonderful example of loving
75:17
people
75:19
especially his disciples
75:23
he gave me a whole new picture of them
75:27
god took me back and let me see a life a
75:29
day in the life of christ
75:32
with his mary man
75:36
now this was like in the first year he
75:38
was with them
75:41
when he was still having to tolerate
75:42
them
75:46
the sons of thunder there was a reason
75:48
why they called him that
75:51
they weren't calling fire and lightning
75:52
down from heaven they were creating it
75:54
on the earth
75:56
because they fought over pretty girls
76:02
they were so full of themselves
76:06
they liked themselves a lot
76:10
and competed a lot even while they were
76:13
walking down the road to take the truth
76:14
in the gospel
76:16
behind the messiah
76:19
luke the great physician all his
76:21
patients were chasing him down the road
76:24
why did you abandon us you left us for
76:27
him
76:28
we need you you took care of us we need
76:31
we need you we we need you to take care
76:33
of us we're
76:34
sick don't you care about us and they're
76:35
all hobbling down the road after luke
76:38
the tax collector they were throwing
76:40
rocks in him
76:42
you better duck they didn't like him at
76:46
all so here's jesus with this these
76:49
these people that god had given him
76:53
you ever felt that way about the god the
76:54
people god sent you god sent to you
77:00
are you sure
77:03
because i don't think it sounds like you
77:06
it doesn't look like what i thought it
77:08
would look like
77:11
i have to pray even harder for my own
77:14
staff
77:18
can you open their ears so they can hear
77:21
simple things
77:24
[Music]
77:26
then when you think you got it made
77:27
they're all together he adds some more
77:31
that were harder than the first ones he
77:32
sent you
77:34
and god said i didn't make it easy on my
77:36
son
77:38
that's why he ran to the mountain to be
77:40
with his father
77:43
all the time
77:47
don't you ever feel like you got to get
77:48
away
77:50
christ's dead and on top of that his
77:53
family was always pursuing him
77:56
this is not what we thought you would be
77:58
doing
77:59
are you done
78:03
when are you coming home they didn't
78:06
want him for his revelation
78:08
they didn't even want him for the
78:10
miracles he did
78:12
i know they probably never asked him
78:16
where did you hear that that's amazing
78:19
wow
78:20
you raised the dad are you coming home
78:22
to make more wine from heaven
78:26
now we gotta work
78:29
your carpentry business it's going to
78:31
the dogs
78:33
don't you care about it does this sound
78:37
like
78:38
family
78:41
and jesus knew he was going to be about
78:43
his father's business
78:45
and he didn't go back home do you
78:48
realize sometimes they actually lived
78:50
with him when they traveled
78:51
so it wasn't like just going down the
78:53
road he had to listen to when they all
78:54
got together at the end of the day
78:58
and in the beginning what they said
78:59
wasn't good i know when you live
79:02
positively and deal with life and
79:03
someone starts talking negativity it's
79:05
like crushing you
79:09
it says don't be the friends of an angry
79:11
man
79:12
there's a reason for that you're going
79:14
to get filled your soul get filled with
79:16
it
79:17
well if you live with someone who's
79:18
negative every word that comes out of
79:19
the mouth is negative you begin to
79:21
you cannot bear it okay
79:24
i taught all my family to lose stuff you
79:26
better lose it because if you don't i'm
79:28
gonna know it
79:30
if you didn't ask for grace for that day
79:32
that's gonna show up too
79:36
no wonder jesus had to be filled with
79:38
god's grace as a child
79:42
it says so in the word as a child he
79:44
filled him with his grace god has grace
79:46
it's the abundant life grace that's at
79:49
his throne
79:50
of grace christ came to bring life
79:53
grace for eternal life but he also was
79:55
allowed to impart
79:57
abundant life because as a child his
79:59
father filled him with abundant life
80:02
therefore he can impart it but god gives
80:04
you infusion with you can impart it
80:07
he knew he's going to need that grace to
80:09
live with those men
80:13
and yet look how powerful they changed
80:14
the world
80:16
didn't they they became exactly what he
80:19
wanted them to become
80:21
took a while
80:24
but they had it in their soul they saw
80:26
him he was mentoring them
80:29
for three years gave his life and so
80:31
their his life into their lives
80:33
and was excited when they began to
80:35
travel through the spirit realm like
80:36
philip
80:38
and where john became love
80:41
he didn't just share love he became love
80:44
he was saturated with love
80:46
that's why he said the one that christ
80:48
loved
80:49
he didn't even give his name sometimes
80:51
he talked about love poured love into
80:53
people all the time
80:54
that's why people were drawn to him
80:56
after christ was gone
80:58
he actually believed when he went to the
81:01
tomb
81:04
you know why he was the closest one to
81:05
jesus
81:07
he would not be apart from him
81:10
he wanted to hear every word he said
81:13
oh wow i can't believe time went by that
81:15
fast
81:19
the closer you get to christ the more
81:22
you're going to become
81:24
like him we cannot lead jesus out of
81:28
anything that we're doing
81:30
you wouldn't have any rights to do any
81:32
of this
81:34
you can't be a commander but we can't
81:37
because he was a commander
81:40
we can't be a creator but the father and
81:42
he both were creators
81:44
we can be creators
81:47
we are over time because they were over
81:50
time
81:51
we're over the weather because christ
81:53
was over the weather
81:55
he didn't mind demonstrating he was
81:56
trying to teach his disciples to do that
82:00
we can multiply food i've already done
82:02
that
82:03
at a funeral he has connected me too
82:08
he's so connected me to life after death
82:12
no one can ever tell me there's not life
82:14
after death there's more life after
82:15
death than you had down here
82:18
that's why we have to live on earth as
82:20
they live in heaven so people can see
82:22
life in us
82:23
[Applause]
82:28
christ was the lord of hosts this is my
82:31
last thing i want to share with you
82:33
it's about engaging with the army of
82:34
heaven i love the song
82:37
we're supposed to engage with the army
82:39
people think that's just too weird
82:41
we're not supposed to have anything i've
82:42
heard something you're not supposed to
82:43
worship angels
82:45
do you know where that came from back in
82:47
the day when the angels
82:48
were sent watcher angels were sent to
82:50
help educate mankind
82:52
god put them here because he had no one
82:54
on the earth to represent him
82:56
they had severed the relationship with
82:57
god so he couldn't teach him
82:59
himself like he was teaching adam
83:02
he literally put there's a whole tribe
83:03
of angels called watch your angels they
83:05
all have flesh
83:06
melchizedek is the head of that tribe
83:10
he also is the father's personal high
83:12
priest
83:13
he has always existed he wasn't someone
83:16
who lived on the earth died and went to
83:18
heaven became melchizedek
83:20
i know people believe that even some of
83:22
the jewish tribes believe
83:23
that he was someone who you know walked
83:25
on the earth but it said he has no
83:27
father no mother no beginning nor end
83:29
so there's still mysteries we need to
83:31
know about
83:33
but the hosts were created to protect us
83:36
to guard us to keep us in all our
83:39
ways
83:43
part of that taking power over all the
83:45
part of the enemy is using the host of
83:47
heaven
83:48
that army was created by the father in
83:51
detailed
83:53
tribes fierce they become weapons
83:57
they ship shape from their person into
83:59
weapons
84:00
when they go and fight the demonic but
84:03
he didn't need them to guard heaven
84:05
he was on the throne so why did he make
84:08
them
84:08
they waited for ages
84:12
to actually do what they're created to
84:13
do to be weapons in
84:16
our hands they those weapons
84:19
they are mighty they literally
84:22
can get ahold of the strongholds and
84:25
pull them down
84:28
we rule by what we say by the way we
84:31
live our life
84:32
like christ did he was a commander
84:36
and the lord of hosts when he spoke they
84:39
did it
84:41
does christ live in you
84:45
if we do the works he did and greater
84:47
works than he did
84:49
those angels were created for this time
84:52
and day we live in
84:53
for those who run in the kingdom who
84:56
live in the kingdom
84:58
who rule in the kingdom in that
84:59
spiritual kingdom there is a spiritual
85:02
army at our call
85:06
walking is a man a righteous man on the
85:08
earth christ said
85:10
to the religious hierarchy if i wanted
85:13
to
85:13
i could call the army of heaven to come
85:15
and fight on my behalf
85:18
are we joint heirs
85:21
of all that he had or did then why would
85:24
that leave them out
85:26
that's good they are bored
85:32
there was a time and day on this earth
85:34
that god said that said from this point
85:35
on
85:36
they will command an army like my son
85:39
commanded an army
85:41
because they are joint heirs i have
85:43
created them to protect them keep them
85:45
and all the way
85:45
till one day they won't even dash their
85:47
foot upon a rock
85:49
and nothing by any means shall harm them
85:52
you can fight against this revelation
85:54
argue about it this is something from
85:56
the father
85:57
you invite heaven's army to be your
85:59
weapon like you invited christ to be
86:00
your savior
86:01
and by the holy spirit to indwell you
86:04
heaven protocol
86:04
you have to invite they don't just come
86:07
on their own
86:08
generally in the past when we all pray
86:10
in groups they could come and do some
86:12
things
86:12
in general areas but this is the time
86:16
for us to be fierce to be focused
86:18
to crush the plans of the enemy to have
86:20
power over every
86:22
single power of the enemy and they are a
86:24
weapon
86:25
your weapons they are mighty to the
86:28
pulling down of strongholds
86:31
you need to pursue that you can say i
86:33
don't want it
86:34
and not do it but in this day of what's
86:37
coming on this earth
86:38
they will protect you and keep you
86:42
i have not been attacked at
86:45
all from the day the father came and
86:47
taught me how to invite heaven's army as
86:50
a weapon
86:51
and then give them orders to bring
86:52
destruction to the plains the enemy to
86:54
pull down strongholds wherever i go
86:56
send them before i go somewhere so that
86:58
nothing will hinder me haunt me or get
87:00
in my way
87:05
you can think about it pray about it but
87:08
i know about revelation
87:11
you don't just hear it you do it
87:16
the work of the lord you don't just hear
87:18
it
87:19
you do it when you rule and reign you
87:21
don't talk about it
87:22
you do it if you're going to be violent
87:25
against the enemy you can't just keep it
87:27
inside and go i'm so upset and angry
87:29
you do something about it
87:36
so stand up i'm going to pray over all
87:37
of you
87:45
father i declare and decree that these
87:49
children of you're standing here today
87:51
that you open their ears to hear
87:55

88:06
them
88:06
let them see them in the sky let them
88:09
see them sitting beside them
88:11

88:16
because they were sent from headquarters
88:18
[Music]
88:19

88:23
commander because he was a commander
88:26
we are supposed to be commanders god
88:29
said command ye
88:30

[SPECIAL]Kat Kerr URGENT PROPHETIC AMERICA: OPERATION RESTART | April 21, 2021
by Sermon For You April 21, 2021
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLANiArcpU
or https://youtu.be/kBLANiArcpU

00:00
thought i would talk a little bit and
00:01
then maybe jen could come up with some
00:03
questions because you know we get them
00:04
all the time
00:06
either about heaven or something else
00:08
but um yeah i'm so filled with god right
00:10
now after doing that interview it was
00:12
very powerful
00:13
and so i thought i'd talk some more
00:15
about the restart of america which is
00:17
still continuing
00:18
and i know some places is a little bit
00:20
slower than others
00:21
uh we're having really a great response
00:24
from our governor
00:25
here in florida so we're really excited
00:27
about that we're praying for others who
00:29
aren't really maybe getting the same
00:31
response from theirs
00:33
just remember on election day who you
00:34
vote for next time
00:36
and i just want to encourage you that
00:38
that we're hearing more and more things
00:41
are being reopened
00:42
and then the reopening is being expanded
00:45
to
00:46
like more people able to attend and
00:47
stuff like that i don't think they're
00:49
quite ready to do mass
00:51
crowds meeting together for big events
00:53
and stuff like that so i'm sure a lot of
00:54
people are being affected by that
00:57
i'm sure that that was not easy for any
00:59
of them
01:00
and i know many people try different
01:02
things like drive-by church
01:04
you know online church was amazing
01:07
yay dede and david in colorado at um
01:11
up on lookout mountain they did a great
01:12
job i think they broadcasted every
01:15
single night
01:16
since the quarantine happened they're
01:18
still doing it and they're still
01:19
doing it and that would be um gateway on
01:22
mount zion gateway on mount zion
01:25
online you can go yeah their facebook
01:28
page or their website
01:29
their website in uh yeah gateway on
01:32
mount zion in
01:33
golden colorado they're really powerful
01:36
and i know there were many others who do
01:37
that i just happen to know
01:39
that they are one of them and let me
01:41
tell you god is going to be
01:43
really be visiting places it was a
01:46
wonderful thing
01:47
the day the holy spirit invaded our
01:49
earth
01:50
and let me tell you he is my best friend
01:52
make sure you know him well
01:54
he will share things with you to come
01:56
he'll give revelation on the word of god
01:58
he'll tweak your life all day long and
02:01
jen and i both know he does that with us
02:04
he'll even go shopping with you and tell
02:06
you the best deals to get and
02:08
honestly i'll even go to get something
02:09
like i want to pick apples out
02:11
he'll actually tell me don't get those
02:12
get these other ones are going to taste
02:14
better
02:14
it depends on how much you open yourself
02:16
up to him you know he's the third member
02:18
of
02:19
passing that's what god's been saying is
02:20
just going to pass on
02:22
and there will be no second wave he has
02:25
assured me of that many times so i hope
02:27
that encourages some people
02:29
and i know in other countries people
02:31
really also been praying to god for many
02:33
things
02:33
that they need help with and we pray for
02:36
people
02:37
all the time to be touched by god to be
02:39
ministered for resources to come
02:41
for help to come to different people and
02:43
you know i know to some people it looks
02:45
like utterly impossible don't say it's
02:47
impossible
02:48
you need to stay with god all things are
02:51
possible and begin to thank him for the
02:52
things you need
02:54
if you've been praying and asking him
02:55
that's fine but start thanking him for
02:57
these things
02:58
it says call those things that be not as
03:01
though they were
03:03
that means you talk about them like
03:05
they're already here
03:06
that's called faith so i want to
03:09
encourage everybody
03:10
i hope your faith has been increased
03:12
during this time
03:13
and i know this is something probably
03:15
most people will never forget
03:17
of course there'll be generations coming
03:18
behind us that don't know anything about
03:20
that
03:21
but i think this has been a very
03:23
different time
03:24
and and hopefully the best part of you
03:27
has come out during this time
03:29
don't forget to pray and reach out to
03:31
others there are many people
03:33
who we may have less of things but let
03:35
me tell you there's some that have
03:36
nothing
03:38
and my dad's heart was always to help
03:40
those kind of people we spent years and
03:42
years
03:42
helping people feeding them finding them
03:44
clothes finding them jobs
03:46
finding houses for them that was just
03:50
put in me
03:50
and so that's my heart is to be help
03:53
people
03:53
be generous you know and sometimes be
03:56
generous even when you need something
03:57
yourself
03:58
that touches the heart of god when you
04:00
give out of your own need
04:02
it really does touch god's heart and i
04:04
know that right now he's got great
04:06
things prepared for all of us
04:07
i just finished saying that in our
04:10
interview with steve schultz of elijah's
04:12
i'm going to encourage everyone out
04:14
there if you are not signed up
04:16
to elijah list.com you need to go
04:20
do that because he has the proven
04:24
prophets you'll hear words from prophets
04:26
some you know some you don't know
04:28
and then you can watch and see what god
04:30
does once they have spoken and declare
04:32
things
04:34
he's had me on there several times just
04:36
discussing things prophesying things god
04:38
has said
04:39
and he won't let people come on there if
04:41
all they want to do is bash and bring
04:43
doom and gloom and death and destruction
04:45
this is not the time for that to happen
04:47
in this earth
04:48
these are the greater days of god and so
04:51
i really want to encourage you
04:53
keep declaring that the restart
04:55
operation restart will be fully taking
04:57
place
04:58
and that people will be able to go back
05:00
to somewhat of a normal life i hope it's
05:02
not going to be normal as far as god is
05:04
concerned i hope you've increased your
05:06
relationship with your family
05:08
and with him and then get ready for some
05:10
awesome things to begin to happen
05:13
for all of us and that we also pray for
05:16
people in other countries god i thank
05:18
you
05:18
for helping to bring supply to those
05:21
countries that don't have supply
05:24
we speak against and take authority over
05:26
any of the virus right now we won't
05:27
tolerate the virus even anywhere on the
05:29
earth in jesus name
05:31
we are over sickness and disease we are
05:33
not under it
05:34
christ was never upset he was never
05:38
controlled by any form of sickness or
05:39
disease when he walked down this earth
05:41
and you shouldn't either he didn't have
05:44
to put up with lack
05:45
okay with violence he didn't have to put
05:48
up with um
05:50
any forms of oppression or depression he
05:53
didn't keep
05:53
in him and he didn't participate with it
05:56
and make sure you're saying that
05:58
yourself
05:58
there's people out there right now if
06:00
you're oppressed don't tolerate it
06:02
loose it out of your soul get rid of it
06:04
don't let it control you don't let fear
06:06
control you
06:08
because this is not going to drag on for
06:10
years and years and why am i saying that
06:12
because i was in the grocery store the
06:14
other day and the person just
06:15
you know just ringing up my my supplies
06:19
they were saying that their self oh i
06:20
just think this is going to last for
06:22
years what are we going to do we don't
06:23
have any kind of a life and i said well
06:25
that is not correct this is for a very
06:28
short time
06:29
it's going to pass and then your life
06:31
will begin to
06:32
increase again so anywhere i can give
06:36
hope or encouragement to people i'm
06:37
going to do that
06:39
that's what we're supposed to do and so
06:42
thank you for all your prayers and all
06:43
you guardians i want to thank you so
06:45
much for your support
06:47
you have blessed our hearts you've
06:48
blessed the heart of god
06:50
every chance i get i'm going to make
06:52
sure i thank them
06:53
and we have so many more things coming
06:57

07:07
the studio is all set up
07:08
we're gonna we're gonna go ahead and
07:10

07:12
some questions that she can ask me
07:16
we've been trying to figure out why the
07:18
internet was sticking so
07:20
and i do know you know that we've had
07:22
some issues here techno
07:23

07:25
stuff here that i don't understand
07:26
yeah i don't understand that at all i
07:29
just know that i know how to talk and so
07:31
that's
07:31
my part and we do take authority over
07:34
and we're not towering the enemy getting
07:36
in any of our systems
07:37
frequencies technology whatever it is
07:39
we're kicking him out in jesus name
07:41
because i know people are probably out
07:42
there praying now i'm in agreement
07:44
with every one of you and so we want to
07:46
have a great broadcast and a signal to
07:48
be strong in jesus name
07:50
so what do you have today jen for a
07:52
question well i just asked everybody on
07:54

07:58
we're gonna we're gonna do a short
07:59
q a so we're gonna let you see our
08:01
little intro
08:03
we're gonna
08:24
so
08:33
okay we're ready for our q a but
08:36
before we start i already have a
08:38
question that i was asked the other day
08:41
and jen just reminded me
08:43
people are asking about our 2020
08:46
calendar
08:47
i know the year is almost half over but
08:49
this isn't just about the months or the
08:51
days of the months
08:53
this is about revealing heaven and these
08:56
calendars we create are what god wants
08:58
he wants to reveal heaven to the earth
09:00
the spirit realm to the earth
09:02
the host of heaven the army of heaven
09:03
whatever it is he once revealed that's
09:06
part of our job
09:07
to reveal heaven to earth and so they
09:10
want to know about our calendar because
09:12
we've been talking about it lately
09:14
there's some fun activities in there
09:15
that you can do with us that interact
09:17
with us
09:18
and one happens to be this month that's
09:20
how this whole thing started this is the
09:22
calendar right here
09:24
i hope you can see it it's called the
09:27
world called heaven
09:29
and on the cover is an actual picture
09:33
of a place that exists in heaven
09:36
we all know about hebrews 12 1
09:39
that talks about the great cloud of
09:41
witnesses that are watching this from
09:43
heaven
09:44
this is one of the places they do that
09:46
this is called
09:48
the portal and they have them all over
09:50
heaven people come in
09:52
way here this is the doorway walk down
09:54
here they walk up steps
09:56
these are steps that go up here to this
09:58
opening you can see the opening right
09:59
there
10:00
and that's where people look down in
10:02
they can view the earth declare over the
10:04
loved ones
10:05
see things happening good things
10:06
happening on the earth
10:08
and they sing they go and sing to you on
10:10
your birthday
10:11
they they understand they get to see
10:14
weddings and babies being born and all
10:16
kinds of things like that
10:17
so this is a beautiful place that's
10:19
mentioned in the bible
10:21
i was taken to that place and so this
10:23
entire calendar
10:25
actually that's what this is about and
10:27
every month you see a place or a being
10:30
that is in heaven
10:31
and i'll show you one more and uh
10:34
but we have special days we put in here
10:37
we put some of our own days in here
10:39
what is not in here is satan's holiday
10:42
you won't see that okay we're not giving
10:43
him any place whatsoever
10:45
uh and so let me find one of the other
10:48
places there's so many i want to show
10:50
you
10:50
this is just awesome and most of these
10:53
places were places i personally was
10:55
taken to in heaven
10:57
here's one of somebody going home to
10:59
heaven
11:00
this is called the transport and this
11:04
woman
11:04
who you can see standing there with the
11:06
red hair she was 90 in her 90s
11:09
when she passed and when she stepped her
11:11
spiritual body stepped out of her body
11:13
this is what she
11:14
looked like young and happy she's very
11:17
happy
11:17
those are her two guardian angels about
11:19
to take her home to heaven
11:22
and then over here you'll find an
11:24
explanation at the bottom of the picture
11:26
over here you'll find an explanation
11:28
of what this picture is about so you you
11:30
get understanding not just
11:32
images and then like i said and at the
11:35
bottom of every month
11:37
we have a declaration that we make
11:40
like here this one says heaven
11:41
celebrates each time a believer comes
11:43
home
11:44
so you get this at the end of each
11:46
calendar month
11:47
we make a declaration like that for you
11:49
so it's very exciting you will see
11:51
places in heaven you never even dreamed
11:54
were there
11:55
we do still have some left but the
11:57
reason people want them
11:59
is because we have interactive days like
12:01
we have a day we said
12:02
uh tell people you know show us with you
12:05
wearing angel wings
12:07
and that was one of the days and but you
12:10
have to use the
12:11
email email address that is on the
12:14
calendar
12:15
for those interactive things we do still
12:17
have some left
12:18
so maybe for the next month or so we'll
12:21
have some
12:22
so you can find them on
12:24
revealingheaven.com
12:25
go to our website click on the store and
12:28
you'll see this calendar
12:30
there uh we are already in the in the
12:33
we are already right now creating to the
12:35
2021 calendar
12:37
and the one before this one which was
12:39
2019
12:40
was about the host of heaven we we
12:43
revealed
12:44
and introduced heaven's army
12:47
into the earth because the father had
12:49
asked us to do that
12:50
and so there's many other things in here
12:53
i'll show you one more this is called
12:55
the hall of knowledge
12:57
i'm not the only one who's been there
12:59
there's these beautiful towers made out
13:01
of emerald like they look like emerald
13:03
glass
13:04
you ride on roads of light through these
13:07
towers and that you can learn all kinds
13:10
of different things
13:11
the books actually show you the book
13:14
you would take the book out of the niche
13:16
and you lay it on this little table and
13:18
it opens up and shows you like a movie
13:20
of what's in the book
13:21
this is heaven this is not the earth so
13:25
if you're interested make sure you go to
13:27
revealingheaven.com you can ask for
13:30
on the web store on the web store and
13:32
then you can find the world called
13:34
heaven calendar
13:34
and they need to click on the correct
13:36
link that pertains to
13:38
where they live there's a link for
13:41
canada there's a link for the us and
13:44
then there's a link for all other
13:45
countries
13:47
because you know we ship internationally
13:49
around the world and they have different
13:51
costs for different um for shipping
13:54
and so that's why it's important you
13:56
click on the right one so your calendar
13:58
is not sent to the wrong country
14:00
and so there you go there's a little bit
14:02
of information from a question that we
14:04
got so what do you have next jen
14:06
um i have a question from eagle
14:09
eagle and um
14:13
they asked can our loved ones visit us
14:16
in our dreams how can our loved ones
14:20
visit us in our dreams the loved ones
14:22
from heaven eyes and right
14:23
yes that happens to many people
14:27
people have very vivid dreams and
14:30
i would have to say absolutely that does
14:32
happen
14:34
god speaks to people and visions and
14:37
dreams it says so in the bible
14:39
so that is possible for you to have a
14:42
dream
14:43
or even a vision of your loved one in
14:45
heaven
14:47
and actually some people have been
14:48
caught up to heaven while they were
14:50
sleeping and didn't realize that
14:52
and they have very vivid dreams of being
14:54
in heaven with their loved ones so
14:56
you know with god those things are
14:58
possible but absolutely
15:00
that is possible for that to happen and
15:02
sometimes it will happen like right
15:04
after somebody passes away
15:06
um i've heard of some people just
15:08
appearing briefly
15:10
in the room and waving sometimes they
15:12
don't say anything sometimes they just
15:14
say
15:14
i want you know i'm okay or i love you
15:17
and
15:18
i think that depends on getting
15:20
permission from the father
15:21
for them to get permission from the
15:22
father to do that i know people are so
15:25
undone
15:26
and overwhelmed when they first get to
15:27
heaven their whole head and heart is
15:29
just trying to take
15:31
in that glorious place of splendor
15:34
in heaven and of course the
15:36
relationships they have with people they
15:38
are
15:38
meeting the father and the son and holy
15:41
spirit just seeing the beauty that's
15:43
there
15:43
the things you prepare for them their
15:45
own mansion
15:46
they're just getting undone it's like
15:48
one gift every time they go somewhere
15:50
else it's something beautiful
15:52
but yes i do believe it's possible to
15:54
have dreams and visions
15:55
okay um i found this question
15:59
almost quite well not really humorous so
16:01
it's it's a good one
16:03
it's from dawn and she said cat do
16:05
angels ever
16:06
mess up like when someone gets in an
16:09
accident or something
16:11
is that them maybe not paying attention
16:14
or slacking off on their job
16:15
lol just always wondered about that
16:18
i don't think it's about an angel if an
16:21
angel messed up
16:22
it wouldn't be something to do with
16:23
rescuing somebody
16:25
or protecting somebody i think
16:28
so many different circumstances issues
16:31
in our own lives
16:32
you know the enemy will try to attack
16:35
anywhere that he
16:36
can make sure you're declaring and
16:38
decreeing against that happening make
16:40
sure that you're
16:40
involving the army of heaven in your
16:43
life um
16:44
make sure there's all kinds of things so
16:46
i have to say for sure
16:48
angels don't mess up on something that
16:50
would be that important
16:51
they probably you know you have to
16:53
realize these are real these beings have
16:55
real personalities like you and i
16:57
they all have souls they all have
16:59
emotions
17:00
and so i think sometimes maybe they're
17:03
not quite getting along
17:04
especially on an assignment i think they
17:06
would get maybe a harder assignment
17:08
given to them
17:10
i do know sometimes that does happen i
17:12
don't know how often but
17:13
like i said some people have stronger
17:16
personalities some
17:18
have really fun personalities i know
17:20
that there's some angels that are almost
17:22
like comedians and there's
17:23
others who are very focused and fierce
17:25
against the enemy
17:27
and that whatever their personality is
17:29
that that's definitely going to come out
17:30
in their assignments that god gives them
17:32
of course they're answerable to him the
17:34
thing about being an angel is
17:36
nothing is hidden god definitely knows
17:39
everything that's going on with them and
17:40
they live with him
17:41
so i think he has to handle that stuff
17:45
and i know um we always have new people
17:47
that come in
17:48
or people that haven't heard you talk
17:50
about stuff and people who've heard you
17:52
say
17:52
this stuff a million times but it's like
17:56
certain people need to hear it and i
17:58
really feel like
17:59
um i want to ask this question this is
18:02
from pam
18:03
and she said you may have addressed this
18:05
already please forgive me if it's a
18:07
redundant
18:08
i am a nurse you've mentioned we
18:11
will do the same work in heaven
18:14
there isn't any sickness or lack in
18:17
heaven
18:18
we all that um i know
18:21
i've done on earth uh
18:24
let's see what will i do for papa god if
18:27
my job
18:28
won't be needed well it's not your job
18:32
it's not your job that you do in heaven
18:34
nobody has a job it says actually says
18:36
you labor no more
18:38
what you do for a living is not what
18:41
you'll be doing in heaven
18:42
unless you've been using the gift he put
18:44
in you let's say someone who's a
18:46
recording artist and they're singing and
18:48
they're so anointed
18:49
they will be doing that in heaven but
18:51
they'll be doing it for everybody in
18:53
heaven for free
18:55
so it's probably your hobby or something
18:58
that is your passion
18:59
uh maybe even though you were a nurse
19:01
and you took care of people of course
19:03
there is absolutely no sickness in
19:04
heaven whatsoever
19:06
they don't need lawyers doctors nurses
19:08
there's all kinds of things they just
19:10
don't need them in heaven because that
19:11
stuff doesn't exist there
19:12
but somewhere in you he put a natural
19:15
gift
19:17
not a job okay those are skills i'm not
19:20
talking even about skills skills can be
19:23
learned but a gift is something he puts
19:25
in you and that's the thing you love to
19:27
do the most that's how you can tell what
19:29
it is
19:30
it says every good and perfect gift
19:33
comes down from the father of lights
19:36
that would be you
19:37
and when he made you in your little
19:39
spirit man
19:40
he placed in that spirit man a gift
19:44
whether it is an artist whether it is a
19:46
dancer whether you're going to sing
19:48
whether you're going to grow the best
19:49
flowers ever
19:51
whether you're gonna make the best i
19:52
don't know chimichangas
19:54
uh donuts whatever it is the culinary
19:57
arts
19:57
are absolutely i don't know where that
19:59
came from somebody probably likes them
20:01
i don't like them whatever whatever okay
20:05
baker's bakers are loved in heaven
20:08
because let me tell you
20:09
he gives you your own shop everything
20:11
you make it all make all the wonderful
20:13
stuff there's no gluten free
20:15
no weight gain i can just go on and on
20:17
yeah none of this stuff
20:18
you don't have to have keto you don't
20:21
have to eat keto
20:22
stuff at the same time and so they're
20:24
let me tell you there's fried chicken
20:25
there's pizza i've been to a pizza
20:27
parlor and haven't
20:28
had ice cream cones and everyone that's
20:30
their gift because that was their
20:32
passion on the earth and they knew that
20:35
it says your gifts and your callings are
20:38
without repentance and he will not
20:40
take irrevocable means he'll never take
20:42
it away that means if he put in you to
20:44
be an
20:45
artist yes and maybe you never actually
20:47
had a gallery or anything like that but
20:49
maybe all you want to do is sketch
20:51
you're a great sketch artist maybe you
20:53
you understand colors and stuff like
20:55
that
20:56
maybe you want to make pottery with your
20:57
hands but you don't do that for a living
20:59
but it's your
20:59
passion that's your gift it's what your
21:02
passion is maybe it was a drummer
21:06
and one grandson he started drumming on
21:07
everything before he was a year old we
21:09
knew he was going to be a drummer guess
21:11
what he still loves it
21:12
that's his gift when he goes to heaven
21:14
one day he'll be a drummer
21:16
that's not a job you don't have to labor
21:19
it's not something that you don't like
21:21
it's not something that's hard it's like
21:24
breathing you
21:25
love it so much so guess what and all
21:27
that i do
21:28
and all that jen does we are
21:30
photographers
21:32
my gift is i'm not going to be a
21:34
revelator in heaven okay i'm not going
21:35
to be a prophet in heaven
21:37
i'm not going to be those things i'm not
21:39
going to be any minister i'm not going
21:40
to do that i will be a photographer why
21:43
because i love it it is my passion from
21:46
the time i was little i'd make fake
21:48
little cameras with a box
21:49
and pretend i was taking pictures until
21:51
i got my first camera
21:53
and i have never stopped loving it i
21:55
already know in heaven i'll have a
21:57
studio come by and see me one day when
21:59
you get there
22:00
i'll take your pictures for free and
22:02
create beautiful stuff out of that
22:04
so that's what you'll do whatever your
22:07
hobby is
22:08
whatever your passion is it's in there
22:11
somewhere that's what you will be and
22:13
all your property will be designed
22:15
that's why there's amusement parks
22:17
there's rodeos there's all kinds of
22:19
wonderful fun things there
22:21
and every time someone comes home to
22:23
heaven there's something new and
22:25
exciting
22:26
to do but they're not working they're
22:28
not laboring
22:29
it is the most fun they've ever had in
22:32
their life so there that's a good answer
22:34
for those people
22:35
who don't know they keep sitting on the
22:36
pew their church this is what god says
22:39
all my people keep sitting on the pew of
22:40
their church trying to figure out what
22:41
their spiritual gift is and yet the
22:43
thing i want them to know the most
22:45
is what is their natural gift that i
22:48
made them
22:49
when i sent them to the earth because
22:51
when you get home to heaven
22:52
that'll be the most exciting thing you
22:54
do there yep
22:55
okay one more what's one more okay um
23:01
i've been screen shotting questions okay
23:04
um
23:05
back to uh the when you were talking
23:08
about the angels
23:09
um this one person didn't quite
23:11
understand her
23:12
her name is i want to say remy
23:16
home um she said how could they not get
23:19
along
23:20
there is no evil in the angels so i
23:23
guess she does she thinks they fight
23:25
no no no i'm not talking about fighting
23:27
like evil there is no evil there is no
23:29
hate
23:30
they don't do that in heaven but they
23:32
have personalities everybody has a
23:35
personality
23:36
okay and you have to understand angels
23:38
are spiritual beings
23:40
we're physical beings okay we both have
23:43
a soul
23:44
but we have to make our we all get to
23:46
make our own decisions
23:48
because you're a believer and you're
23:50
going to heaven doesn't mean you
23:51
always you don't ever have disagreements
23:54
with people
23:55
okay there is no anger no coveting
23:58
there's no jealousy in heaven
24:00
there's no wrath nobody fights nobody
24:03
hits somebody nobody does things
24:04
spiteful i'm not talking about that kind
24:06
of stuff
24:07
i forget sometimes to relate things my
24:10
answers to
24:11
heaven culture and not earth culture so
24:15
your mind is thinking
24:16
earth culture earth atmosphere earth
24:20
living
24:20
it's not like that in heaven but not
24:23
everybody wants the same thing even in
24:25
heaven but they still agree
24:27
to enjoy their self to have fun you
24:30
still have your favorite things your
24:31
favorite colors in heaven
24:33
that god doesn't take all that away from
24:34
you but there is no anger no wrath no
24:37
hating no spitefulness no coveting
24:39
there's no offense that part
24:43
that part of your your flesh emotions
24:46
because right now we're spirit man but
24:48
we still have our flesh when he talks
24:50
about your flesh lay down your flesh
24:52
right
24:53
that's not talking about you dying as a
24:56
person that's talking about your
24:57
opinions your rights your attitudes
25:00
your anger issues that's the flesh
25:03
that stuff is not there but people still
25:06
have their personalities their likes or
25:08
dislikes
25:09
and sometimes when angels are sent on
25:11
assignment god on purpose and this is
25:13
why he does it there's no marriage
25:15
between the angels they don't get
25:17
married on this earth we get married and
25:19
one of the things that he does with
25:20
marriages
25:21
sharpens the husband and wife that
25:23
doesn't mean
25:24
get you angry enough that you divorce
25:26
but it stretches us
25:28
right it makes us to come into agreement
25:30
on different things sometimes you know
25:32
we have to give a little
25:33
take to get you know we have to come
25:36
together in agreement
25:38
even as husband and wife but it
25:39
stretches it says
25:41
steal sharpen steel that's what happens
25:43
when you're married you sharpen each
25:45
other
25:46
you make each other care more understand
25:48
things aren't going to be perfect but
25:49
you're
25:50
you're willing to work it out in heaven
25:52
they don't have that so god has another
25:54
way that the angels get
25:56
stretched right and he sends different
25:59
personalities on assignment and i happen
26:02
to know this is true because two that
26:03
were assigned to me for a while
26:05
one was a comedian the other one was so
26:07
fierce
26:08
against darkness he wanted to talk about
26:10
being holy he wanted to talk about
26:12
crushing the enemy
26:13
that would be satan his plans the other
26:15
one wanted to make jokes because he was
26:17
funny
26:18
his personality was totally opposite of
26:20
the southern angels they
26:21
stretched each other every time they
26:24
were
26:24
with me they didn't get angry each other
26:27
so forget about the anger thing that's
26:29
earth thinking but angels have
26:32
personalities in heaven
26:33
and they like many different things and
26:36
they have friends amongst each other no
26:38
romance
26:39
okay they don't happen in heaven um the
26:41
angels who fell
26:42
tried that it didn't work so that's what
26:45
i'm talking about when i said you know
26:46
it's not like
26:47
your flesh getting involved i'm talking
26:49
about on the earth
26:50
when you loosen stuff from your soul get
26:53
grace for that day
26:54
and you work through your things you
26:56
don't get offended
26:58
you don't get in wrath um because
27:01
we have help from heaven okay one more
27:04
next question angel question and then i
27:06
have a question i have a 13 year old
27:08
um wow melissa wants to know
27:12
do we have the same guardian angel our
27:14
whole life
27:16
yes you have the same guardian angel
27:18
your entire life at the time you are
27:20
conceived
27:22
when life begins life doesn't begin when
27:24
a baby's born
27:26
life begins the time of conception and
27:29
from that moment your angel your
27:31
guardian angel or angels are sent from
27:33
heaven
27:34
they are will you your entire life
27:37
they are the ones who help bring you
27:40
home to heaven
27:41
when your body dies and your spiritual
27:43
body steps
27:44
out the first one you will see normally
27:47
will be your guardian angels and they
27:48
escort you home in a transport
27:51
all different ways you can be taken
27:52
chariots you can be taken to heaven
27:54
they will be with you the whole time
27:57
awesome okay
27:58
um charity's 13 year old daughter
28:01
her name is i want to say lyanna
28:06
but she would like to know can we ever
28:08
get kicked out of heaven
28:10
no but he's going to get kicked out of
28:12
heaven that only happened once and that
28:14
would be satan and all the angels
28:16
who fell with him they were the only
28:18
ones who'd been kicked out of heaven all
28:19
right they decided to go against god to
28:21
try to take over heaven
28:23
that was a long time ago and so he was
28:27
one third of all the angels in heaven
28:30
how about that that's crazy
28:31
chose satan chose lucifer
28:35
as their new leader and they all got
28:37
kicked out but
28:38
no one who goes there you're not going
28:40
to get kicked out of heaven okay
28:43
when you step out of your physical body
28:46
with your spiritual body
28:47
you already whatever things whatever
28:50
issues you had
28:52
whether it was anger against somebody or
28:54
you had
28:55
issues maybe you didn't even like
28:56
yourself all
28:58
that is gone okay those things you don't
29:01
carry up to heaven
29:03
the people you cared about the gifts he
29:06
put in you to use
29:07
that stuff remains with you and
29:09
excitement adventure
29:11
and all kinds of wonderful things are in
29:13
heaven but
29:14
you can't get kicked out of heaven
29:16
because when you receive jesus christ as
29:18
your savior
29:19
all the stuff all the sins in you get
29:21
wiped away
29:22
like they never happen don't let the
29:25
enemy remind you of your sins if you
29:28
repented of them all right
29:29
now even god can remember them because
29:31
you told him that you were sorry for
29:33
them
29:34
and so i can assure you that no one's
29:36
going to get kicked out of heaven
29:39
okay and um this is another one you've
29:41
answered before but i love to hear you
29:42
talk about this
29:44
um erica's brother she didn't say what
29:46
his name was but
29:48
he wants to know if there is hunting
29:51
in heaven this is a fun answer actually
29:56
that's why i asked it i think you know
29:58
jen knows a lot because she's heard
30:00
so many probably she's probably heard
30:02
every single time i went to heaven
30:04
and for those of you who don't know me
30:06
yes god has never stopped catching me up
30:07
to heaven yes he can do that because he
30:09
wants to no i don't choose to go myself
30:11
this is all free for all of you so you
30:13
understand
30:14
god caught people up to heaven in the
30:16
old testament
30:18
it says so he caught people up to heaven
30:20
in the new testament
30:22
without dying and he still does that
30:25
because he chooses to
30:26
and so she knows just about every time
30:28
he caught me up not in this physical
30:30
body it would stay behind you catch me
30:32
my spirit man my spiritual body that
30:34
looked just like me
30:36
but a lot better and so what was the
30:38
question
30:40
erica's brother now if there's hunting
30:44
in heaven
30:44
is there hunting in heaven you'd be
30:46
surprised what god has
30:48
uh has in heaven but it's the way he
30:51
does it this different
30:53
okay almost everything we have on the
30:54
earth is in heaven
30:56
except there's no killing no no harm
30:59
nobody gets injured uh none of that
31:02
happens in heaven okay
31:04
so um
31:09
i'm getting distracted today
31:13
is there like are you seeing angels
31:16
well there are angels all over in here
31:17
right now okay of course i could get
31:19
distracted just by the one that's behind
31:21
me and the one who's
31:22
two on here the one standing by you the
31:24
one standing by chris okay the one's
31:26
sticking their heads with the ceiling
31:28
looking down
31:29
and the ones looking through i'm gonna
31:30
figure
31:35
oh yes because you know i don't really
31:37
want to hunt
31:39
maybe well no we won't say that i don't
31:42
hunt i don't want to hurt anything
31:44
maybe mosquitoes there's hunting in
31:46
heaven
31:47
but this is the way god does it because
31:49
nothing gets killed remember what i said
31:52
no creatures are killed all animals are
31:55
called creatures in heaven
31:56
they all talk they all have actually uh
32:00
amazing personalities but you do go to
32:04
the mountain of spices that actually
32:06
exist in heaven
32:07
and what you do is a camera shoot
32:11
you're capturing the image and they
32:14
actually have a clubhouse in this whole
32:16
place
32:17
and you will be hunted by the creatures
32:21
with their own cameras while you're
32:22
hunting
32:23
them and your goal when you get to
32:26
heaven is to be the first one to get
32:28
their picture which is sent back to this
32:30
huge clubhouse with like a 40-50 foot
32:33
screen
32:34
and down in the corner is the one who
32:35
captured you and on the screen is the
32:37
one that was captured
32:39
and so all these people i actually saw
32:42
people in heaven doing that
32:43
they had you know pack horses and they
32:45
were packing all their camera equipment
32:47
on these horses
32:49
they even have different type cameras
32:52
that look like sort of like a scope
32:54
thing and when you
32:56
some of these creatures are not anywhere
32:57
on the earth by the way so you're really
32:59
hunting something that's fantastic
33:01
but more times than not
33:04
when you get back to the clubhouse you
33:06
will see your face plastered all over
33:08
the big screen
33:10
and in the corner will be the creature
33:11
who captured you
33:13
by getting that picture first so it's
33:16
very intense because while you're
33:18
hunting to find the creatures to get
33:20
their pictures
33:21
it's a camera shoot remember you're not
33:23
gonna hurt anything but
33:25
how intense is that
33:28
hunting process when you're looking for
33:31
something that's never been seen before
33:33
and yet they're probably smarter than
33:35
you they hide to you
33:37
and they get you first when you go back
33:40
thinking wow i know i snapped that
33:41
picture
33:42
and you walk in the clubhouse and
33:43
there's your face plastered all over
33:46
you know that you were busted and you
33:48
were caught
33:49
not them but the intensity and
33:51
excitement even increases more so in
33:54
heaven
33:54
but nobody gets hurt or harmed and no
33:57
life is taken
33:58
so you will still get to do that
34:01
try your best if you can when you get
34:03
there
34:04
okay i have a um another question you've
34:07
talked about before
34:08
but um holy spirit really wants me to
34:10
ask this so
34:11
um do aborted babies and babies in
34:14
general
34:15
have their own mansions especially when
34:18
they grow up
34:19
or if not where do they live
34:22
i brought this everybody everyone
34:25
no matter who they are will eventually
34:28
have their own mansion
34:30
jesus said in my father's house that's a
34:33
world by the way just you understand
34:35
god's house is the world called heaven
34:37
bigger than our
34:38
galaxy and uh trust me there's plenty of
34:42
room for mansions
34:44
and when little babies go home to having
34:46
every baby
34:48
who dies passes leaves this earth with
34:51
however you want to say it whether
34:53
through abortion
34:53
miscarriage or because they were sick or
34:56
whatever if when they die
34:58
and they go home to heaven they will
35:00
know family members in heaven
35:02
uh they will grow very slowly uh we've
35:06
actually
35:06
know of people who when they were 40
35:09
years old died on the operating table
35:11
saw their seven-year-old son playing in
35:13
the streets of gold who died years
35:14
before that
35:16
but because they the the mother went in
35:18
her spiritual body
35:19
her son recognized him he still looked
35:22
seven years old
35:23
he was playing with friends on the
35:24
streets of gold and he recognized her
35:27
and actually told her you can't stay you
35:29
have to go back but god allowed her to
35:31
see her son
35:33
number one he was well and whole he was
35:35
happy
35:36
he was playing he had friends and his
35:39
mom
35:40
came back of course she survived her
35:42
operation
35:43
and for years her and her husband would
35:45
travel around the world and tell people
35:47
about the beauty and the love of god
35:49
that their child was still waiting on
35:51
them in heaven
35:52
now she's already home in heaven so when
35:54
the parent comes home
35:56
to the baby they actually get to take
35:58
the baby from the nurseries and i have a
36:00
picture
36:01
here's one of the nursery walls that i
36:03
saw in heaven right here
36:07
and i gotta make sure that the lights
36:09
not reflecting tilt it down
36:12
oh here yeah there we go
36:15
that's good if you can see that these
36:17
are some of the babies beds that were on
36:19
this nursery wall i saw now they weren't
36:21
sleeping
36:22
babies don't have to sleep in heaven but
36:24
they have these beautiful
36:26
like a little niche these are little
36:27
tiny babies most of them
36:29
and the angels give them a nickname
36:32
unless the parents have named them
36:34
and they grow so slowly birds come in
36:37
and the birds take them for rides around
36:40
heaven
36:41
all kinds of fun things for them to do
36:42
they can sing laugh
36:44
dance and god has this beautiful place
36:47
for them
36:48
and they will be there until either the
36:50
grandparents come home or somebody close
36:53
to that baby in
36:54
relation they get to take them and keep
36:56
them to the parents get there
36:57
the parents take turns raising them and
37:00
eventually
37:01
they grow they step into the gift
37:04
remember we talked about gifts they each
37:06
have a gift
37:07
whether it could be anything designing
37:10
um
37:10
it could be like music it could be art
37:12
it could be dance it could be culinary
37:14
arts
37:15
it could be creating all kinds of gifts
37:17
and things for people
37:18
making things out of gems i know they
37:20
have jewelers and things in heaven
37:21
whatever their natural gift is
37:23
they'll still use that in heaven they'll
37:25
step into their gift and eventually
37:27
they will have their own mansion when we
37:29
come home to heaven we come home as
37:31
god's son
37:32
or daughter and all those babies will be
37:35
growing in the most beautiful amazing
37:37
place
37:38
loved by jesus himself and fun places
37:41
that he made for them so
37:43
your babies know who you are they
37:46
definitely can't wait for you to get to
37:47
heaven so that was beautiful you brought
37:49
that jen
37:50
okay um this question is
37:53
from jan vincent and he wants to know
37:58
if you can practice christianity and
38:01
witchcraft
38:02
no and what if you
38:05
you cannot claims that he pray for
38:08
people and heal people with jesus name
38:10
but yet also do witchcraft stuff
38:12
i will tell you what the bible says
38:14
there'll be some people who go there one
38:15
day and jesus will say depart from me i
38:18
never knew you
38:19
you cannot practice evil and
38:23
say you are a believer too you cannot do
38:25
both
38:26
when you become when you practice
38:28
witchcraft you're partnering with satan
38:31
even the bible talks about that it was
38:33
called necromancing
38:35
in the bible and it's all evil it
38:38
belongs to
38:39
satan witchcraft controls and i know
38:42
that one day they'll actually be
38:43
people that are called themselves good
38:45
witches there is no good witch
38:47
and i've heard from some of them myself
38:49
and let me tell you when you partner
38:51
with satan
38:52
he will lie to you deceive you but you
38:55
cannot you have to choose one or the
38:57
other
38:58
because christianity you believe in
39:00
jesus christ as your savior he does
39:02
not tolerate witchcraft he never
39:05
practiced witchcraft he spoke against
39:07
witchcraft
39:08
even himself in the new testament so
39:10
it's wrong it belongs to the enemy
39:13
and this is a thing people will get
39:15
healed in the name of jesus
39:17
it's jesus's name healing them but that
39:20
doesn't mean
39:20
they get reward for that and the bible
39:22
says will be people who come before god
39:25
there's also people who say they're a
39:26
christian but they sin
39:28
in bad ways they sin but they go hold
39:32
meetings people get saved
39:34
they'll get healed they may get words
39:36
from god
39:37
because that doesn't stop operating you
39:40
the way you choose your own life to live
39:42
and what you personally choose
39:44
yourself will be demonstrated by the way
39:47
you live your life that means you can't
39:49
be a witch and you can't belong to jesus
39:51
you have to choose
39:52
okay because when you die
39:56
whoever owns you or you serve
39:59
will come to get you and if you're
40:02
practicing witchcraft that gives the
40:03
enemy the right to come and get you when
40:05
you die
40:06
so i would not mess around with that get
40:08
witchcraft out of your life
40:10
i pray for people to be delivered from
40:12
witchcraft spirits
40:13
that doesn't come from god so don't play
40:16
around
40:16
don't read books on witchcraft don't go
40:18
see movies about witchcraft
40:20
you're opening a door in your soul for
40:22
the enemy to begin to control
40:24
you and these people who think they can
40:26
be do both
40:27
are under a great deception
40:30
so i'm just saying there's evil people
40:33
people who are doing wrong
40:34
sinning but going and having meetings
40:36
people come they get
40:38
saved by the name of jesus they get
40:39
healed by the name of jesus they get
40:41
worse because the holy spirit is going
40:42
to speak to those people
40:44
it isn't that person okay don't follow
40:47
people who you know
40:48
are sinning don't do it because you
40:52
follow jesus christ those who believe
40:54
the word of god and live the word of god
40:56
there's double accountability for
40:58
leaders and so he will hold them doubly
41:00
accountable but it says one day when
41:02
they come before him
41:03
and want the reward there will not only
41:05
be no reward he will not
41:07
allow them to remain okay
41:10
so you can't you can't do evil and do
41:13
god you have to choose god you cannot
41:16
have evil in your life
41:18
and witchcraft is one of those satanism
41:20
is witchcraft
41:22
any false religion don't try to practice
41:24
two religions at the same time
41:26
any witchcraft and you don't allow it in
41:28
you make sure you're running your race
41:30
to make a difference
41:31
for jesus christ it says for us to be
41:34
like him
41:36
he didn't practice any of that he
41:37
actually spoke against it
41:39
so those people are deceived there you
41:42
go
41:45
okay um this one's really long but i'm
41:47
not going to read the whole entire thing
41:49
and uh again you have discussed this but
41:53
um this is from charity um
41:56
herself and she says she has such a
41:58
struggle with being you know you can
42:00
share on this
42:01
experience i can share on this i
42:03
absolutely can share on this
42:05
and number one i want to let you know
42:06
this god does not approve of any
42:09
violence
42:10
no abuse okay no kind of abuse
42:12
whatsoever
42:13
whether it's physical abuse verbal abuse
42:16
god is against that
42:18
and and let me tell you this that he
42:21
would rather you be by yourself than be
42:23
with someone who's abusing you
42:25
i know that many spiritual leaders
42:27
through the years have said uh and it
42:30
can happen on both sides okay i'm not
42:32
saying i know women that were violence
42:33
and abuse their husbands and i know men
42:35
that were violent and abused their wives
42:37
it happened on both sides so you can't
42:39
say one is worse than the other
42:40
abuse is abuse okay uh but for instance
42:44
let's just say for instance
42:46
i had prayed for people before they were
42:47
under severe abuse
42:49
and this was a wife and she was abused
42:51
physically all the time and when she
42:53
went to her pastor they would say
42:55
you cannot leave your husband the bible
42:56
says you cannot do that
42:58
no that was not the right thing to say
43:00
to them okay god does not
43:02
put up with abuse he doesn't approve of
43:05
anybody abusing anybody you
43:07
certainly have the right to not be
43:08
abused and this is the thing
43:11
if it is sin let's just say it's sin
43:14
if we say it sin sins can be forgiven
43:17
if you divorced and it wasn't out of
43:20
abuse when you just divorced you didn't
43:21
want that person you
43:22
you divorced them you can go before god
43:25
and say i repent
43:26
of that that doesn't mean you have to go
43:28
back to the person you're already
43:29
divorced
43:29
your pen is wiped away sin is wiped away
43:33
people
43:34
you can't hold those sins against people
43:36
not even things they did 30 years ago
43:38
if they repented of those things then
43:40
god doesn't remember them anymore
43:43
and i happen to know myself personally
43:45
some people don't like me after i tell
43:47
them this
43:48
i went out and picked out somebody it
43:49
wasn't god's choice
43:52
this is what the bible says and god came
43:54
to me himself one day and i was abused
43:57
horribly uh when i was married to
43:59
somebody else and god came to me and
44:00
said how long are you going to put up
44:02
with that
44:03
and i said well what should i do about
44:04
it he said you have a contract you don't
44:06
have a covenant
44:08
he said my word says what god has joined
44:11
together
44:12
let not man put asunder what that means
44:16
is don't let man
44:17
end it he said if if god put it together
44:21
if it was god
44:22
who brought you together and then again
44:24
even if you did and you repented
44:26
for doing that later it's still forgiven
44:29
okay people don't like it when i say
44:30
that
44:31
sin is sin if you repent it's forgiven
44:34
no matter what kind of sin that is it's
44:36
it says that he remembers it no more
44:39
he's not going to treat you like a lower
44:41
human being
44:42
okay god's not going to do that i'm
44:44
still pursuing my destiny
44:46
i repented of that and uh god said end
44:49
the contract so we i got divorced
44:51
because god told me to
44:53
he said you'll never be who i need you
44:54
to be if you remain married to that
44:56
person i didn't bring you that person
44:57
that is not my choice
44:59
that's not a covenant a covenant is when
45:01
i bring you together
45:02
i didn't look for anyone god brought me
45:04
the husband i have now we've been
45:05
married 43 years
45:07
and let me tell you a marriage is a
45:09
trial
45:11
it's a trial it's a challenge because
45:13
you've got two individuals
45:15
coming together as one maybe you like
45:17
different things you do things different
45:19
ways make sure that you're marrying the
45:20
person god
45:21
has for you and even then there could be
45:24
conflict but make sure you're praying
45:26
for each other i'm just going to include
45:28
all this in this package that's not just
45:30
a yes or no thing
45:31
now yes or no abuse is as bad as
45:35
running around on your spouse it's still
45:38
abuse
45:39
that is mental abuse if you're married
45:41
and you go find someone else and sleep
45:43
with them and you you choose them
45:45
over your spouse and you're still
45:46
married and all this is going on
45:48
that is sin that is for sure sin but
45:50
it's abuse
45:52
god puts abuse in that same line that
45:55
says
45:56
that talks about adultery in that home
45:58
meaning
45:59
is severe abuse and that's what he
46:02
recognizes even in the bible
46:04
that you can be divorced if that happens
46:07
this is a very touchy question but i
46:08
don't mind answering it okay
46:11
i suffered a lot of abuse but put up
46:13
with it for six and a half years until
46:15
i finally said to god what do i do and
46:17
he said how long are you going to
46:18
tolerate it
46:20
i had to repent to the person i married
46:22
i didn't even love them i had to repent
46:24
to them
46:25
i'd repent for them that that had to be
46:26
ended because god had asked me to end it
46:29
so there was repentance on my side and
46:31
then god brought me the right person
46:33
and i married them because he said you
46:34
will marry this person
46:36
so people can fight and argue and yell
46:39
all you want to it's about
46:40
what you repent from if it was wrong
46:43
what you did it's been ended and it's
46:45
over
46:46
and maybe the other person is remarried
46:48
he certainly doesn't expect you to go
46:50
after them and make them remarry you
46:52
you repent for the whole situation give
46:54
yourself to god
46:56
and he probably most more than likely
46:58
will bring you
46:59
somebody else to be with you god doesn't
47:01
want us to be alone okay
47:03
and the reason why he has marriage is so
47:05
we don't have to go through this
47:07
life alone it says the marriage bed that
47:10
means you know what that means that
47:12
means a living together having physical
47:14
relations
47:14
when you're married god approves of that
47:17
when you're not married and you live
47:18
together and do that he does not approve
47:20
of that
47:21
and there's many reasons why because
47:22
when you come together
47:24
you're actually sharing your soul with
47:25
each other this is more than you ever
47:27
thought you were going to get this is
47:28
what happens when you ask the deep
47:29
questions okay
47:30
and the more of yourself you give when
47:32
you're married you're empowering each
47:34
other
47:35
but when you're not married and you're
47:36
sharing physical relations with each
47:38
other you're giving parts of your soul
47:40
away layers that you shouldn't be doing
47:41
that to someone you're not married to
47:44
so there's your whole story it's all
47:47
about
47:47
abiding in god married they're
47:49
christians and they marry someone who's
47:51
not it's a much
47:52
harder lifestyle if they don't want to
47:54
agree with what you're doing maybe
47:56
make sure you find that up before you
47:58
get married
47:59
but i can tell you that if anyone
48:02
repents
48:03
they are forgiven and you can't drag
48:06
that stuff up and throw it back in their
48:08
face again
48:09
because what you that is then wrong okay
48:12
you have to forgive too
48:14
even it was something that was done to
48:15
you that that unforgiveness will hurt
48:18
you
48:18
worse than what you experienced before
48:20
in your life
48:21
get rid of all unforgiveness and all
48:23
offense
48:25
no matter what it was and you run your
48:28
race
48:28
and let god bless you and so there's
48:31
that very long answer about that
48:33
question but god
48:34
doesn't tolerate abuse in any marriage
48:37
no physical abuse no mental or emotional
48:40
abuse
48:41
that beats you up until you feel like
48:43
you're nothing at all
48:44
he doesn't want you to stay in a
48:46
situation like that okay he doesn't
48:49
and so uh pray let god open doors of
48:52
safety for you
48:53
and you seek him to see what you're
48:54
supposed to do next
48:56
but he does love you there you go
49:02
so um somebody actually asked me a
49:04
question
49:05
oh wow jen what did they ask you they
49:08
wanted to know if i've ever been to
49:11
heaven
49:12
okay so come over here and say thank me
49:16
if they ask you then you give them their
49:18
answer
49:19
hey
49:22
i'm kind of in my gym clothes still it's
49:24
okay everybody looks like that right now
49:27
anyway so i've never
49:30
been to heaven but i have had um
49:34
three open visions uh during the time
49:38
that i was writing the
49:39
the first children's book and well two
49:42
times were with the first children's
49:43
book
49:44
and then the third time was during the
49:46
well
49:47
well i've been writing the second but he
49:49
did something special for you didn't he
49:51
yes um when i was writing the first book
49:55
i wrote one sentence down and i was in
49:58
my office and my whole office went black
50:00
and then my wall kind of opened up like
50:03
a movie screen
50:04
and i it was like i was seeing
50:07
the book come alive so it was all in
50:11
cartoon
50:12
form every time i've ever had an open
50:15
vision about heaven it's been in cartoon
50:17
form that's cool
50:18
and so i was seeing the characters in
50:20
the book and
50:21
walking down the streets of gold and um
50:24
one of the times
50:25
that that happened they were going into
50:28
the amusement park which
50:29
kat talks about in her first book and i
50:32
was seeing all kinds of things
50:34
um and things that i had never heard her
50:37
talk about and so it was like i was
50:40
walking with them
50:42
i didn't see myself on the path but i
50:44
knew i was walking with them seeing my
50:45
characters walking down the streets of
50:47
gold and
50:48
going into the amusement park and one of
50:51
the things that really fascinated me
50:53
which is going to be in the first kids
50:55
book is
50:56
i saw a merry-go-round and instead of
51:01
uh the horses that you sit on there are
51:04
actual
51:04
live animals and they were whole the the
51:08
people
51:08
children adults and there were even some
51:11
animals writing on there so it looks
51:12
like
51:13
animals it was quite funny um but they
51:16
were riding on the backs and they had
51:18
rains
51:18
and then instead of their little
51:20
platform yeah instead of a pole
51:22
being down the middle um they were on a
51:24
platform that would go up and down
51:27
and i had never heard her talk about i
51:29
didn't know that and so
51:30
i was so excited it went in when the
51:33
vision was over i come running out of my
51:35
office to tell her what i saw and
51:37
and she's like yeah that's up there so
51:40
um and there were other things that i
51:41
saw
51:42
too and what what were some of the well
51:44
or some of the animals you could write
51:45
on jen not what you would think
51:47
yes it is was
51:50
um dinosaurs there was even a whale
51:54
so apparently somebody had always wanted
51:55
to ride a whale i mean i guess it
51:57
it wasn't huge so it shrunk down to fit
52:00
on the merry-go-round but
52:01
there was a seahorse that didn't need
52:03
water to breathe no
52:04
it didn't it didn't and there was uh
52:07
jungle animals
52:08
uh you know like elephants and lions and
52:11
real ones
52:12
yeah real ones breathing ones and it was
52:14
really cool
52:15
and uh there was like a little raccoon
52:17
that was on the back
52:18
of i think it was like a hippo or
52:20
something it was so funny
52:22
but um yeah and they like lollipops
52:25
don't they
52:25
yes the raccoons like yeah yeah because
52:28
they even saw a raccoon riding on the
52:29
rush
52:33
yeah so that that was my experience and
52:35
it was it's happened three times now
52:37
yeah and uh so yeah that'd be awesome
52:41
yeah yeah that was a great answer i'm
52:43
back over here now
52:44
okay maybe a couple more questions so
52:47
that we can we do have a couple more
52:48
things
52:49
i have to do today but how much fun is
52:52
this to just have a
52:52
just a spontaneous q a session and now
52:55
you find out
52:56
some people can see heaven and cartoon
52:58
form that would be really cool
53:01
so oh let's see and so when you see like
53:05
you know
53:06
teal squirrels or or purple elephants
53:10
yes that exists in heaven everything is
53:13
different colors
53:14
in heaven i love when you talk about the
53:15
messenger squirrels
53:17
yes that we're talking the greeters the
53:19
breeders i've always called a messenger
53:21
squirrels
53:22
they're greeters they sing and dance
53:23
with top hats the squirrels when you
53:25
have a party somewhere in your home yes
53:27
people have
53:28
parties and they come to entertain and
53:30
they have top hats and canes and some of
53:32
the best dancers i've ever seen
53:34
and you you you just you know get home
53:37
and say hey we're having a party we'd
53:38
like for you to come do some
53:40
some of your performance you never know
53:42
what's going to happen up there it's
53:44
just great
53:46
so what would you say to someone who's
53:48
been praying and asking
53:50
to see jesus and angels and it hasn't
53:53
happened yet
53:54
i would say um stop praying and asking
53:57
and start thanking him
53:58
i'm real serious about that because it
54:01
happens at the most unexpected times and
54:04
it's usually
54:05
not when you're asking i'm just gonna
54:08
give you a free little tip
54:10
and many times it's not when you're
54:12
praying either
54:13
most of my encounters i have in heaven
54:15
is not when i'm praying
54:16
somewhere i'm not even reading my bible
54:19
i'm doing everyday stuff
54:21
and he catches me up and sometimes i'm
54:23
doing everyday stuff and then an angel
54:25
walk up
54:26
walk up and say something or i'll see
54:27
them doing things or
54:29
um so you have to just understand
54:33
you think if you don't get in some
54:34
spiritual position
54:37
of what you think would be proper then
54:40
it's not going to happen
54:41
jesus also visits me when i least expect
54:44
it
54:45
and so i would just say expect have an
54:47
expectancy
54:48
that is going to happen you know and i
54:51
you know maybe share to people i'm
54:52
expecting this to happen
54:54
and you'd be surprised how soon or
54:57
quickly it happens then
54:59
well i know the first time i saw an
55:00
angel which was
55:02
um um the one that was watching
55:07
uh ben do the shipping and receiving
55:10
yeah we've seen
55:11
i was working at my desk typing right
55:13
here in this room
55:15
and at the core of my eye i just see
55:17
this most radical looking angel
55:20
leaning he's just like like this
55:22
watching him
55:23
pack up the products to ship out and i
55:25
was like okay
55:27
and i just kept on typing
55:30
you know what even the angels love it
55:32
that we're sharing heaven and all of our
55:34
products
55:35
represent something about heaven or
55:37
living righteously or being dangerous
55:39
against hell
55:41
all of the products we put up for that
55:43
reason and we we do have mp3s now we
55:45
have dvds cds
55:47
mp3s we have photographs we have
55:50
artwork now we have calendars we have
55:53
cups we have all kinds of stuff we're
55:54
creating
55:56
um to to demonstrate and manifest heaven
56:00
like here's one of the cups right here i
56:01
have one
56:02
it says i don't do
56:06
demons and there's a little lightning
56:09
bolt representing when they were all
56:10
kicked out of heaven you know
56:12
then once you follow loose for that's
56:13
what that lightning bolt represents some
56:15
hell doesn't like it that we market
56:17
stuff like this because
56:19
it points fingers at them anyway so we
56:22
do all kinds of things so angels are
56:24
going to be present
56:25
even if you don't see them they're
56:26
present if you're speaking on behalf of
56:28
god
56:29
when you're praying they're there your
56:31
angels always there maybe turn around
56:33
every now and then say thank you for
56:34
watching over me
56:36
that's perfectly okay you're not sitting
56:37
down having tea with them however if god
56:39
allows it enjoy it
56:42
we're living in a different life and
56:44
time now and i know that before the end
56:46
does come which is generations away
56:49
it will be normal for you to see angels
56:51
in your home
56:52
and angels in your car outside your car
56:55
because they're there all the time i see
56:56
them
56:57
and i know more and more the spiritual
57:00
realm
57:00
and these are spiritual beings in the
57:02
spirit realm the spirit realm will be
57:04
more
57:05
and more visible in our lives so you
57:08
live in a great time
57:10
okay you live in a great time and great
57:11
things are about to happen in this earth
57:14
even in the midst of everything else
57:16
god has his plans and so i would just
57:18
encourage you we'll probably take one
57:19
more question and that will be it for
57:21
today
57:22
and you never know when we're going to
57:23
show back up again
57:25
yes i i hope that you're enjoying this
57:29
time with us
57:30
and uh even though it was unplanned i
57:32
love spontaneous spontaneous still
57:35
happens in heaven
57:36
okay okay and so uh well we'll
57:39
let jen um okay share one more question
57:42
um okay this might take a while but i
57:45
know we've discussed this before
57:48
that's okay someone wants to know i
57:51
don't i don't didn't see who
57:53
asked the question but someone wants to
57:54
know is the
57:56
virus the mark of the beast or the the
57:59
vaccine
57:59
the vaccine it's the mark of the beast
58:02
uh we we've had this long
58:04
conversation about this everything is
58:08
many years something comes up that is
58:11
the mark of the beast yes and i have
58:12
lived along with you and let me tell you
58:14
they were doing it back in the 50s
58:17
oh i was alive oh even mom it
58:20
my our mom who was born in the 30s she
58:22
was born in the 30s
58:24
they said even back then they were
58:25
saying that the rapture was coming
58:27
the rapture was coming you know you know
58:30
what he says about all that just so you
58:32
know
58:33
revelation 21 the very end of the bible
58:37
okay the very end of the bible there's
58:39
so much still
58:40
that has to happen the best of things
58:43
other than christ being born
58:45
him dying on the cross tearing up hell
58:48
wasting hell
58:49
okay those were amazing powerful things
58:51
the holy spirit coming
58:52
those were great times but we're
58:54
entering into some of the most powerful
58:56
exciting times as a believer
59:00
that's your life that's the what you
59:02
what's coming for your life
59:04
okay but i can tell you the mark of the
59:06
beast
59:07
is nowhere right now there's nothing
59:09
that's been created on the earth that
59:10
is the mark of the beast at all in any
59:13
way whatsoever
59:14
it isn't the michael chip oh no they
59:16
used to say the bar code okay when i was
59:18
going to the barcode
59:19
you're going to walk around with a bar
59:20
called this big on your head right that
59:22
was going to be the mark of the beast
59:24
this is the crazy thing i will say this
59:26
the mark
59:27
a mark is a visible mark you will see it
59:31
a visible permanent mark you will see it
59:33
with your eyes
59:34
it's not something hidden in your skin
59:36
it's not something that will happen
59:38
or a frequency that will be around no
59:40
it's not the 5g
59:41
it's not 5g people this is what god said
59:44
about 5g
59:45
that just means the gospel will go
59:47
further and stronger than ever before
59:50
around the world around the world which
59:52
is his purpose so don't look for the 5g
59:54
to be the mark of the beast that can't
59:56
even happen
59:56
okay the antichrist is not on the earth
59:59
the
60:00
spirit or the attitude or the nature
60:04
antichrist means anything that's against
60:06
christ himself
60:08
anything that speaks truth and hope is
60:11
and then that is the that is the truth
60:13
but anything that speaks against it
60:16
is an antichrist spirit jesus said even
60:18
now the antichrist spirit is in the
60:20
earth he didn't mean the person
60:22
he met the way it will operate he will
60:24
speak against
60:25
god the antichrist will be against jesus
60:28
christ
60:28
his holiness his sovereignty it will
60:31
speak
60:32
totally against all of that that that
60:35
stuff is going on but the antichrist
60:37
himself has not been born how about that
60:39
one people
60:40
he's not on the earth because he
60:41
couldn't operate in his fullness
60:43
with the body of christ taking authority
60:46
over the earth ruling and reigning on
60:47
christ
60:48
uh changing things speaking to things
60:51
it wouldn't be able to be here he
60:53
couldn't be here in the time when the
60:56
antichrist comes the whole world will be
60:58
falling apart
61:00
millions of people will be missing off
61:02
of the earth it will be a
61:03
horrible experience for people and he
61:06
will be
61:07
their their protector he will be their
61:10
savior the antichrist will have answers
61:12
for all that stuff
61:13
he's not here that stuff is not
61:16
happening
61:16
so no the mark of the beast is not out
61:19
here somewhere
61:20
but it will be a permanent visible mark
61:22
and satan will make sure people
61:24
want to take it back in the days of that
61:26
happening
61:27
and you will see it walking down the
61:29
street he can't force you to take it
61:31
people because it would defeat his
61:32
purpose
61:33
his purpose he wants to flaunt that
61:36
people want him and they they want him
61:38
to be there
61:40
so this is not the time for any of that
61:42
it's not the time of the four horses of
61:44
the apocalypse it's not the time for the
61:46
wormwood whatever to hit the earth
61:48
it isn't time for death and destruction
61:51
it isn't it is the time for the the
61:54
knowledge
61:55
and understanding and the operation of
61:57
the glory the power of god
62:00
seen going around the earth
62:03
in these days there's baptism in fire
62:05
that will burn all the fear out of you
62:07
all the world out of you okay
62:09
that has not happened yet okay the
62:11
manifested sons and daughters speaking
62:13
to earthquakes to make them stop and put
62:15
it back the way it was before it
62:16
happened or anybody died
62:18
that's a manifested son or daughter
62:20
raising the dead that were cremated
62:21
that's a manifested son or daughter are
62:23
you seeing that
62:24
it's not even happening but we have to
62:27
have this in the earth
62:28
because she said it would be here and
62:31
the wealth of the will
62:32
the wealth of the wicked has to be
62:33
transferred to the just and the
62:34
righteous
62:35
those things haven't even started
62:38
stop asking if the mark of the beast is
62:41
out there
62:41
stop asking if this is the end and
62:44
everything's going to crash and just be
62:45
blown away
62:47
it isn't and i have news for you the
62:49
earth won't even stop
62:50
being here until after the tribulation
62:54
is
62:54
over and it's done and gone they'll
62:57
still be natural people on the earth
62:59
jesus christ will sit on the throne in
63:01
jerusalem
63:02
for one thousand years when all of that
63:06
is
63:06
done and gone many of us will be in
63:09
heaven
63:09
okay and then the earth then jesus will
63:12
be king of the world for one thousand
63:14
years will be no wars no weapons will
63:16
even be used
63:17
saint will be in the bottomless pit just
63:20
falling
63:21
he will not even be on the earth
63:22
there'll be no evil on the earth at the
63:23
time there'll be people who don't want
63:25
christ
63:25
on the earth so you can see that even at
63:28
the end of this
63:29
age we're in which is still got quite a
63:32
few generations to it
63:34
the next age after this age will be the
63:36
millennial age so the earth will still
63:37
be here
63:38
it'll still be operating it says people
63:40
will still be getting married and being
63:42
given a marriage so don't try to make
63:45
god's will be pushed into a little box
63:49
of what people have told you it will be
63:51
this is not the last day
63:54
this is not the perilous times where you
63:56
can't build you can't eat there won't be
63:58
anything to do
64:00
you'll barely be able to breathe you
64:02
won't see blue sky
64:03
you won't even be here during that time
64:06
you are
64:06
here during some of the greatest days on
64:08
the earth and i'm just going to
64:10
end with this because it is so powerful
64:12
to understand god's timing
64:14
he has things in his own word he wrote
64:18
if they're still in some of the newer
64:20
bibles i hope they leave them in there
64:23
the perilous times have not happened the
64:25
tribulation has not happened
64:27
it will not happen for quite a long time
64:31
your focus is to know christ
64:34
to have an intimate relationship to
64:37
speak hope
64:38
life create things invent things
64:42
give people hope for a future not
64:46
demon gloom okay god himself the father
64:49
is the only one who decides when jesus
64:51
comes back and he is too busy ruling and
64:53
reigning with us
64:54
okay so look for greatness look for
64:57
god's plan for your life
64:59
run after it don't sit him on the curb
65:01
somewhere make sure he stays with you
65:04
no holy spirit and know that you
65:08
are chosen to be here now
65:12
you are not chosen for wrath we
65:15
as the body of christ have not been
65:17
appointed unto wrath
65:19
so we won't be here there will be people
65:22
saved during the times of the
65:23
tribulation
65:24
those are other people who were not
65:26
christians before that happened okay
65:29
you focus on what he wants right now
65:31
which is he wants you to be great for
65:33
him in the earth
65:35
bring hope and life watch your words
65:37
watch your choices
65:38
but live happy
65:41
make sure you have fun because heaven
65:44
is half fun and half powerful
65:48
it's so filled with splendor glory and
65:50
awe
65:51
of god fun as a weapon against fun
65:54
is a weapon when you're having fun the
65:56
enemy doesn't like it
65:58
so make sure you're using confusion too
66:00
yes it confuses his head
66:03
because he can't understand why he's not
66:04
keeping you crushed down
66:06
all right run after god himself
66:10
and let god take care of all the rest of
66:13
that stuff
66:13
don't look for the mark of the beast
66:15

02:08
to be amazing
02:10
and i just want to add this about the
02:11
northwest did you not know
02:14
the places that are the most significant
02:16
to god are the ones that are attacked
02:18
the most by the enemy
02:20
and that's why satan wants to keep that
02:23
area dry because
02:24
it is like a wellspring i'm not just a
02:27
well but a wellspring
02:28
and i'm telling you god is going to
02:30
explode from that area and come
02:32
from that very corner of uh this country
02:35
and flood all over the place so
02:37
just stay excited everybody and don't
02:40
miss it don't miss this
02:41
event that's gonna happen wow that's
02:44
powerful because
02:46
uh you know you're talking about
02:47
wellsprings and really i want to talk
02:49
right now
02:50
about the wellsprings of revival i
02:51
believe we are in a season where god is
02:55
re-digging or digging up the old wells
02:57
like in the days of isaac
02:59
yeah and he's also digging up new wells
03:02
the old wells and the new wells and of
03:04
course right now
03:05
we're in the month of february it's it's
03:07
my favorite uh month of the year why
03:09
because it's my birthday month
03:11
so welcome to february everybody but of
03:14
course in this
03:15
month uh catherine coleman passed
03:19
uh billy graham pass john paul jackson
03:23
bob jones and paul kane so i really feel
03:25
like
03:26
kat and sherelle did this season god
03:29
wants us to dig
03:30
up the old wells and the new whales of
03:34
revival
03:34
in america because we're in a new season
03:37
now
03:38
i want to ask you miss cat what do you
03:40
think about that word
03:42
and what god's doing and digging up the
03:44
old wells
03:45
and the new wells right now well i do
03:47
know this
03:48
that he's definitely in a generational
03:50
thing right now
03:52
which means the generations of the past
03:54
and everything that they did
03:56
and made as a foundation is going to
03:58
explode
03:59
in this in the generations of this uh
04:02
time on the earth
04:03
and those who are alive on the earth
04:05
it's going to really it's going to
04:07
accelerate
04:08
everybody forward and upward and so yes
04:11
i definitely agree with that the things
04:12
that the people lay down their lives for
04:14
i love it that in the month of love
04:18
you know god took all those mighty men
04:21
and women home
04:22
and i actually knew bob jones would go
04:24
home the father told me the birth of
04:26
february and taking bob home on the 14th
04:28
and he said it's going to open up whole
04:30
new portals whole new gates
04:32
all over this nation and he said so
04:34
everybody needs to be excited
04:36
and you know but that was several years
04:37
ago but that doesn't matter god builds
04:39
on things he knew everything that would
04:42
happen and yet he's still gonna do
04:44
everything he wants but this is what
04:45
we'll have at the end
04:46
we will have great victory and great
04:49
celebration
04:51

04:54

07:42
wow amen and amen absolutely i i feel
07:45
like right now
07:46
because of where our conversation's
07:48
going i feel like we need to talk about
07:51
what is god doing in this month of
07:52
february what is god going to do
07:56
in our country and in the nations of the
07:58
earth that i just feel such an
08:00
expectation and an anticipation
08:03
because february is going to be a mega
08:05
month of miracles
08:07
so let's talk about that right now and i
08:09
want to
08:10
pass to mike in the florida prophetess
08:12
sherelle what do you what do you sense
08:14
what do you expect
08:15
god to do in this month of february in
08:18
this season right now
08:20
well it's it just blew my mind that as
08:23
soon as you guys got on here you started
08:25
talking about
08:26
the wells of revival i don't know if you
08:28
guys
08:29
know about a prophetess named fuchsia
08:32
pickett
08:33
but she was a prophetess back here in
08:35
the 70s i believe
08:37
and she i was reading some of her book
08:39
last night and she was talking about how
08:42
wellsprings of revival were going to
08:45
burst up in certain areas of this
08:48
uh of washington and this area over here
08:52
and so
08:53
i began to see a vision when i was
08:56
reading that
08:57
and i saw the lord show me that there's
08:59
been like
09:00
holes of revival in the grounds of the
09:03
earth here
09:03
and some people have sown seeds of faith
09:06
and they've prayed and they've prepared
09:09
the way
09:10
and revival has come up to the surface
09:13
a couple times but man put his foot
09:17
on the coals man tried to stop the move
09:21
of the holy spirit and what the lord is
09:24
saying to me
09:25
about these next few months is that we
09:28
are going to be led by the spirit the
09:31
spirit
09:32
is going to lead us man is no longer
09:34
going to lead the spirit
09:36
and it's i'm i'm excited i just feel
09:39
like the holy spirit what the lord
09:41
showed me in 2017
09:44
he told me that the holy spirit will be
09:46
given a platform
09:48
and that's what we're seeing in this
09:49
season a place
09:52
that is cultivating revival by letting
09:55
the holy spirit
09:56
lead amen and you know just uh just to
10:00
piggyback on that you know
10:02
really the next three months i want you
10:05
to hear these words
10:06
because the next three months there's
10:08
going to be
10:09
monumental momentum that's going to take
10:12
place
10:13
from now passover i wish somebody heard
10:16
me today
10:17
from today february 1 to passover which
10:21
is of course in the middle of april
10:23
for the next three months there's going
10:24
to be mega momentum
10:26
monumental momentum that's going to
10:29
shift you
10:31
into harvest and into miracles so
10:33
there's going to be a lot of setup
10:35
for financial miracles miracles in your
10:38
business and even salvation
10:39
in your family but from now to passover
10:42
begin to prepare
10:44
because there's going to be mega setups
10:47
for your divine breakthrough
10:48
now before i pass the mic over uh to the
10:51
woman of god
10:52
cancur i just want to read the scripture
10:54
because we're talking about whales
10:56
because i believe god is springing up
10:59
wells right now in the spirit
11:01
genesis 26 18 isaac
11:04
reopened someone said reopened which
11:06
means it was closed but he opened up
11:08
again
11:09
isaac reopened the wells
11:12
that had been dug up in the time of his
11:15
father
11:15
abraham which the philistines ding ding
11:18
ding key were
11:19
philistines which are enemy opposing
11:22
giants
11:23
the giants of the land the giants of
11:27
welfare of poverty of socialism the
11:29
giants of
11:30
human trafficking of the elitist the
11:34
philistines had stopped the whales
11:37
after abraham died and so
11:41
right now these giants of the land of
11:43
201 are trying to
11:45
stop the wells or stop the flow of your
11:48
finances stop the flow
11:50
of the holy spirit stop the flow of
11:53
revival but
11:54
god wants to anoint you to dig
11:57
up and open up again what has been
12:00
closed
12:01
by these philistines these opposing
12:03
giants
12:04
and god's going to be doing it from
12:06
today february 1st all the way to
12:08
passover so you watch
12:10
god's about to open up miss cat what are
12:12
your thoughts here what do you want to
12:13
say to the people right now
12:15
i i have to say exactly what the father
12:18
is continually saying to me
12:20
don't we don't lose that um that spirit
12:24
of celebration
12:25
and maybe you don't know this people but
12:28
celebrating in heaven is
12:29
mainly what they do it's one of the ways
12:31
they worship god it's one of the ways
12:33
they
12:34
are are thankful and grateful to him for
12:36
all the things that they
12:37
that he did for us while we were on
12:39
earth and also once they get to heaven
12:41
and so they are celebrating in heaven
12:43
already and i do
12:44
know another prophet uh hank kuhneman
12:47
who always talks about
12:48
january february and march that leads
12:50
into april
12:51
and he is almost in line with what
12:53
you're saying he says that january will
12:55
begin to bring justice
12:57
february will be all the fireworks of
12:59
the beginning of everything happening
13:01
and then marching into the end of the
13:03
march will be great celebration and
13:05
miraculous
13:06
so uh that's what he has heard from god
13:08
i can tell you that i continually hear
13:11
that justice is already beginning to be
13:13
served and all the stuff that's going on
13:15
and just let me add what the father just
13:18
shared with me
13:19
yesterday about all the stuff going on
13:21
we know
13:22
that those who are now sitting in seats
13:25
of authority
13:26
are illegitimate that's what the father
13:28
says is illegitimate
13:30
power in other words not power given in
13:32
the natural
13:33
not power given in the spirit you know
13:35
the whoever is the head of a government
13:38
it says that when the righteous are in
13:40
power the people rejoice but when it's
13:42
the wicked and the evil are
13:44
that great the sadness comes upon them
13:46
well i need to remind
13:48
everybody that right now those who are
13:51
in authority don't have power not
13:53
real power which will be shown and
13:55
proven when that great victory comes
13:58
and god will shift back what his
14:00
intentions always were
14:02
and the truth is this the one who is in
14:04
true authority even
14:05
right now yeah which is trump
14:08
he is actually a president he did win
14:11
the election
14:12
and he is the one in authority still
14:14
welcoming god still having plans by the
14:16
way he's still getting ready to work
14:17
plans i just have to let you all know
14:19
that
14:20
and it's beginning to be no secret that
14:21
that's happening so there's a lot of
14:23
people
14:23
right now in dc very afraid demons are
14:27
leaving dc like crazy i mean they're
14:29
just leaving racing out of there
14:31
and this is what god said that is
14:33
because it's
14:34
illegitimate power so those who are
14:37
righteous right now
14:39
they are still in power they're the ones
14:41
in power
14:42
and what he says what our president says
14:44
the true president says
14:46
is what will affect this cup this
14:47
country not just in the natural
14:50
but in the spirit realm this is what the
14:52
father says
14:53
the wicked and evil trying to rule they
14:55
have no power
14:57
no true power so they have no right no
15:00
portals
15:00
open to them to allow evil to flood this
15:03
country like people think is happening
15:05
i'm sorry but the devil isn't going to
15:07
be taking over
15:08
because there's no true portal or
15:10
opening you have
15:12
for that to happen that is shut you
15:15
should be rejoicing everybody because
15:16
this is going to be an accelerated thing
15:18
that begins to happen
15:19
with the revival going into the
15:21
habitation of god in this
15:23
in this country and all over the world
15:25
actually so
15:26
these are celebrator times these are
15:29
victorious times
15:30
these are not times to be crushed and to
15:32
be sad and to have fear in you
15:34
about the only thing the devil's getting
15:36
away with is bringing fear
15:38
all those regulations and all those laws
15:40
being made illegal
15:42
illegitimately will not stand
15:45
yes well this is why you should be
15:47
celebrating because we will have the
15:49
ability
15:50
to move unhindered all open country
15:54
as god moves and does the victory thing
15:57
and you will see it with your eyes
15:59
everybody will see it with your eyes
16:00
this is why it's so important to come to
16:02
these events right now
16:03
to get filled up to get excited to begin
16:06
to make plans with god himself
16:08
about what your part will be in this so
16:10
this is a strategic event
16:12
you don't want to miss this this event
16:14
because this is god's time to bring in
16:16
that double
16:17
decade the divine decades uh
16:20
back to back in this in this country
16:22
here and it's going to be so powerful
16:24
your life won't be the same
16:26
we don't want it to go back exactly the
16:28
way it was we want it to be greater more
16:30
powerful in god
16:31
that we will be more accelerated forward
16:34
and the law will
16:35
flow in this country especially between
16:37
the body of crisis was really needed
16:39
first
16:40
and i declared that that love will be
16:41
released because the other
16:43
can't be hell can't be released right
16:45
now people
16:46
if you get me in the spirit room if you
16:48
were a or you would understand
16:50
it's leaving hell is leaving
16:53
and so that leaves those who want to be
16:55
in power
16:56
power less they won't have the effects
16:58
they won't have the enticement they
17:00
won't have that
17:01
uh the captivation of hell and evil
17:04
although it's already in them
17:05
it will not be released or lose
17:07
throughout this land because there's
17:08
been no portals
17:09
open because the one in true authority
17:12
is not allowing it
17:14
come on that's so good and of course the
17:17
wells are actually
17:18
portals because wells
17:21
one more thing there are these massive
17:24
angels some of the hosts have already
17:26
been sent to some of these wells
17:28
and they have these swords probably
17:30
they're 15 feet high swords
17:32
and they're like standing there like
17:33
this over them about to hit
17:35
them when we declare something at this
17:37
event they will hit
17:39
these wells these drywalls and they will
17:41
literally be open
17:42
and they'll shoot on springs so this is
17:45
a
17:45
specific event planned by god so this
17:48
can happen so don't miss being a part of
17:51
uh having those wells open can i share
17:55
something with you really quick uh
17:57
that's what i was seeing in the spirit
17:58
when i was beginning to pray and see you
18:00
coming over to this area
18:02
i saw you just taking a stake and
18:04
driving it
18:05
into the ground and it just broke open
18:09
this area and i saw the wells begin to
18:12
bubble up and the the
18:14
springs just begin to spring forth
18:17
throughout the earth
18:18
in this area and it just goes all the
18:20
way
18:21
from this side all the way down into the
18:24
east coast
18:25
and i just believe it's going to start
18:27
something here in this area
18:29
that has not been done before i'm so we
18:32
are so excited
18:36
well absolutely the convergence that
18:39
happens
18:40
when the right anointings and mantles
18:42
come together
18:43
and and times uh you do not receive a
18:46
breakthrough
18:47
because there's an element that's
18:49
missing but i believe
18:51
again us coming together especially with
18:53
miss cat especially with the now
18:55
anointing and the now word that she
18:56
carries
18:57
sun is gonna break open in the pacific
18:59
northwest
19:00
so listen people of god you need to be
19:03
there at this event i mean we're pretty
19:04
much sold out i don't know if
19:06
we can do overflow open up the doors and
19:09
have people just sitting outside we may
19:11
have to do that honestly
19:12
because we're already sold out uh but
19:14
you know there's going to be something
19:16
powerful that's going to be released
19:18
that's going to affect all the regions
19:21
of states nearby i guarantee it i
19:22
believe witches
19:24
are going to come to jesus yeah people
19:27
who are in
19:27
new age are going to be delivered okay
19:31
to warlocks weekends people
19:34
moving in the dark and black magic and
19:37
dark spirits they're they're going to
19:39
feel the tremors of the wealth opening
19:42
up so it's going to be powerful
19:44
um you know again as we're talking about
19:47
all this again what god is doing
19:49
in america right now on the earth what
19:51
god is doing from now
19:53
february all the way to april passover
19:56
and now specifically for this conference
19:57
this event
19:59
the washington glory invasion you know
20:02
i'm just reminded of
20:04
again uh uh john g
20:07
lake how he started up the healing
20:10
whales and the healing rooms in spokane
20:13
washington
20:14
and you know there's something
20:15
supernatural
20:17
that happens in the pacific northwest
20:19
and i believe something's going to break
20:21
with that mantle
20:22
now prophet shirelle is there something
20:24
you want to share with us concerning
20:26
john g
20:27
lake the healing rooms and that well of
20:29
revival
20:30
that's about to burst open i just
20:34
know that we are getting close we have
20:36
been seeing
20:37
more miracles than ever before
20:41
in our second service we had a man come
20:44
in and walk out of a wheelchair
20:46
i mean when taylor ran up to me and she
20:48
was like mom there's someone outside in
20:50
a wheelchair and i was going
20:52
oh my gosh not a wheelchair on my second
20:54
service
20:58
but it was incredible it's just
21:01
awesome to be pioneering here what has
21:04
been in god's heart for so long
21:07
and i just what i'm seeing is that this
21:10
explosion that's gonna happen
21:12
no man can keep his foot on it then the
21:16
holy spirit is getting ready to explode
21:18
in this area i believe we're going to
21:20
see miracles like never before
21:23
i believe we're going to see limbs
21:25
growing out
21:26
more blind eyes and deaf ears being
21:28
healed but not only that
21:30
families being healed god is calling
21:33
whole
21:34
families in this season he's calling the
21:36
prodigals
21:37
home and i'm so excited to see
21:41
and be a part of this movement and it's
21:44
like
21:44
god is strategically placing people
21:47
the right people together people that
21:50
probably
21:51
really never wanted to do anything like
21:53
this i don't know about you cat but i
21:55
was just minding my own business when
21:57
the fire of god
21:58
fell on me in my living room and he told
22:00
me to go live on facebook and i was like
22:03
you want me to do what
22:08
so i just believe that god
22:11
is raising up a remnant in this season
22:14
in this hour he's the people that he's
22:16
bringing to the hub here
22:18
are just so hungry and they're tired of
22:22
church
22:22
they're tired of religion they're tired
22:25
of being
22:26
put in a box i took the box slacks
22:29
last week and i ripped it in half and i
22:31
threw it
22:32
and i stomped on it during the circuit
22:36
because i just believe you know when
22:38
we're led by the holy spirit
22:41
it's powerful yes it is we give him the
22:44
platform
22:45
and he does it all it takes the pressure
22:47
off of us
22:48
and we just give him the reigns and we
22:50
say have your way holy spirit
22:53
and i believe that's people like john g
22:55
lakes that's what he did
22:56
he probably surrendered his life to the
22:59
holy spirit and that's why god
23:00
used him so mightily and that's what
23:03
we're seeing right now
23:04
and another thing is i feel like
23:08
you know um god's using the most
23:11
unlikely people
23:12
yeah and people that are not really that
23:16
well liked people don't like cats pink
23:19
hair
23:20
people don't like my pink lipstick
23:26
but i'm just being obedient to god and
23:29
just saying
23:30
use me lord i surrender my life to you
23:32
and
23:34
he's gonna he's gonna do something in
23:36
this area that we have not seen
23:38
we are getting ready to see something
23:41
that we have never
23:43
seen i mean what are the odds of the
23:46
kansas city chiefs
23:48
going to the super bowl for a second
23:50
time
23:51
yeah that's incredible well well
23:55
once again god god is the god of the
23:57
miraculous and he's the god of the
23:59
double and the triple
24:00
so i believe in the season just like
24:02
prophet shirelle said
24:03
that the unlikely the no names the
24:06
faceless
24:06
those that objected looked down upon i
24:09
mean president donald j
24:10
trump took took it by storm and he came
24:14
totally from
24:14
left uh from the left side from you know
24:17
left wing
24:18
but again it's those types of people
24:20
where there will be a supernatural grace
24:22
to be an apostolic chief like the kansas
24:25
city chiefs
24:26
god's raising of apostolic chiefs
24:28
prophetic warriors in the season
24:30
who carry the now word of god and who
24:32
walk in signs
24:34
and wonders yeah uh of course we're
24:37
talking about this event
24:38
uh you know we're all going to be
24:40
together literally in a few days
24:42
i know my cities
24:52
uh talk to us what are you expecting for
24:55
this
24:56
event it's really not even an event but
24:58
it's
24:59
it's a family celebration it is because
25:03
it's actually an encounter um yes god
25:06
doesn't always call things events
25:07
anymore he calls them encounters
25:09
and those who are there or who choose to
25:11
encounter what he's got
25:13
those are the ones who will go away with
25:15
it to use it to release it for him
25:18
but something else about john g lake um
25:22
i remember one time when i was i was
25:24
under attack that was probably maybe 12
25:26
14 years ago when all that happened and
25:29
i was heading to
25:30
memphis to um release elvis's mantle to
25:34
be completed because it wasn't completed
25:37
and then he bought me every way i could
25:39
that's how important mantles are they're
25:40
so important
25:42
and i i told my husband knows throw me
25:44
in the back of the
25:45
truck there was a double cab and
25:47
margaret drove all the way there and we
25:49
were listening to
25:50
um billy brims tapes about had all those
25:54
who had passed on before
25:56
she had recorded things and i think john
25:58
g
25:59
lake's son-in-law was speaking and he
26:01
was talking about
26:03
um speaking in tongues and i'm telling
26:06
you it started to get really hot
26:10
it was so hot and all of a sudden the
26:13
holy spirit said
26:14
i want you to claim it and so he was
26:16
speaking under the anointing of the
26:19
lightning power of god that was one of
26:20
the things john d like operated in
26:22
it just blasts the enemy out it's still
26:24
a part of the fire of god
26:26
and god said claim your healing and i
26:28
yelled i couldn't speak up until that
26:30
point it said i
26:30
i claim it and all of a sudden a fire
26:34
came through the speaker
26:35
hit me at the end of my feet when i went
26:37
my body and drove the sickness out
26:40
and i was instantly and i was on fire it
26:43
started getting so
26:44
hot in the cab and i know the holy
26:46
spirit was just laughing he was so
26:47
celebrating
26:48
see because i out of an act of obedience
26:51
i was just dared to do it
26:53
and when we got to the event when we got
26:55
to the this place
26:57
in memphis where i was speaking about
26:59
albus and why god called him and
27:00
anointed him
27:01
and was talking about that mantle then
27:03
people ran forward to get prayer
27:05
the holy spirit said impart the fire of
27:08
the lightning power of god into them i'm
27:10
like
27:10
when did i get that and he said you said
27:12
you received it and i said
27:14
i thought i received him and he said oh
27:16
you have the mantle
27:18
of the lightning power of god that john
27:19
g lake operated in and since
27:22
that day i have used that lightning
27:24
power god it destroys the works of
27:26
darkness no matter what is
27:28
about and i did it so much so many times
27:31
john g lake actually showed up
27:34
at my event
27:37
there you could see by several people
27:40
who were present
27:41
and he was just watching me release the
27:43
lightening power of god i can tell you
27:44
what's going to be the lighting power of
27:45
god is going to be at that event people
27:47
and it destroys the warts of darkness in
27:50
your life
27:51
in cities and regions and i mean no
27:54
guess what it's probably going to show
27:55
up there
27:56
probably john g lake that's where he's
27:58
from
27:59
and so expect the lightning power of god
28:01
expect the miraculous to happen and i do
28:04
expect things to happen that never
28:06
happened before so it's going to be a
28:08
power
28:09
a power encounter of god of holy spirit
28:13
of jesus
28:14
of this whole area being least
28:17
at least released into its destiny
28:20
to bring the life and the power of god
28:22
into this country and then throughout
28:24
the world so
28:25
this is a major encounter time
28:28
on god's timeline so please don't
28:31
miss being there because we are all a
28:33
part of this when we come into agreement
28:36
great power is released
28:39
wow that is so powerful that's why uh
28:41
you know as
28:42
myself and prophet shiro we prayed about
28:45
a title for this encounter
28:48
you know uh the washington glory
28:50
invasion because
28:51
the lightning angels of course the
28:54
thunders and lightnings from his throne
28:56
are actually angelic hosts that are
28:58
being released from his throne
29:00
okay those angels are going to be
29:02
invading and they're they're already
29:04
invading right now those angels are
29:05
going to be invading
29:07
this time and i believe right now even
29:09
from that
29:10

29:13

29:20
mantles a new measure of healing don't
29:23
be afraid of kobe don't be afraid of

29:27
what the world says there's a new wave
29:30
of
29:30
miracle working power and healing as
29:33
being

32:33
people in the world
32:34

32:37
hungry drawing that anointing that is in
32:41
me i can feel actually
32:42
leaving me now even though this is a
32:44
like you know a recording
32:46
uh i just already know that god's gonna
32:48
do something powerful
32:49
and i love that god will start in some
32:51
of the most unexpected places because
32:54
that's just who he is
32:56
he'll use the things that have been
32:57
abandoned or overlooked or stopped or
33:00
delayed or halted

33:03

praise god amen any last word before we
33:33
just close our prayer today
33:35
as cat was just talking the lord
33:38
reminded me
33:39
of an encounter i had last month
33:42
i was down in my living room worshiping
33:44
on my knees and i had my eyes
33:46
closed and i could see the biggest
33:49
angel i've ever seen in the spirit
33:53
his wings were stretched from each side
33:56
of my living room and right at that
33:58
moment
33:59
it hit my spirit and i just knew that it
34:02
was the angel
34:03
of awakening and revival and
34:06
he said one thing to me he said
34:10
it is time
34:13
and as cat was speaking i just
34:16
kept hearing that over and over it is
34:19
time
34:20
it is the time and we are standing on
34:24
this
34:24
we are believing it and we are going to
34:28
see it come to fruition in this season

34:38
unity right now and where hands are

the wonder of you inside of us i thank

you for the father
04:00
and everyone said amen
04:04
amen wow this is an awesome atmosphere
04:11
thank you for coming everyone
04:16
the only thing i like more about going
04:18
to heaven is sharing it
04:22
i can't teach you how to do that i have
04:24
a commission to do that i can tell you
04:25
that he is catching people up
04:27
all over this world and showing them his
04:30
home
04:34
for christ said in my father's house are
04:36
many mansions
04:38
and i can assure you that his house is
04:41
not a building
04:44
it's not a platform somewhere in the sky
04:47
it is a world bigger than our galaxy
04:53
even bigger than that there's no way you
04:56
can measure it
04:57
or even understand how he designed it
05:01
it's always been his home until the day
05:04
he makes the new earth and then we all
05:05
have a home together
05:09
i don't know if you realize this is
05:10
actually willing to leave his own home
05:13
to live with us christ had to leave it
05:16
when he became down to earth and he
05:18
became flesh had flesh put him he died
05:20
on the cross
05:21
the holy spirit moved his base of
05:22
operations here because christ
05:25
sent him here and then one day the
05:28
father himself
05:29
will leave heaven and forever live on
05:31
the new earth with all of us
05:33
in that amazing that they had to be
05:36
willing to do all of that for us
05:39
that's because he loves you that's
05:42
because you actually came from him
05:44
everyone who ever existed came from him
05:48
you didn't live somewhere in heaven you
05:49
lived in him
05:51
he was your very world the enemy
05:55
is always trying to copycat what god has
05:58
he wants to be god that's never going to
06:00
happen
06:03
it didn't happen back in the ancient
06:05
times when he was thrown out of heaven
06:07
when he was so convinced he convinced
06:10
himself
06:11
he had won he got a third of the angels
06:14
on his side which still is almost it
06:16
makes you
06:17
undone to think about that doesn't it
06:20
they lived
06:21
with the god who made them and yet they
06:23
chose a creation
06:26
over the creator
06:31
and let me tell you just because god
06:33
didn't say anything to him didn't mean
06:34
that he didn't know about it
06:38
but the more he deceived and the more
06:41
god remained silent
06:42
he thought that he had won he thought he
06:45
was smarter than god
06:46
and then he found out in a second
06:50
he wasn't anything
06:54
he wasn't anything he was kicked out of
06:56
heaven all the angels were kicked out
06:58
with him
06:59
they can never be restored
07:02
and i know you may hear people preach
07:04
that one day god will forgive everybody
07:06
that everyone will go to heaven he'll
07:09
forgive lucifer he'll forgive the fallen
07:11
angels that will not ever happen
07:14
their future is already sealed in the
07:16
lake of fire
07:18
they will not be anywhere near us on the
07:20
new earth
07:23
it says the former things will be
07:24
remembered no more
07:27
in heaven right now though you give
07:28
testimony of your life
07:31
and the victory that god gave you on
07:32
this earth when you get to heaven
07:34
but one day none of the things that that
07:37
were a part of your life
07:38
are without him well you will not even
07:40
be able to remember them
07:43
but i will tell you right now even on
07:44
this earth we will become
07:46
so supernatural like him
07:50
let's say this together god said
07:54
let us make man in our image
07:59
and after our likeness and let them have
08:02
dominion
08:04
over the earth that's his plan for you
08:10
so people say that we can't be like him
08:12
they're wrong
08:14
he would have never said that and in
08:16
case you didn't know
08:18
after the likeness is the way they
08:20
operate
08:22
so he didn't just make you in his image
08:23
he gave you things inside of you
08:26
so that you could operate like him
08:29
so who is he he's a creator right
08:32
jesus christ is a commander is that
08:34
right
08:35
holy spirit goes every knows everything
08:37
all at the same time
08:39
holy spirit is an unlimited layered
08:41
being
08:44
don't you like revelation
08:48
he has unlimited layers of himself and
08:51
every layer of him
08:52
is a whole of him so wherever he sends a
08:56
layer of himself
08:57
he knows everything everywhere
09:01
all at the same time so for your
09:04
information
09:05
when you invite holy spirit to indwell
09:07
you
09:08
you don't get a little piece of him
09:11
he sends a layer of himself which is a
09:13
whole of him
09:15
who indwells you and that is what makes
09:17
you the temple of the holy spirit
09:22
that is one of the most important things
09:24
you can do after you get born again
09:25
it's not even preached in some places
09:27
right now you know because the enemy is
09:29
terrified of that happening to you
09:32
because then instead of walking beside
09:34
you
09:35
it says the word when you get born again
09:36
he comes alongside you is that right
09:40
and he'll be there all the time until
09:43
you're caught up to heaven one day
09:44
unless you do something about it
09:47
unless you choose to ask him to indwell
09:50
you you have to invite him
09:53
say we must invite say we had to invite
09:57
christ
09:59
to indwell us we have to invite holy
10:02
spirit
10:03
to indwell us it's heaven protocol
10:09
and the reason for that is you had to
10:10
make a choice
10:12
you chose with your will to receive
10:15
christ
10:16
and let me tell you we actually have a
10:18
new cd card born again that the father
10:20
had me just make
10:22
it tells you what happened in the spirit
10:24
realm what happened in eternity
10:27
in the scrolls of time and the lamb's
10:29
book of life
10:30
in hell and inside your very being
10:34
that made you the new creation what
10:36
happened at that time
10:37
at that moment in time and it's on this
10:40
cd called born again
10:42
it's one of the best witnessing tools
10:44
i've ever had or ever made
10:46
it explains why christ why do you have
10:49
to receive him
10:50
what happens when you receive him what
10:52
levels you can go after after that
10:54
happens
10:55
what happens when holy spirit indwells
10:57
you what happens all around you
10:59
what happens with the host of heaven
11:01
what happens with your guardian angel
11:03
this if you're not aware of the spirit
11:05
realm the unseen realm i'm talking about
11:08
the unseen realm
11:10
it says everything that was made that
11:12
you see was made by that which was
11:14
unseen
11:16
that means the unseen realm is the
11:18
original realm
11:20
not this physical realm this physical
11:24
realm is temporal
11:25
it's temporary that's what that means
11:28
but eternity is in this in the spirit
11:31
realm
11:32
there's more activity in the spirit
11:34
realm than there is in the scene realm
11:39
there's it never stops activity never
11:41
stops in the unseen realm not around you
11:44
not around where you live not in the
11:46
atmosphere
11:47
not into the third heavens there's
11:49
continual activity
11:51
both from heaven and from hell
11:55
and what you do in your life will draw
11:57
one or the other to you
12:00
that's why you need discernment that's
12:02
why you need holy spirit
12:03
that's why you need to pursue an
12:05
intimate relationship with jesus christ
12:08
there's a lot of stuff going on in this
12:10
world today even in the body of christ
12:13
that shouldn't be happening there's a
12:15
lot of good and there's a lot of god
12:17
i'm not going to discount that because
12:20
god is pouring himself
12:21
more and more into this world christ is
12:24
making himself
12:25
known to us every day of our life you
12:27
can increase
12:28
in that relationship with him because he
12:30
wants that kind of relationship with you
12:34
he's not sitting on the sideline
12:35
watching your life go by
12:38
no he armed us when you were born again
12:42
you got
12:42
weapons you got the anointing
12:46
you got authority given to you because
12:48
you
12:49
you are now a son of the living god your
12:51
son or daughter of the living god
12:54
and what you do with your life after you
12:56
receive him is totally up to you
13:00
but right now living on this earth are
13:03
many that he called to demonstrate for
13:05
him
13:07
in the greater works that christ talked
13:09
about
13:10
they're beyond your imagination
13:14
to even consider or think you might
13:16
actually get to do some of that
13:19
like going to a funeral and raising
13:21
someone the dead that was cremated
13:24
[Music]
13:27
i hope i got someone's attention
13:31
everybody say that's a greater work
13:36
people think well you know lazarus was
13:38
dead for four days correct
13:41
that's in the scriptures he was dead he
13:44
was stinking his body was stinking
13:47
mary and martha we're trying to show
13:49
christ it is too late let me tell you
13:51
christ did not cry because lazarus died
13:56
he said it was going to be okay didn't
13:58
he yeah
14:00
because he knew who he was you know he
14:02
cried because they didn't believe it
14:06
they were doubting him he had said yeah
14:09
he'll be resurrected yes we know on the
14:12
day that the dead in christ is raised
14:13
he'll be raising who's trying to say no
14:15
right now
14:17
you know he was there right he knew what
14:20
was going to happen let me tell you
14:22
people in abraham's bosom were shocked
14:27
do we ever think of that how many people
14:30
don't know what abraham's bosom was let
14:32
me see your hand
14:33
it's okay if you don't know a lot of
14:35
places don't teach that anymore
14:37
before christ died on the cross and
14:40
descended into hell and wiped up hell
14:42
went up to heaven and poured out his
14:44
blood on the mercy seat when people when
14:46
righteous people died that god called
14:48
righteous they descended
14:50
into abraham's bosom which was a
14:51
spiritual abode
14:53
god made for his friends they didn't sit
14:57
on rocks
14:58
it was a spirit round place it had
15:00
golden buildings it had a sky
15:02
it had a magnificent river it had king's
15:05
tables filled with feasts
15:08
for them to partake of and below that
15:11
was hell
15:13
and there was a great gulf between them
15:15
this is what the word says
15:16
and those in hell right inside the gates
15:18
of hell you come up to the courtyard of
15:20
hell
15:21
you could see up into abraham's bosom
15:24
but you couldn't go there
15:26
they could see them if they came close
15:27
to there was like um
15:29
i'm trying to think of the word my
15:31
mind's not in the natural realm at all
15:32
right now
15:34
i like a balcony reigning thank you holy
15:36
spirit
15:38
in this beautiful place he'd made for
15:40
abraham
15:41
isaac jacob joseph who raised jesus
15:44
right john the baptist was there is that
15:47
true
15:48
yes because they were righteous they
15:49
were kind of righteous either because
15:51
they believed in god himself
15:53
and they extended their faith for that
15:55
when they died they went there they
15:57
didn't they didn't descend into hell
15:58
that was for the wicked dad
16:01
but they could see each other at one
16:03
point
16:05
and so people in abraham's bosom already
16:08
knew the messiah
16:10
was on the earth as soon as joseph went
16:13
there
16:14
they knew because he wouldn't stop
16:17
talking about it
16:18
if you knew that and you went there
16:20
would you talk about it
16:25
yeah he nonstop talked about it and then
16:29
when john the baptist went who was his
16:31
cousin
16:33
he confirmed everything joseph said but
16:35
he even knew more
16:37
because he was there after joseph he was
16:39
still there living on the earth after
16:41
joseph went
16:42
and descended abraham's wisdom so then
16:44
john the baptist was talking about him
16:46
he actually saw him right he baptized
16:49
him
16:50
he wouldn't stop talking i have baptized
16:52
the messiah
16:54
he is here on the earth he's here
16:57
so they already knew in abraham's wisdom
16:59
the messiah was on the earth so let me
17:00
tell you when he showed up there
17:02
they knew who he was and he proved who
17:06
he was
17:07
because he himself left for the first
17:10
time left abraham's bosom
17:12
and crossed over into hell on his own
17:15
because he had an assignment
17:18
it was to take back our authority
17:22
and our dominion that god had given
17:25
you know had given adam and eve and then
17:26
they they sold out but you know what
17:28
they were redeemed yes they're in heaven
17:30
say yay
17:33
adam and eve are in heaven how about
17:35
that
17:37
they made it
17:41
so sometimes you don't really think
17:43
about the whole scope of this picture
17:47
and so as someone else came to abraham's
17:50
bosom
17:50
they would tell them what was going on
17:52
on the earth because they were new the
17:54
new arrivals
17:55
and it's just like in heaven when
17:57
somebody newly arrives they'll chase you
17:58
down
18:00
they'll start getting you the minute you
18:02
come in the gate and you're standing
18:03
trying to jump in the river
18:04
they're like okay what about this
18:07
whatever this is i heard this was going
18:08
on what about this
18:09
is this true now i saw something from
18:11
the portal but i didn't know all about
18:13
so why don't you why don't we go share
18:14
somewhere
18:15
they want to haul you off somewhere and
18:16
share with you they want to hear what i
18:18
want to hear what you have to say and
18:19
later you're going to have meetings
18:22
every one of your family members had to
18:24
stand on a platform and
18:26
share to the body of christ living in
18:28
heaven about their life
18:30
how god redeemed them what was going on
18:32
around them and then what was newly
18:34
invented on the earth they won every
18:35
time somebody new comes they want to
18:37
know
18:38
i promise you it was exact same in
18:40
abraham's bosom
18:42
okay you don't get a chance to do that
18:43
when you go to hell okay
18:45
you have no life in hell been there and
18:49
seen it
18:50
you don't want to go there there's
18:53
people right now saying there is no help
18:56
they may find out one day
19:00
there are there definitely is it talks
19:02
about it in the word it exists it's
19:04
there
19:06
but in abraham's bosom life was amazing
19:08
it was beautiful
19:11
they had feasts to eat you don't get
19:13
anything in hell
19:14
there will be no food in hell
19:18
i love that one song that says they
19:20
don't see they don't serve breakfast in
19:22
hell
19:26
if you haven't heard it i think
19:30
isn't it uh it's called like my father's
19:32
house isn't that the name of the song
19:35
but yeah big big house is big big house
19:38
and they are telling people you won't
19:39
get breakfast in hell
19:42
you don't
19:45
but abraham's bosom had more than enough
19:48
and plenty they needed
19:50
to enjoy their life they were always
19:51
excited when somebody knew came there
19:54
and most of the time they didn't have to
19:55
ask them they came there talking about
19:57
it
19:58
especially once the son of god and the
20:00
messiah was on the earth
20:01
that was the number one subject they
20:02
wanted to know about
20:04
i know i was taken there i saw abraham's
20:06
bosom
20:07
it wasn't some little tiny hovel on a
20:09
rock people picture them sitting in the
20:11
middle of the earth you know trying to
20:12
escape the lava
20:14
the spirit realm supersedes this
20:17
physical realm
20:18
that's why spiritual beings can pass
20:21
through the walls they can walk through
20:22
you your angel stands in you most of the
20:24
time
20:27
yeah they sit on you too sometimes
20:30
especially if you ever get out on the
20:33
floor
20:34
if you're knocked out by the spirit of
20:36
god or the glory whatever it is that
20:37
gets you on that floor and you can't
20:39
move
20:39
your angel is sitting on you
20:44
you can't even crawl i've been there i'd
20:47
see them sit on me
20:48
and they wouldn't get up and all i could
20:51
do was laugh i mean i couldn't crawl
20:53
like tell my family don't bother me
20:54
until i can crawl up to the you know
20:56
alter
20:57
leave me there
21:00
you'll find out one day everything they
21:02
did okay for you and to you
21:08
but there was big news in abraham's
21:10
bosom
21:11
about the messiah once
21:14
lazarus came he was
21:17
dead for four days where do you think he
21:19
was
21:21
he was the newest thing in abraham's
21:23
bosom
21:24
and that man who was one of christ's
21:26
best friends
21:27
knew beyonce who he was he would not
21:30
stop talking about the messiah
21:32
and here he is like into his starting
21:34
his fourth day there
21:35
just going full steam ahead wham
21:40
[Applause]
21:42
they lost their messenger
21:46
they heard a voice
21:47
[Music]
21:50
lazarus heard him he heard him calling
21:53
him from there
21:54
did you think he was going to say no i'm
21:55
busy
21:57
later when i'm done oh he did not care
22:00
okay
22:02
he called him to come forth he came out
22:04
of abraham his spiritual body came at
22:05
abraham's bosom
22:07
back into the tomb picked up his body
22:10
and he came out of that tomb still in
22:12
the wrappings
22:14
and he wasn't stinking
22:16
[Laughter]
22:18
because he was fresh alive
22:21
by the glory of god raised up from the
22:23
dead to be
22:25
a miraculous demonstration of the power
22:28
of
22:29
jesus christ which has been given to you
22:33
and i
22:35
you should see it that way we are joint
22:38
heirs with him
22:40
what he did on this earth we have the
22:42
ability if we walk in
22:43
and go after it to do that he said
22:47
that we have the ability to raise the
22:49
dead right heal the sick raise the dead
22:51
cast
22:51
out demons is that right
22:56
trump is supposed to you're right you're
22:57
supposed to follow us
22:59
if you believe you got to remember that
23:02
there are requirements
23:05
to all those who believe right these
23:08
shot
23:08
these signs shall follow them
23:14
and so here was christ demonstrating it
23:16
doesn't matter how long it doesn't
23:17
matter if your dad
23:18
you don't have you know no matter if you
23:19
died right then raise him up no he was
23:21
dead for
23:22
four days so if we're gonna do greater
23:24
works that means it has to be something
23:26
greater than being dead for four days
23:29
but he didn't mean being dead for seven
23:31
days he meant
23:32
when you were ashes
23:36
i i was taken forward in time and i
23:39
literally was shown this is one of the
23:40
greater works
23:42
and christ took me there and i saw
23:44
somebody raising someone from the dead
23:46
at a funeral that had been cremated
23:52
and everyone in the funeral home ran
23:54
down front through their face on the
23:56
floor
23:56
and began to cry out to jesus christ
23:59
[Music]
24:01
and i i am absolutely
24:06
what he shows me is literal he doesn't
24:09
show me symbolic things ever
24:11
he treats me like i may he says i'm
24:13
going to show you so you know what i'm
24:14
talking about that is something that
24:17
will happen
24:18
i'm sure it will go viral around the
24:20
earth
24:23
so the knowledge of the glory sometimes
24:26
will go through the internet
24:28
[Music]
24:30
did you think about that
24:34
that's something worth watching over a
24:36
few times isn't it
24:40
people watch laughing dogs 10 million
24:44
times
24:47
and i want to point out no matter what
24:49
tragedies and stuff are going on out
24:51
there
24:52
the laughing dogs top all the doom and
24:56
gloom and the wicked evil stop
24:59
because people want something that
25:00
they're going to enjoy
25:02
so why don't you give them something to
25:04
enjoy
25:07
your testimony should be filled with
25:08
glory power
25:10
right victory that's the word of your
25:13
testimony you overcome with that that's
25:15
not the story of your doom and gloom and
25:17
and 10 hours of your sufferings
25:20
that's a story a testimony
25:25
is how you were tested and you got
25:27
victory
25:28
and christ gets all the glory for it
25:32
he actually told me to tell you if
25:34
you're writing a book about your life
25:35
make sure he gets more than 10 pages
25:39
because it won't be worth reading if you
25:42
make people
25:43
suffer along with you through your
25:46
entire life
25:47
and at the end you give an ounce of
25:49
victory that doesn't show them that they
25:51
can overcome
25:53
even during the in the midst of what
25:55
they're going through
25:56
you should have victory every day of
25:58
your life because he delivers us
26:00
out of it all right
26:04
so start giving him the victory the
26:05
minute you step into something
26:07
start declaring you have victory you're
26:09
giving him the glory it's because of him
26:11
not you
26:12
that you are an overcomer because your
26:15
words have power
26:18
if you don't remember anything else
26:20
remember to watch your words
26:23
what do you want in your life what do
26:26
you want in your family's life
26:27
what do you want right now in your life
26:30
because what you say
26:31
is what you're going to get the word
26:35
says you'll eat the fruit of your lips
26:37
is that right whatsoever you will have
26:40
whatsoever you
26:42
say it loud you should have whatsoever
26:44
you
26:46
i think that means your words are
26:47
important
26:49
he made me count my words one time
26:53
every time i opened my mouth i had to
26:55
think about what i was going to say he
26:56
trained me to speak life
26:58
and not negative not negative
27:02
unless he shows me something that he has
27:05
said i am to be aware of
27:07
and to not be a part of i don't run
27:09
around
27:10
spending my life critiquing everybody
27:12
else's life and pointing out all their
27:14
weaknesses
27:16
because you're not helping them when you
27:17
do that
27:19
you're not you need to talk about
27:21
people's strengths
27:23
their gifts right god's plans for them
27:26
share the truth with them while you're
27:28
doing it because they're going to open
27:30
they're going to be open for you to
27:31
speak to them if you're encouraging them
27:34
not blasting them and i also know that
27:37
you help the enemy when you blast them
27:40
it's like you're part of the enemy's
27:41
camp
27:43
this is my assignment to tell them how
27:45
wicked and evil they are
27:46
how far they have fallen from god that
27:48
they're walking in hopelessness they'll
27:50
never have anything
27:51
no that is the enemy's words
27:54
that's how he talks if you hear that
27:56
don't say it
27:57
if you hear those words turn around go i
27:59
know who you are and i'll have nothing
28:01
to do with you
28:03
you'll freak him out because most people
28:06
just say what he says
28:08
right so if we're going to be like
28:12
christ in the earth we have to be
28:13
careful what we say
28:15
how we live the choices that we make
28:19
in our life your soul is fed every
28:21
minute of the day
28:23
by what you say what people say to you
28:25
what you watch what you hear
28:27
and places you go your soul is going to
28:29
be
28:30
whatever this is the way god said
28:32
whatever you enter into
28:33
is going to enter into you that's a
28:36
quote
28:38
a quote from heaven what you enter into
28:41
will enter into you that means in your
28:44
soul
28:46
and that's important because you are a
28:48
living soul
28:50
we've all said you know we have we you
28:52
know we we we we're a body
28:55
we are a spirit we have a soul no you
28:57
are a soul
28:59
you are a soul wrapped in your spirit
29:01
man
29:02
and you have flesh on your body so you
29:03
can have dominion in the earth
29:06
but you are a soul and you choose
29:09
whether it prospers or not
29:12
if you want to prosper and be in health
29:14
then you guard what goes in your soul
29:18
you can change the way you think the way
29:20
you respond even what happens to you
29:22
tomorrow
29:24
by what you decide tonight to do with
29:26
your soul you can't take your soul and
29:28
set it on a shelf and pretend like it's
29:30
something bad
29:31
because when i grew up in in
29:33
denominational churches they always said
29:35
the soulless realm is bad your soul is
29:37
bad
29:39
well then how come it got saved
29:41
[Laughter]
29:43
i was eight and i would have all these
29:45
big questions for people
29:47
that they didn't want to answer if my
29:50
soul
29:51
just got saved right he came to save
29:55
souls right if i gave it to jesus and he
29:58
moved in
29:59
then why is my soul bad
30:02
i don't think anything bad i'm not
30:04
looking at bad stuff i mean just only
30:06
eight years old
30:07
but they made decisions when i was young
30:09
i was going to be in the side of my
30:10
parents
30:11
i was going to be on god's side you know
30:14
i was going to help him
30:15
he needed help
30:18
so i really consider what i do with my
30:20
life even when i was young
30:22
i did so i escaped even though i was
30:25
raised as a teenager and the whole drug
30:27
thing when it first came out by by the
30:28
way marijuana is bad
30:39
no matter what they tell you that's from
30:42
heaven
30:44
he did not make it so you could smoke it
30:48
i don't care if it is a natural plant
30:53
i will preach it i grew up in that time
30:55
when it first came
30:56
well in my era when it first came
31:00
people lost jobs they lost friendships
31:04
they got sucked into lsd and all the
31:06
other drugs
31:08
i didn't do any of it i decided at 15 i
31:11
was having nothing to do with it and i
31:13
wasn't participating
31:14
so i still have all my brain
31:19
i'm in great help because i never
31:21
participated in the drug thing
31:24
i didn't need anybody else's approval
31:27
i wasn't part of a clique i didn't know
31:29
that peer pressure bothered me actually
31:31
i tried to talk
31:32
all my friends in high school well my
31:34
acquaintances i didn't have a lot of
31:35
friends i had i had a tribe at home
31:38
i would tell them i'll look right um i
31:39
said you're nuts for taking this stuff
31:41
you're gonna burn your brain cells up
31:43
you know what are you gonna become you
31:45
can't even think right
31:48
and people got i think i think 60 out of
31:50
600 seniors uh od'd in my senior class
31:54
off from drugs and all of them started
31:58
on
31:58
marijuana every single one of them
32:02
they actually give it to you free
32:06
they give it to you free get you hooked
32:08
up then they bring something stronger to
32:09
you
32:10
that's how it works i was in the
32:13
elevator in the hotel and i heard a
32:14
young man
32:16
he had come here on business to meet
32:18
with some business people here
32:20
and he was saying on the phone not
32:22
knowing who i was
32:24
we blasted him with the anointing the
32:25
whole time was there when he left
32:27
he said oh yeah i had a great time my
32:28
business meeting were very productive
32:30
and he said
32:31
these people were they were real real
32:32
with me we drank and we smoked some
32:36
i knew what he meant okay he didn't need
32:39
it for medicinal purposes
32:42
but these were leaders in a business
32:44
community
32:45
that gave it to this young man
32:48
that's not even ethical it's not
32:51
right he hadn't even had it before but
32:56
that's the enemy's plan
32:59
and he was saying man this was an
33:00
amazing experience in my mind i'm
33:02
thinking devil you are
33:03
not getting that person man i was
33:05
standing right now releasing the
33:07
anointing him he walked out the door we
33:08
sent the host of heaven upon all the
33:09
strongholds of the demonic
33:11
the addictive demonic to pull that
33:13
stronghold off of him and
33:14
pull it off of him and we were sending
33:16
on the glory after him the anointing
33:18
after him to break the yoke of darkness
33:19
off of him
33:20
and went god i am not tolerating this
33:23
i'm not tolerating it
33:28
and people well jesus didn't he said he
33:29
talked about any kind of pharmacia
33:33
that was drugs even back in his day they
33:35
had them
33:37
he talked about necromancers have
33:39
nothing to do with the necromancer
33:41
that is witchcraft
33:45
there's no good witches
33:48
and there's people that really think
33:49
there are there are no
33:52
good witches warlocks
33:56
wizards magicians
34:01
there was not one magician in the bible
34:02
that was good
34:05
and we're sitting here we've been so
34:07
consumed with society
34:09
and the world itself that we've accepted
34:11
a lot of stuff
34:12
but let me tell you he never accepted it
34:17
so we need to take a good long look at
34:18
ourself and say where am i
34:21
where am i and what god has called me to
34:23
be what he
34:24
what he showed me i am what christ gave
34:26
me how did he walk what did he do
34:29
we had braces forever what would jesus
34:31
do
34:33
not a lot of what goes on now
34:37
because if we're witnesses our life's
34:40
supposed to be a witness
34:41
right you didn't know you were going to
34:43
come to church tonight
34:46
because i'm saving the good stuff for
34:47
next
34:49
all those in abraham's bosom they lived
34:52
a righteous life according to
34:54
receiving god okay they believed who he
34:58
was they believed when he spoke they
34:59
believed they followed him and what he
35:01
said
35:02
and so they were kind of righteous so
35:03
they were they descended in abraham's
35:05
bosom
35:06
but the minute lazarus showed up they
35:08
knew something
35:09
was going to happen on the earth
35:12
not just to them they knew somebody
35:14
changed for them because their messiah
35:17
had come
35:18
they knew it they knew something would
35:20
be manifested in the earth and it
35:22
certainly was
35:23
maybe not what they expected but let me
35:26
tell you when christ himself
35:28
showed up a little while later with the
35:31
thief from the cross
35:33
because when christ gave up his spirit
35:37
he'd still be hanging there by the way
35:40
he didn't no one killed him he laid down
35:41
his life he actually had to make his
35:43
spirit man
35:44
leave his body he himself loosed it from
35:47
his body
35:49
yeah that's going to be in a movie one
35:51
day and then you will see in the movie
35:54
christ descending into abraham's bosom
35:56
him sharing the good news with them all
35:58
receiving him as christ as their savior
36:02
and let me tell you when the spear men
36:05
entered into that ground there was such
36:06
an upheaval
36:07
that they themselves walked on the earth
36:10
that were in abraham's bosom
36:12
go read the scripture
36:17
they were seen walking on the earth is
36:19
that crazy
36:20
you'd think they'd get a hint right okay
36:23
uh
36:24
that one's from a hundred years ago 300
36:26
years ago
36:27
he's walking on here something's going
36:29
on down there
36:30
[Music]
36:33
and christ wasn't numb because then he
36:34
was going to go wreck hal
36:39
my favorite one of my favorite times was
36:40
when they took me
36:42
when they took me down into hell and i
36:45
was there on the third day
36:46
when christ wasted them
36:48
[Music]
36:52
it will be in a movie
36:55
[Laughter]
36:57
[Applause]
37:02
not even a world-class movie a
37:04
heaven-class movie
37:06
that will be produced on this earth by
37:09
the best of the best with the best
37:11
special effects
37:12
that will get people undone everywhere
37:16
and they'll know what happened there's
37:18
actually a demand in hollywood they want
37:20
to know what happened between the cross
37:23
and when he when he went back to heaven
37:26
they want to know they want to know what
37:30
happened
37:30
[Music]
37:32
now when he went back when when his
37:33
disciples saw him ascending into heaven
37:35
he'd already been
37:36
there did you know that
37:40
because when he came out of the grave
37:41
what did he tell mary
37:43
i must go to my
37:45
[Music]
37:46
my father and your father right yeah
37:49
because he had to pour out his blood on
37:51
the mercy seat in heaven
37:54
so when he said it was finished on the
37:55
cross that meant that every
37:57
a sacrifice for all sin for all time
38:01
was once and for all never again would
38:03
something have to be sacrificed for sin
38:05
you would never again go to the temple
38:07
once a year to get forgiven did you know
38:09
that
38:10
they went once a year to get forgiven
38:12
okay then they tried to do their best
38:14
all year they go back again
38:16
and then heavenly sacrifices they had
38:18
this whole thing that god had shown them
38:20
to do
38:21
and then uh there's all kinds of things
38:23
you need to go back and read it
38:24
anyway that's the way you got forgiven
38:26
that's what that's what freaked out all
38:28
the high priest
38:29
when john the baptist started saying you
38:31
know repent of your sins the kingdom of
38:32
heaven is at hand
38:34
well they never heard that before that's
38:37
why they didn't like him
38:39
so when new revelation comes to the
38:41
earth there's always
38:43
upheaval and you're hearing the new
38:47
what is the new that means new things
38:49
will happen new ways will happen
38:51
new words will happen you're living in a
38:53
time like that right now
38:56
yeah because we'll be ruling and
38:57
reigning with christ
38:59
this is a whole new time that was a new
39:02
time a fullness of time has come that
39:04
was the fullness of time
39:07
so christ was wreaking heaven on the
39:09
earth before he ever went into hell then
39:10
he really wiped up
39:13
because hell thought they thought they
39:14
had won
39:18
the second time satan had a brain freeze
39:26
honestly he did the father said he lost
39:29
something in his mind when he fell
39:34
yeah part of his memory banks
39:37
because he still thinks even now he's
39:39
going to win
39:41
he's already been defeated well he was
39:42
he's totally defeated but i mean god
39:44
kicked him out of heaven he didn't win
39:46
them when he was going to take over
39:47
and go inside the father and rule from
39:49
inside the father
39:51
and be over all the people the people
39:53
weren't on the earth yet that was us
39:54
inside god
39:57
he knew we were in there
40:00
isn't that interesting he knew about us
40:04
for a very long time
40:06
he didn't know who we were he knew we
40:08
were important
40:09
he knew we weren't angels because god
40:12
didn't just speak and make us
40:14
we lived in him forever until he made
40:16
this earth time space
40:18
plan to send us here and when he made
40:20
adam's body
40:22
when the word made adam's body and the
40:24
father leaned over and breathed adam's
40:26
spiritual being
40:27
his spirit of life into his nostrils and
40:29
he became a living soul
40:31
uh the enemy was right there watching
40:34
because he was thrown on the earth
40:35
remember yeah he was watching he knew
40:37
where that came from
40:38
he knew that was somebody that came from
40:41
inside god and then he was
40:42
not well one way he wasn't happy because
40:44
now god was sending them
40:46
which would mean a lot of trouble for
40:48
him if they ever found out who they were
40:52
so god had a plan when he sent us people
40:56
it was to be like him on the earth to
40:59
take authority over all the power of the
41:01
enemy crush him push him back
41:04
take our rightful place that christ won
41:07
for us
41:08
he died for your sins but he went into
41:10
hell to get back your authority
41:12
that adam had given away because he was
41:15
righteous and they had no right to hold
41:16
him
41:18
so abraham's bosom was ready to see a
41:20
show
41:22
and hell was ready to put on a show but
41:25
there's only one person who put a show
41:26
on and made a show of it openly
41:30
and that was the son of the living god
41:34
[Applause]
41:38
if you if you don't think they like a
41:39
show up there you don't know them
41:42
because god put on a show
41:46
wasn't that a show when he sent
41:47
lightning bolts from himself and took
41:49
satan out right
41:51
and then one-third of the angels were
41:52
all kicked out the same way
41:55
they were celebrating in heaven because
41:57
they had had it up to here
41:59
with lucifer i don't know anyone in
42:02
heaven that cried when he was kicked out
42:05
the gabriel did not cry and michael
42:08
certainly
42:09
did not cry because from that moment on
42:11
he knew who the enemy was
42:13
because before that happened there was
42:15
no enemy
42:17
heaven was a delightful place it was a
42:20
wonderful place it was perfect in every
42:22
way
42:23
even lucifer was perfect in all his ways
42:25
until iniquity was found in him
42:28
and that was that he was greater than
42:29
god and he was going to take over
42:33
that didn't happen either so he was
42:36
kicked down to earth and decided well
42:38
i'm just going to take over here
42:40
on this nice place i'll just take over
42:42
here let me tell you what happened when
42:44
he first made those plans that didn't
42:45
work either
42:46
because then god brought the ice age and
42:48
he was sitting on a block of ice
42:52
you got to picture this this
42:58
is reality movie from heaven
43:02
when he was first cast out of heaven the
43:05
dinosaurs were on the earth
43:07
there was there was no sin on the earth
43:09
there was no darkness on this there's no
43:10
evil on the earth okay he brought that
43:12
with him
43:13
he began to make it a wilderness the
43:15
dinosaurs began to kill each other
43:16
because in the beginning they didn't i
43:18
saw him
43:18
i saw the earth when he made it the
43:20
first time
43:22
the dinosaurs walked with the watcher
43:25
angels
43:26
they left footprints the angels
43:29
in the ground and scientists are still
43:32
trying to figure out how they can make
43:33
it into cavemen
43:35
because they have blocks of like stone
43:38
with a put
43:39
a human footprint they think and
43:41
dinosaur prince
43:43
god put water angels on the earth to
43:45
care for them
43:47
watch your angels yeah they had flesh on
43:50
them
43:53
this is a reality movie this is reality
43:55
movie night
44:00
and they were here to care for the
44:01
dinosaurs
44:04
and god said well i'm not tolerating
44:05
this anymore you know he's going to take
44:07
over the earth
44:08
so god broke the water vapor shield that
44:09
covered the earth to put mist on the
44:11
ground so the dinosaur skin wouldn't
44:12
fall off
44:14
there had been no storms on the earth at
44:16
one point until of course
44:18
they heard cracks of lightning and then
44:19
here comes all the other stuff on the
44:21
earth
44:22
he began to make it a wilderness god
44:23
wasn't going to tolerate it
44:25
so the water vapor shield he put around
44:27
the earth which every one of your family
44:29
members has already seen this in heaven
44:31
you go into this place called creation
44:33
lab and god recorded all of it you get
44:35
to actually see how he made the heavens
44:36
and the earth
44:38
they know how all of it happened isn't
44:41
that amazing
44:44
so everybody gets to find that out they
44:46
know a whole lot up there
44:50
and so yeah so god broke the water of
44:51
april shield it flooded the earth until
44:53
he covered the whole earth
44:54
and then he blew on it and froze it and
44:56
there is satan with all of his plans
44:58
washed down the tubes again
44:59
because now he's got a block of ice and
45:01
he can do nothing on it
45:03
and there's the ice age
45:07
somebody didn't enjoy it
45:11
god removed his glory off the earth and
45:12
it said darkness covered the earth
45:15
and then we have verse two
45:19
[Music]
45:21
that was all in verse one then comes
45:25
verse two
45:26
and darkness was on the face of the deep
45:29
right
45:29
the spirit of god was hovering over the
45:31
waters is that correct over the waters
45:33
he didn't say there was ground
45:34
over the waters because in the beginning
45:37
he made it and it was good
45:40
he created in the beginning of time and
45:43
space
45:45
he made this plane to earth and it was
45:47
finished it was finished and it was good
45:50
create ted he created that was past
45:53
tense right
45:54
and then we come to verse two so
45:55
something happened between those two
45:56
verses
45:58
a whole lot because then he starts to
46:02
take it apart
46:03
and put it back together is that what he
46:05
says
46:06
yes there was water on everything water
46:08
on the sky
46:09
water on the land he took the water off
46:12
the firmament
46:14
that was the air that was the sky that
46:16
was in the ground of the ground
46:17
i'm doing my motions again people my
46:20
staff say don't do that
46:23
my hands move okay i can't
46:27
we help it he began to take it apart it
46:30
clearly explains to you what he did
46:32
right
46:33
so he was going to recreate the earth or
46:36
he would not have
46:37
told the animals to replenish
46:42
the earth did you get that word
46:46
re that's like you remodel
46:49
your home you can't remodel a home that
46:51
was never there
46:53
you can't replenish the earth if it
46:55
wasn't there before
46:58
so that's what he did everybody in
46:59
heaven has already seen everything i'm
47:00
telling you about
47:01
he began to take everything apart right
47:04
so that he could then redo the earth and
47:07
then he began to make the animals and
47:08
all the life back on the earth all the
47:10
growth was back on the earth again
47:12
and then he did something different than
47:13
he hadn't done before
47:15
he was going to make man in that amazing
47:20
and then there was the word stepped out
47:23
of the father
47:24
began to form adam's body
47:27
and he looks pretty good i've seen adam
47:29
and eve in heaven yes they have clothes
47:33
and yes you will have clothing
47:38
you actually get a wardrobe he can
47:42
afford more than two garments for you
47:47
aren't you glad
47:48
[Music]
47:51
i get asked that question all the time
47:55
you well your soul's exposed on your
47:57
shoes though
48:01
the soul's exposed
48:06
yeah ask somebody what the sole your
48:08
foot is if you need help just take your
48:10
shoe off and look at it
48:13
the soles exposed on your on the bottom
48:17
of your foot
48:18
you're always touching the ground to
48:19
heaven
48:23
they still have boots they have sandals
48:25
they have all kinds of shoes there to
48:27
wear beautiful things amazing things
48:29
and some of them talk to you
48:33
your clothing will change colors and
48:34
your clothes will change on you while
48:36
you're walking down the street
48:38
if you cannot decide what you should
48:39
have worn
48:42
and you picked out three things as you
48:43
walk each one will come on you
48:47
women
48:48
[Applause]
48:52
heaven is not normal concerning this
48:55
earth
48:58
it's heaven where eye has not seen your
49:01
ear heard or entered in the heart or
49:03
mind of me and god's prepared for those
49:04
that love him
49:05
except in the last it's revealed by thee
49:08
spirit of god
49:10
so that means it can be revealed right
49:13
he's doing that at an accelerated rate
49:17
and he's shown me a lot on purpose
49:21
so he wasted hell i'm going to go back
49:23
to the third day that's okay
49:26
he wasted hell the first day christ goes
49:28
well i'm not going to touch him on wait
49:29
and see if god
49:30
rescues him and he didn't come
49:34
and he had taken him into the they had
49:36
grabbed and put him in the far reaches
49:38
not the outer reaches i've seen there
49:39
too you don't want to know about the
49:40
outer reaches of hell okay
49:42
the far reaches of hell they dragged him
49:44
back what good is that going to do
49:46
if the god of if he shows up right
49:49
what are you going to do you can't hide
49:51
anything nothing is hidden from god
49:53
but they thought well we'll just put him
49:55
back here and hold him well the second
49:56
day came and he didn't show up
49:58
so satan's thinking well i am and now
50:00
i'm stronger than him
50:02
i was smarter than him but it didn't
50:04
work but he still lost
50:05
part of his brain because he really
50:07
thought he was going to win and he was
50:08
going to put on a show to torture the
50:09
son of god
50:10
in front of all of his hierarchy so he
50:12
sent out a message
50:14
for all the principalities and powers
50:15
come in and sit on the front row
50:18
and he moved it from the back of hell to
50:19
the front where the gates are there's a
50:21
courtyard
50:22
the gates of hell the really gates there
50:25
and they could see from
50:26
abraham's muslims he couldn't put a show
50:27
on the only ones who could see would be
50:29
abraham's bosom right
50:30
he's going to put a show on showing that
50:32
he's more powerful than god i'm a torch
50:34
of the son of god
50:36
he wasn't the one that was going to
50:38
torture
50:40
so here comes the third day right he's
50:43
got everything set up
50:44
all the prince pallies and powers the
50:46
big guys are all sitting right there in
50:47
the front row
50:48
i actually was i saw that i was there i
50:50
saw all the little demons screaming and
50:52
yelling
50:52
all they do is scream and yell and
50:53
complain complain and yell and blaspheme
50:56
and complain and yell and blaspheme
50:57
they they all the time because they're
50:59
they're always everybody none of those
51:00
demons like each other
51:02
they want to out do outlie out
51:05
cheat whatever they can that's what they
51:08
do to each other
51:09
and so they were like they were full of
51:11
themselves because they were on the
51:12
front row and all the other ones were
51:13
behind them
51:14
in a little while though they were going
51:15
to be glad they weren't on the front row
51:18
satan put all his uh cleanly attire on
51:22
he had made and uh all of his faults
51:25
gems well he had the gems god still put
51:28
on him if you didn't know god put
51:30
gemstones on him for a reason he had a
51:33
reason
51:34
he put he made mountings like in a ring
51:36
and set these
51:37
amazing beautiful gems there were like
51:40
thousands of them on him and he was
51:43
glorious he was glorious so he still had
51:45
that glory he thought it was his
51:47
he's going to lose it if you know what
51:50
the word says it says christ
51:52
what'd he do say it loud
51:56
yeah that's what he stripped he took
51:58
every single gemstone off of him that
52:00
god put on him
52:02
so here's the show's about to begin
52:04
satan's going to put on a show he was
52:06
talking all of his hierarchy right
52:07
and here's jesus not saying a word just
52:10
like his father
52:11
he wasn't saying a word and then all of
52:13
a sudden
52:14
there was a role of thunder and all of
52:18
hell's attention was gotten because they
52:20
remembered
52:20
what happens after that roll of thunder
52:22
comes
52:24
lightning is going to show up somewhere
52:27
and then jesus christ stands up and
52:30
there is a shout from heaven and
52:32
jesus christ starts releasing the fire
52:34
of god from himself
52:36
and melted the faces of all the
52:38
hierarchy of hell
52:40
he began to they began to burn in the
52:42
midst of hell fire
52:43
with the fire of god literally like blue
52:45
fire was shooting on his hands
52:47
and i saw them melt like wax because as
52:50
a little girl
52:51
i would see them in different places i
52:52
saw these demons and their faces were
52:54
melted like that
52:55
and like wax and i used to think what is
52:58
that
52:59
what did that what did that well i was
53:01
about to find out
53:02
and i mean literally saw them melted it
53:04
says he ruined
53:06
and spoiled principalities
53:10
and powers and made a show of it
53:13
openly and that's what he did he
53:16
literally ruined them they can't go back
53:17
they've never been able to fix their
53:19
self okay
53:20
satan can't fix you if you're in the
53:22
army of darkness and you get wounded he
53:24
can't heal you
53:26
they got parts missing you can't you
53:29
can't make them cease to exist but they
53:31
get wounded they don't get healed okay
53:35
i've seen them the holy spirit calls
53:37
them shabby debris
53:40
and if you knew holy spirit like that's
53:43
exactly what he would say
53:45
because i see the hosts going across the
53:46
sky all the time i'm a seer i see them
53:49
i see the demonic armies after they've
53:51
been in a battle
53:52
with the host of heaven they're hanging
53:54
out for dear life because nobody
53:56
wants to help each other like hanging on
53:58
they have these horrific looks on their
54:00
face because they have just been wiped
54:01
out by the host of heaven
54:04
and i said man they look really bad and
54:05
the holy spirit said i call that shabby
54:08
debris
54:10
and they go i can't think of a better
54:13
thing to call it
54:15
because they look like debris
54:18
you know something washes up on the
54:19
shore where parts of it are missing
54:22
that was them
54:29
we better be glad they don't work
54:30
together well right
54:33
we're glad they don't even like each
54:34
other right because the hosts look out
54:36
for each other they protect each other
54:39
look out for each other they're there
54:40
for each other
54:41
hell is just the opposite nobody cares
54:43
about anybody
54:45
so here comes shabby debris they look
54:48
like
54:48
shabby debris that day in hell and this
54:51
is what jesus was saying
54:52
you will never have the power to hold a
54:56
righteous man in this
54:59
place
55:03
and anyone who received christ they will
55:06
never be able to take you there
55:08
or hold you there amen yeah
55:11
and when he was done wasting the
55:13
principalities and powers then he turns
55:15
to their leader
55:17
they ran they didn't wait around to see
55:20
what was going to happen to him they
55:21
abandoned him
55:22
they left him they were running over top
55:24
of the little demons trying to get out
55:25
of the space
55:27
they were happy they weren't on the
55:28
front row
55:31
that day it worked on their behalf and
55:34
all of abraham's bosom were shouting
55:37
and cheering and yelling
55:40
and celebrating
55:42
[Applause]
55:45
because they'd already given themselves
55:46
to him now there is their messiah wiping
55:50
out the devil
55:52
he he literally he literally ripped his
55:55
clothes off
55:56
threw him on the dirt and one by one
55:58
took every single gemstone away from him
56:00
and he was left with none it was ugly
56:03
because all he had was these spiky
56:04
little
56:05
settings that god had put all over in
56:07
his wings
56:08
and his beings he was decorated
56:12
by god and now he has put false ones in
56:15
there
56:17
he's made false ones they don't look
56:18
anything like what he did
56:20
but he was he was utterly totally
56:23
completely defeated
56:24
he is a doormat he is not
56:28
over you he is under you he is under our
56:31
feet
56:32
so what is under your feet under your
56:34
feet is a doormat
56:38
isn't that what he says
56:42
then don't be afraid of him
56:45
we're not supposed to have any fear in
56:46
us right and the fear of the lord is not
56:49
that you will be afraid that he will
56:50
hurt you
56:52
it is you are afraid you will hurt
56:55
him you're so in love with him
56:58
you don't want to do anything that would
57:00
hurt the lord
57:02
that's what the fear of the lord is the
57:04
fear of the lord is the beginning of
57:07
wisdom and with all your getting of
57:10
wisdom get
57:11
understanding which is knowledge of the
57:14
holy one
57:18
don't you don't you love the word i love
57:19
it
57:21
isn't that good so there you go that was
57:23
a reality show from heaven
57:27
and then he did the the most
57:31
the greatest insult he did to satan was
57:34
to take something that not just his
57:36
he took you know he had no pride left
57:38
really out utterly stripped him of all
57:40
his glory
57:41
and he fell because of that glory but he
57:44
did something even worse than that
57:45
he took away authority
57:49
he took away authority that he had
57:51
gained because adam gave it to him
57:54
and he had been ruling with that
57:55
authority until something changed
57:57
that's one of the reasons why christ had
57:59
to come he had to come
58:01
he had to walk as a man like you and i
58:03
choosing not to sin
58:05
say not to sin he had to choose that
58:08
with his own will not to sin
58:11
because him being not just righteous but
58:13
holy
58:14
okay and then him being going into hell
58:17
and they think that they could keep him
58:19
it was devastating to the enemy when he
58:21
realized we should have never taken him
58:22
because it said if they had known
58:25
they would have never done it right it
58:28
was bushwhack time
58:30
the enemy was bushwhacked by the son of
58:32
god and so he stands there after he
58:35
stripped all this all the gemstones off
58:37
of him
58:37
he reaches down and takes away the keys
58:42
keys represent authority
58:45
they have always represented authority
58:49
and you know that if the wealthiest man
58:51
in a city back in christ's time and even
58:53
before that
58:54
the wealthiest people were given the
58:56
keys to the city
58:58
did you know that that's not just
59:00
something we do here
59:02
on earth you know when you see someone
59:04
comes to hollywood or they come to a
59:06
state they've done something great
59:07
like oral robots was actually given the
59:10
key to oklahoma city by the mayor
59:13
the mayor of the governor one of them
59:14
and they actually redeemed their self
59:18
because they were not on god's high list
59:20
because of the way they had treated oral
59:22
roberts
59:23
they scorned him they made fun of him
59:25
they judged him
59:26
criticized him in the media and the
59:29
newspapers
59:30
but before he died somebody got smart
59:34
and they apologized to him in public
59:37
they gave him the key to the city not
59:40
just the city actually they gave him to
59:41
see
59:41
the key to that city but also i think
59:43
the governor and the mayor were both
59:44
there
59:45
apologized repented on behalf of all
59:47
those who had mistreated him
59:49
recognized him for the contribution that
59:51
he had done for them
59:52
and so they gave him the key to the city
59:55
that's still significant today when you
59:58
have a key
60:00
but the wealthy people were always sat
60:02
in the city gate
60:03
back in jesus times and before that in
60:05
abraham's day the wealthy people sat in
60:07
the city gate with the elders
60:09
and they were recognized because they
60:11
they gave contributions to help the city
60:14
and so they were given keys and they
60:18
were given
60:18
money backs and they had authority they
60:21
had a say
60:22
over what went on in that city they were
60:24
recognized by their wisdom because of
60:26
their wealth
60:26
and so that's just something that's
60:28
always been well he lost all of it in
60:30
hell that day
60:31
he lost all of his authority all of his
60:34
glory
60:36
all of his a lot of respect from the
60:38
demonic because they realized then
60:40
at that very moment our lives aren't
60:42
going to be the same because now we can
60:43
be wasted
60:45
by anyone who is righteous can waste us
60:49
everyone who receives him will now have
60:52
power over us
60:56
so their lives were changing even
60:58
satan's life was changing
61:00
he had to get a lot better deception
61:03
because he no longer had those keys to
61:05
hell
61:06
death in the grave
61:10
i'm i probably won't have time to go
61:11
into tonight but christ uses those keys
61:15
he uses them for us you should be really
61:19
happy about that amen
61:22
we have so many promises given to no no
61:24
one else in the earth
61:25
except those who've received jesus
61:27
christ you have great power on the
61:29
inside of you have great authority
61:31
you have already been given dominion on
61:33
the earth don't
61:35
don't act like you're nothing don't say
61:37
you're nothing
61:38
you have great value everybody person
61:40
everyone here is valued by god
61:42
everyone here was given a gift to use in
61:46
the natural realm
61:49
in heaven you're going to use that gift
61:52
whether it's baking cookies
61:54
making a really amazing barbecue
61:57
designing apparel
61:59
designing interior design designing
62:02
amusement parks
62:03
making movies in heaven uh sports in
62:07
heaven
62:08
are played as worship yet are really
62:11
quiet how many people have never heard
62:12
me talk about this before
62:14
i know somebody who has let me see your
62:16
hands okay
62:18
it makes sense because god gave you that
62:22
gift
62:23
they are irrevocable as a matter of fact
62:26
even the wicked have their gifts and
62:28
they won't be taken away from them
62:30
you choose how to use that gift in the
62:32
earth that's why there's people
62:34
who belong to satan and they have gifts
62:37
to act or sing
62:38
or whatever it is and what they produce
62:40
is dark
62:42
because their heart is dark they're
62:45
going to have the gifts no matter what
62:47
amen
62:49
but your gift is so important that that
62:52
god calls it precious
62:53
is something special he calls you you
62:55
are a gift
62:57
every good and perfect gift that's you
63:01
comes down from the father of lights
63:03
that was you
63:06
you were light you were made out of
63:08
light
63:09
he knit you together in your mother's
63:10
womb at the time of conception that
63:12
spiritual body made out of light was
63:14
knit together
63:15
with that physical little dot of flesh
63:17
and that's when life begins
63:19
but when you came you had you were that
63:22
gift already
63:23
whether it was someone who was going to
63:24
sing or be a musician
63:27
dance create a clothing apparel
63:30
food spices roads highways
63:34
anything you see in this place was
63:36
created by somebody
63:38
it was designed and invented by somebody
63:40
you wouldn't have anything to wear to
63:42
walk on
63:43
to sleep on to sit on to look at
63:45
entertainment places to go and enjoy
63:47
yourself you wouldn't have highways to
63:49
drive on planes to go in
63:50
those were gifts god sent people to be
63:55
and all those gifts are used in heaven
63:59
for everybody who lives there so it's
64:02
not boring
64:05
yes they have stylists there they have
64:07
salons there
64:08
they color your hair with light
64:12
this is heaven culture everyone in
64:15
heaven has color in their hair
64:18
so wear it
64:19
[Music]
64:23
it's like art is considered a form of
64:26
art okay
64:28
they also have the culinary arts in
64:30
heaven
64:31
everybody eats food and they love it
64:35
it tastes better than anything you've
64:36
had on the earth
64:38
and don't argue with me because the
64:40
mirror's supper of the lamb
64:41
is not grapes and crackers
64:46
if the lord of glory was going to have a
64:48
supper
64:51
he made everything that ever existed
64:53
he's not going to give you just grapes
64:57
there'll be unending food everywhere
65:02
everything you love to eat with no
65:03
weight gain or food allergies
65:08
and i i happen to know that that wedding
65:11
supper
65:13
is going to last a long long
65:17
[Music]
65:20
time
65:22
he has a really big house
65:24
[Laughter]
65:29
this is just reality time i guess we're
65:31
having a reality heaven show
65:34
of things that happen throughout time
65:37
okay
65:38
even elijah loves to tell the story of
65:40
the prophets of baal
65:42
because he saw what happened in the
65:44
spirit realm
65:45
when all that went on so when you go to
65:48
heaven now and he shares it
65:50
it has a whole different meaning
65:53
like when you get to heaven and you get
65:55
to see how christ wasted hell
65:58
you will shout and scream forever
66:04
there was the day satan was kicked out
66:06
there was a day he was crushed down
66:08
he had authority stripped from him he
66:11
was unseated
66:13
from his authority that he operated in
66:15
the earth for
66:16
generations and ages because something
66:18
new was happening
66:20
the messiah was on the earth and then he
66:23
went and died
66:24
for us so that every every sin you ever
66:27
commit
66:27
when you repent and say when i repent
66:31
it will be forgiven he will cleanse me
66:34
from all unrighteousness
66:37
like it never happened
66:44
heaven absolutely celebrates every time
66:46
somebody
66:47
gives herself to christ especially all
66:50
the family members who never get to
66:51
never miss it every family member saw
66:54
all of your family get born again
66:57
they saw the babies being born they saw
66:59
the weddings
67:00
every birthday on your birthday they go
67:03
in heaven get a gift and put it in your
67:05
mansion that's being built
67:06
so when you come there every year you
67:08
were apart they have a gift for you
67:11
you got a lot of family you'll have them
67:12
up to the ceiling
67:14
probably going out the doors
67:19
your pets will be there
67:24
taking over your mansion
67:27
if you had a whole lot you probably have
67:29
heaven's zoo
67:34
because he has a sense of humor beyond
67:38
not just his creativity is beyond what
67:40
you imagine his humor
67:42
is beyond anything you imagined
67:45
and you will not stop laughing
67:48
okay you will laugh till you fall on the
67:50
streets of gold
67:52
and people step over you
68:00
everybody wants to know you the
68:02
disciples will come to greet you
68:04
the prophets we have prophets watching
68:07
us right now
68:08
from heaven they're watching this
68:09
meeting right now while i talk about
68:10
them
68:12
okay we have the the ancient prophets we
68:15
have the
68:16
new ones who just passed home to heaven
68:18
and are enjoying their reward
68:20
and their celebration in the throne room
68:23
i know i've already seen kim clement up
68:25
there
68:27
i've seen oral roberts billy joe
68:29
daughtry i've seen many people great men
68:32
and women of god i've seen them in
68:33
heaven
68:34
i've seen celebrities in heaven that
68:36
made it up there like john
68:38
wayne lives in cowboy heaven
68:46
did you think they wouldn't have on
68:49
what was his gift cowboy movies
68:55
and they don't even have to have ratings
68:57
on them aren't you glad
69:01
all family friendly every single one of
69:04
them
69:06
when i used to speak in hollywood i
69:07
would say if you don't want to use that
69:08
gift you better you better go to heaven
69:10
because you won't use it down there
69:13
not only do not have breakfast in hell
69:15
they don't have movies in hell either
69:16
okay
69:17
you don't get popcorn you get nothing
69:20
in heaven you have this little menu that
69:22
appears and you pick what you want and
69:24
there's your food right there while you
69:25
watch the movie
69:28
the movie that is being captured
69:30
probably not far from where you're at
69:32
shown instantaneously in these cedars in
69:34
heaven they're called reality theaters
69:37
it was the very first place they took me
69:41
they could have taken me anywhere in
69:43
1996
69:44
i was caught up to heaven for the first
69:46
time jesus warned me
69:48
walked through the wall of my home while
69:50
i was doing dishes although i spent a
69:52
lot of time in prayer it wasn't during
69:53
that time he walked in while i was
69:55
washing dishes
69:56
not my favorite thing to do i tell
69:59
people i'm not susie homemaker okay
70:02
i am a business person but of course i
70:04
raised three daughters
70:06
i was a wife i had to take care of my
70:08
home
70:09
while i was doing everything else at the
70:11
same time and so jesus walked through
70:13
the wall of my home he said go sit down
70:15
the father and i are going to start
70:16
taking you on tours of heaven
70:19
and i didn't say no
70:23
and the first place it took me was to
70:24
have a fun place because i knew there
70:26
was a throne room
70:28
i knew there were certain places already
70:30
in heaven i knew they were there i knew
70:31
about the river of life it talks about
70:33
it in the word of god
70:34
it says heaven is a country and it's a
70:36
city so i knew they had both
70:38
even if i hadn't seen them i knew they
70:39
were both there go read hebrews 8.
70:41
correct it's in hebrew right it says
70:44
heaven is a city it's a country
70:46
yeah so go read and hebrews actually
70:48
talks a lot about heaven
70:50
that's where the great cloud of
70:51
witnesses is talked about the great
70:52
people of faith have passed on to
70:54
so go read hebrews it talks about heaven
70:57
so i knew there were certain things
70:58
there
70:59
but and i was delighted i thought there
71:02
was probably something fun to do i
71:03
didn't realize
71:04
that heaven is almost 50 50. half fun
71:09
and half profound when his children came
71:13
home he had to have something for them
71:14
to enjoy and do
71:16
and so yeah i was the first place i was
71:18
taken uh jesus came
71:20
in the person yes i knew it was him i'd
71:23
actually seen him cut a few times on the
71:24
earth before he walked through the wall
71:26
of my home
71:27
i've known him since i was four years
71:28
old i got saved twice age four and age
71:30
five
71:33
and this was 1996 when this happened so
71:35
i had had
71:37
encounters with angels i could see i was
71:39
always a seer i'd see the demonic
71:41
operations i see
71:42
heaven's operations all around me my
71:45
grandmother had some of that in her my
71:47
dad had encounters with angels
71:48
it was a way of life it wasn't like
71:51
strange something strange to me
71:53
but it was absolutely delightful to see
71:56
that there's
71:57
so many fun things to do in heaven and
72:00
what's in my books are encounters i had
72:03
and how people got stunned when god
72:04
would take me up
72:05
let me stand by their family members who
72:07
had just passed away i heard them
72:09
talking about their life on earth i knew
72:10
the family members names i knew what
72:12
they looked like
72:13
even though i had never met them on the
72:14
earth then god would walk me through
72:16
their mansions i would see how the
72:18
mansion was built i knew what was on
72:19
their property
72:20
and then he would bring me back down and
72:22
then he would give me
72:23
their family members names and phone
72:25
numbers on the earth
72:28
if he can take you to heaven and show
72:31
you stuff if he knows there'll be hair
72:32
on your head
72:33
he knows all your phone numbers right
72:38
and i would write it down he'd have me
72:39
call he'd have me type everything down
72:41
i heard and saw and then it would call
72:44
these people and say
72:45
i didn't have pink hair back then when i
72:47
used to do that okay he still shows me
72:49
people but
72:49
but when i started this whole thing i
72:52
didn't have pain care
72:53
and i say uh i believe god has shown me
72:55
something about your family member in
72:57
heaven would you like to know what it is
72:59
and i didn't know these people i i
73:01
didn't know they didn't even know how i
73:02
got their number
73:02
i didn't want to tell my got their
73:04
number i just said
73:05
god has shown me something and they will
73:08
go who are you talking about and i say
73:09
their family member's name
73:12
they would get they would i couldn't see
73:14
but i knew they were shaking on the
73:15
other end of the line
73:16
and they go uh yes i want to know
73:21
will you meet me at the mall will you
73:23
meet me at the park because they sure
73:25
weren't going to invite me to their home
73:28
they never wanted to take me to their
73:29
home they never ever ever took me to
73:31
their home
73:32
and i would show up and i would have
73:34
everything typed down on a piece of
73:35
paper
73:36
god even gave it a title did you know
73:38
god loves to name things
73:39
he gave it a title like it was a script
73:42
and i wrote it like it was a script i
73:44
put
73:44
everything in quotes that jesus said
73:46
that i heard them say
73:48
you know i described the aromas the
73:51
emotions
73:52
the colors everything the frequencies
73:56
that were there
73:57
how they traveled what was in their
73:59
mansion what it looked like what their
74:00
favorite colors were what their gift was
74:02
because they were using their gift
74:04
and i didn't know anything about them
74:06
and i tell them to sit down
74:08
and i would hold the paper up here so i
74:10
didn't look at them
74:11
and i just began to read and i would
74:13
hear them laugh
74:14
and cry and cry and laugh and laugh and
74:17
cry
74:18
and they would shake and when i was done
74:20
i'd say
74:21
do you believe god showed me this about
74:23
your family member in heaven and it
74:24
wasn't for me
74:26
it was for them and they go i don't know
74:29
you
74:29
i never met you but you told me things
74:32
only my family member would know
74:34
so i have to believe you saw my family
74:37
member
74:38
they were so absolutely undone and then
74:40
they began to tell me
74:41
they confirmed what i saw because i knew
74:43
what they were doing and i knew what
74:44
their gift was because you used that
74:46
gift in heaven
74:46
whether they were a florist in heaven or
74:49
they're designing
74:49
apparel in heaven uh whether they were
74:52
over the youth in heaven which the 13
74:54
year old girl was put over the
74:56
youth of heaven and she was 13.
74:59
and her whole life she planned to be a
75:01
youth pastor
75:04
and she met her kids in her elementary
75:05
school in her middle school
75:07
everybody loved her i heard from her
75:10
mother after i shared all the stuff i
75:11
saw her with her great grandfather that
75:12
looked like he was in his 20s
75:14
and he was taking her on rollercoaster
75:16
rides in the amusement park
75:19
and i mean huge roller coasters like the
75:20
biggest one is called the rush
75:22
it leaps off the track goes across the
75:24
sky to another part of the track
75:31
yeah i thought that was pretty cool and
75:34
the wild thing was the angels were
75:36
riding them too
75:42
they were riding them too i could not
75:45
see the end of this amusement park i've
75:47
been there three times i could not see
75:48
the end to it
75:50
kids got in bubbles and rode over it in
75:52
bubbles or you went by
75:54
you went and learned how to fly like
75:55
superman then you flew over it
75:59
guess who teaches you how to fly
76:03
christopher reeves
76:07
i hear your thoughts
76:11
he got born again
76:14
he got born again what did he do
76:18
on earth he was superman right
76:23
he teaches you to fly in heaven
76:29
so i'm telling you this is all this is
76:31
in my first trip to heaven
76:33
and i remember every aroma every emotion
76:36
i remember i remember every word that
76:38
people said i remember every creature
76:40
that i saw what they look like their
76:41
flowers saying they changed colors
76:43
the host of heaven were there there was
76:45
these beautiful angels that were green
76:46
like dust like green emerald dust
76:49
stepped out the waterfalls and they
76:50
cared for the waterfalls and the streams
76:52
in heaven
76:54
and they were feminine looking they were
76:58
so captivating their song was so
77:00
captivating so i remember
77:02
all that in my first trip and christ i
77:05
remember christ
77:06
took me aside before he brought me back
77:08
and he goes i want you to tell them on
77:10
the earth
77:10
there'll be many people in heaven they
77:11
never expected to see there but they
77:13
prayed them
77:14
in if they don't give up on them
77:18
we will not give up on them if you
77:21
belong to me
77:22
i won't let your words drop to the
77:23
ground
77:25
and i got undone i think it was the most
77:27
spectacular thing that happened when i
77:29
was there was when he told me that
77:30
because he said it will give hope to so
77:32
many people
77:34
because he's a good god isn't he
77:38
and so i saw this young girl was talking
77:40
to her great grandfather as they're
77:41
walking down this path going through
77:43
when you're going into a new part of
77:45
heaven there's gates that are always
77:46
open
77:47
there's just like columns with gates
77:48
there's not walls
77:50
inside heaven and and that's they were
77:52
going through these big purple and gold
77:54
gates and they were going to the
77:55
amusement park i didn't know that at the
77:56
time
77:57
and so the lord said get up there so you
77:59
can hear what that young girl is saying
78:01
and she was talking about her mom
78:03
that they had a great relationship when
78:04
i see my mom again i'm going to kiss her
78:06
on both cheeks
78:07
i'm going to share everything that's
78:08
happened to me up here in heaven i wish
78:10
she knew i was a youth leader in heaven
78:13
and then and she just kept talking then
78:15
i saw them go on a roller coaster ride
78:18
and then christ brought me back and i
78:20
got her mom's number and called her and
78:22
the funeral had just happened and she
78:24
was her at that time her only daughter
78:27
and uh although i was told later that
78:30
she was profited over by a prophetess
78:32
that
78:33
she would have a very short life but she
78:34
wouldn't pack the whole world for christ
78:37
which she was because of the testimony
78:40
and so when i was sharing this with her
78:42
mom outside jc penney's
78:45
at a table at the mall she got undone
78:48
and
78:49
she began to tell me after i told her
78:51
all the stuff i saw i saw on the roller
78:53
coasters i heard the words that she said
78:55
and she she was crying and weeping and
78:56
she said that what i told you i've never
78:59
known you've never met you i've never
79:00
don't know you but you said things only
79:02
my daughter knew she goes the day before
79:04
she died
79:05
the day before they buried her i was in
79:07
her room and i saw a journal under her
79:09
bed
79:09
that was written she was like seven her
79:11
daughter was 13 when she passed away
79:13
she said i start to go through it and
79:14
look at the pages and i found written on
79:16
the pages
79:17
these words last night i dreamed i died
79:19
early and went to heaven early
79:21
i saw my great grandfather and i went on
79:23
roller coaster rides
79:26
i didn't know that journal was there
79:29
it was wonderful but he only gave me a
79:31
peak so as fast as the roller coaster i
79:33
fell back to earth
79:36
and her mother was the only one who knew
79:37
about that journal
79:39
and i didn't know her mother you know
79:41
what god was doing
79:42
he was giving me evidence that heaven
79:44
was not only real but it was fun
79:47
she said her daughter every day would
79:49
kiss her on both cheeks before she went
79:50
to school when she came on she shared
79:52
everything
79:53
that had happened to her life in her
79:55
life during that day
79:56
and she had planned her whole life to be
79:58
a leader
79:59
a youth pastor and a leader that was her
80:02
goal and she was doing that in heaven at
80:04
age 13.
80:06
i heard her say you know that um i'm
80:09
cheering my mom
80:10
on you know she didn't know she couldn't
80:12
see me okay people never saw me in
80:14
heaven
80:14
but i heard all these words and she said
80:16
that she was a cheerleader
80:18
and her favorite colors were blue and
80:19
white she was wearing a blue white tunic
80:21
top and pant
80:22
when i saw her it was her favorite color
80:24
even on earth so you still have your
80:26
favorite colors in heaven
80:28
and so all these things everything i
80:30
said that i wrote down that i remembered
80:32
was significant to her
80:34
she's never been the same since then she
80:36
said she was my only daughter they tell
80:38
me i can't have children god said tell
80:40
her
80:40
that she will have children i'll give
80:41
her children and she has two
80:43
twins right now ten-year-old twins with
80:46
strawberry blonde hair like marissa had
80:48
blue eyes and strawberry blonde hair
80:50
twins and they have encounters in heaven
80:55
so we have a good god that cares about
80:58
you that cares about me
81:00
you won't miss your destiny when you go
81:03
to heaven
81:03
none of your children will miss their
81:05
destiny whatever he chose them to be
81:08
here
81:08
and that gift he gave them if it was a
81:10
dancer there'll be a dancer in heaven
81:12
if it was a cookie baker there'd be a
81:13
cookie baker in heaven if it was a
81:15
fisherman there'll be a fisherman in
81:17
heaven
81:17
if it was to create and invent all kinds
81:19
of neat
81:21
a high-tech gadgets they actually have a
81:23
place called techno city in heaven
81:26
where all the geeks live
81:30
and they can create all kinds of just
81:33
the wildest craziest
81:34
things you even beyond what we have here
81:36
on the earth although i saw some of
81:38
those being brought to the earth
81:41
because they have an idea zone in heaven
81:44
and you see all these little sparkles in
81:46
it like a million little pieces of
81:48
glitter
81:49
and every one of them is an idea an
81:50
invention and god sends he takes a wave
81:53
of that and sends it over the earth and
81:54
it drops all these ideas and inventions
81:56
in our minds
81:58
and whoever grabs that idea
82:02
and creates that idea that's why i see
82:05
things
82:05
on the earth already that i've seen in
82:08
heaven
82:10
they come from him does it say that they
82:12
come from him
82:13
yeah that's how he sends them isn't that
82:16
amazing
82:19
so god has a lot of plans for us right
82:21
here on this earth
82:23
right now everybody in here is special
82:25
because you're alive right now
82:28

82:33
kingdom age
82:34
to live heaven culture to demonstrate
82:36
and manifest for god
82:38
it's not about how much education you've
82:40
had it's not about what race you're born
82:42
in
82:43
it has nothing to do with any of that it
82:46
has to do that you belong to jesus
82:48
christ that you have given your life to
82:50
him
82:50
you've received him he put you here for
82:53
a purpose he gave you authority power

weapons
82:56

83:01
and he's also right now in this time
83:04
and people are always asking me you know
83:07

83:09
marketplace because i will create heaven

83:14
assignment was to reveal it

83:49
masterpieces with a light wand
83:54
i saw people with drive-through tattoo
83:57
powers and they put it on with light
84:00
like what marking belongs
84:04
to god it was stolen by the enemy
84:08
and he put his marks on people for
84:10
generations
84:12
there's a scripture in psalms that says
84:15
some people
84:16
worship me in in song some and dance and
84:19
some will put my marks on them
84:23
joyce meyers read that now she's getting
84:25
a tattoo
84:27
if joyce myers can do i don't know who
84:29

84:41
thank god for joyce
84:43
she keeps us real doesn't she i can't
84:46
wait to see what she's going to pick
84:50
we're living in a new time like i was
84:52
explaining
84:53
john the baptist brought a new time with
84:55
him
84:56
there were new ways to do things okay
84:59
that had nothing to do with the past
85:01
and a lot of people rejected it because
85:03
they knew
85:04
god had said to do it this way well in
85:07
that time he did things a certain way he
85:09
himself does never change
85:11
but he is a great creator and he does
85:13
bring new things to the earth all the
85:15
time
85:16
and people go well if i can't see it
85:18
line by line written well it doesn't say
85:20
he's going to have microwaves do you
85:21
have one
85:23
it doesn't say he'll have cell phones
85:24
but do you own one
85:26
okay it doesn't even talk about cars but
85:28
do you have one
85:30
yes because as time goes by
85:34
new things are brought to the earth and
85:36
invented
85:37
that we use to to improve our life is
85:40
that correct
85:43
that so that doesn't mean there's going
85:44
to be that you won't see new things
85:46
you've never seen before
85:48
and these are things i'm talking about
85:49
that will help all of humanity
85:51
to either in to either make your life
85:54
easier
85:54
or to make you have a happier life a
85:57
healthier life
85:59
a more informed life there are new
86:01
things coming to this earth
86:03
i saw roads that we traveled on that
86:05
were made out of light
86:07
and the fuel was the light
86:12
i'm glad someone's excited
86:13
[Laughter]
86:16
i i was shown these new things we will
86:19
have hologram computers
86:22
we can reach in and take the things out
86:24
of the light and look at them and put
86:25
them back in there
86:31
i saw several major diseases
86:34
including cancer that did not even exist
86:36
on the earth
86:41
it'll be abolished just think how much
86:43
that'll change your life new fuels
86:45
one is coming from outer space
86:51
are you all excited saying man because
86:54
you're staring at me
86:59
do you know how much that will change
87:02
our life we won't need the fuel from the
87:06
desert
87:07
or the sheiks we won't even need the
87:11
coal from underground
87:12
okay we won't even need solar energy
87:16
i'm not talking about solar energy a
87:19
whole fuel that god already put
87:21
up there and all they need is the night
87:24
the right receiver
87:26
to bring it down in the transmitters in
87:28
everybody's home
87:29
to fuel your entire home and i saw what
87:31
they look like
87:33
they're about this big and you can move
87:37
it wherever you want to
87:39
you go in the middle of desert and camp
87:40
and have have energy
87:46
your bug zappers won't be fly swatters
87:48
anymore
87:53
because i take one when i go and i want
87:56
one that big
87:59
because i don't like bugs when i was 16
88:03
at a youth camp and i was finally
88:05
invited to a banquet by someone who was
88:07
brave
88:09
my mama bought me this pretty dress had
88:11
white lace sleeves to here and my neck
88:12
was up to here
88:14
and i went and took that thing that was
88:15
hanging in the cabin i put on a walk-out
88:17
to go meet my date for the banquet
88:19
and something was moving up my sleeve
88:22
i already told you i don't like it want
88:24
no little bug it was this big
88:28
and it was crawling up my arm this way
88:32
and i was really shy so i wasn't going
88:35
to tell anybody
88:37
it was one of those grasshoppers black
88:39
and red ones you know those things
88:42
look like they came either from hell or
88:44
from some other planet
88:48
they look like they could take over the
88:49
world and wanted to
88:51
they had an attitude if you ever looked
88:53
him in the eye
88:55
i wouldn't i wouldn't suggest you do
88:57
that
88:59
when i'm i'm here like this right trying
89:01
to calmly talk
89:04
first time in my life i went anywhere
89:07
with the opposite sex
89:08
at all i got this pretty dress on
89:12
and and the sleeves you know i was i was
89:15
i was real skinny i mean
89:16
real skinny and so that's the only
89:18
reason why that thing was able to get up
89:19
there
89:20
and i've got lace you know lace does not
89:22
move okay you can't open it up and shake
89:24
something out
89:25
so this thing is crawling further and
89:27
further and i'm like i'm trying to hang
89:29
on to it right
89:30
and i'm like i thought it was gonna
89:32
faint in front of them
89:34
that's not gonna be a good first
89:36
impression
89:38
excuse me and i i was a really fast
89:40
runner i chased my brothers all the time
89:42
from my mama
89:44
i ran so fast back to that cab and
89:46
locked the door and i threw everything
89:48
off
89:48
i was going to take everything and there
89:50
was that big oaky thing this big
89:53
i didn't kill it i didn't want to go
89:54
anywhere near i'm like what i'm gonna do
89:56
i had to wait for it to walk away
89:58
from my clothes so i could put him back
90:00
on and go back out there you know
90:02
about 15 minutes later and he goes are
90:04
you okay i am i'm really good
90:08
i'm all good right now and i sent my
90:11
friends in the cabin to
90:13
for the demise of the grasshopper
90:16
so when i go camping i take big things
90:19
to deal with the bugs but when you get
90:21
this energy from space okay
90:23
you can get the biggest bug zapper and
90:26
probably put it around your entire tent
90:28
so anything that comes out there is
90:30
going to get zapped before it ever gets
90:32
inside
90:34
it was the most amazing thing it was
90:35
just like a they had this thing
90:37
that you pulled it down from space and
90:40
everybody had them
90:41
they just had them in their homes i saw
90:43
them line highways
90:45
and a hologram light they didn't have
90:47
lamp posts like solid like this
90:49
they had little things like this and all
90:52
they did was have to place them where
90:53
they went and
90:54
attached them to the ground they had one
90:55
little station a little kind of a thing
90:57
like that
90:58
and when they hit it the lights shot up
91:00
from the ground and let the entire
91:02
highway all the way down
91:05
you didn't have to dig in the ground
91:08
plant wiring run
91:10
all the way down somewhere and hook it
91:11
up to something this was
91:13
a new form of energy that will change
91:16
our
91:16
world the missionaries wherever they are
91:20
they can have
91:20
power all the time no matter where you
91:23
are out in the ocean on a boat it
91:25
doesn't matter where you are because
91:26
it's going to draw it down
91:28
from space and he took me quite a while
91:31
showing me this took me into the future
91:33
and showed me someone this is going to
91:34
be a great day for everybody
91:36
and he said in your life in your
91:38
lifetime which is probably forever
91:40
it is going to happen
91:43
i'm not planning to die i don't know
91:44
about you
91:48
i'm staying till he's done with me i'll
91:50
let him choose that amen
91:51
[Music]
91:54
i'm not planning to escape by my rapture
91:56
rug
91:58
because even we can't decide that right
92:00
so i'm just trying
92:01
i'm just trying to share a little bit
92:04
about what is coming into your lives
92:06
it will affect you your kids your
92:08
grandchildren great grandchildren great
92:11
great great great
92:14
great great grandchildren
92:17
[Music]
92:18
there have been quite a few people that
92:21
have been caught up and taken
92:22
over 100 years into the future i've been
92:26
taking almost 150 years into the future
92:29
and the perils times had not happened
92:32
but it got better and greater and more
92:35
powerful
92:36
because the body of christ was standing
92:38
up and being who god called them to be
92:41
they no longer tolerated darkness or
92:44
evil
92:44
they weren't participating with it by by
92:47
complaining and saying what they didn't
92:48
have
92:49
and who they weren't they stopped saying
92:51
words
92:53
of negativity you can't live a positive
92:56
prosperous life if your soul is
92:58
continually being fed
93:00
negative words you just can't do it and
93:03
actually if all you do is take in the
93:05
doom and gloom you're not even going to
93:06
be happy
93:07
do you know god told me in order to
93:08
create an event you had to be happy
93:12
you had to be happy you know actually
93:15
isn't happy better than sad
93:18
do you know there's more things released
93:20
in your body
93:22
that are good when you are happy when
93:25
you're sad and oppression comes things
93:27
start
93:27
changing even inside the way that your
93:30
body is forming i don't know
93:32
all those details about that okay i
93:34
don't know those details don't care
93:35
about them
93:36
i just know that your inward workings of
93:38
your body begin to not be good
93:41
and if you live around negativity all
93:43
the time then that's not good for you
93:46
but you can change the atmosphere even
93:47
where you live
93:49
go in your room and say i'm not
93:50
participating with all these words i'm
93:52
evicting all these words out of the
93:53
atmosphere of where i live
93:55
i don't have to tolerate them i'm
93:56
releasing the life of god the power of
93:58
god the presence of god right here this
94:00
is the atmosphere i'm gonna breathe
94:02
it doesn't matter who owns that place if
94:04
you were there you have the right to
94:06
change the atmosphere you live in
94:10
you can imagine if the body of christ
94:12
ever gets this about the new
94:14
time and starts operating like that how
94:16
much change are we going to bring we
94:18
were sent here to help
94:19
change things is that right christ came
94:22
and changed many things just a few short
94:25
years he was here
94:27
he rocked this world
94:32
it's our time to put on a show
94:36
this is all about the show begins you
94:39
saw you heard about the show in heaven
94:41
and let me tell you when all that was
94:42
going on of the deception of the angels
94:45
it wasn't just like calmly quietly done
94:48
that's not the way it was done
94:49
it was great deception and lucifer never
94:52
told them i'm going to take over and be
94:53
evil and kill steal and destroy
94:55
he didn't say that to any of those
94:57
angels he said i'm going to be greater
94:59
than god
95:00
i care more i'm wiser he doesn't know
95:03
what i'm doing he doesn't know what i'm
95:04
saying
95:05
so i'm going to make sure everybody has
95:06
wealth everybody has power
95:08
we can all celebrate together while i
95:10
rule
95:12
and then he would have his own concerts
95:14
and said he trafficked his wares
95:17
he showed off that he could create
95:20
because he was highly anointed for that
95:22
and he would do that and he'd draw
95:24
angels to himself let me tell you
95:26
a third of them followed him but
95:28
two-thirds didn't follow him
95:31
and angels are real beings like you and
95:34
i
95:35
they're not married okay god had some
95:37
mercy on them
95:45
i'll be married 40 years to the same
95:47
human being this november
95:51
and i'm not picking anyone else okay
95:54
been through it once
95:56
didn't just survive but i'm victorious i
95:58
actually is still very much in love with
96:00
my husband
96:02
and everybody knows it's a journey isn't
96:04
it
96:06
you learn to love and die and love and
96:09
die and love and die and love and die
96:12
to someone dies more than the other
96:14
there's a lot more love
96:16
and then you keep loving having grace so
96:18
they can finish dying to their self
96:21
and then it's wonderful
96:26
[Laughter]
96:29
but you won't be married in heaven
96:31
you'll be best friends
96:33
you'll remember you were married you'll
96:35
do things all over heaven together
96:38
and you will show off who is your
96:40
husband who is your wife on the earth
96:42
you celebrate all over heaven you go
96:44
look at isn't she gorgeous
96:46
it's the most beautiful thing you've
96:48
seen this is who i was married to
96:51
on earth yeah and they won't talk about
96:54
any of the hard times
96:57
they won't talk about any of the crazy
96:58
times okay
97:01
oh you share them
97:06
if you had pets you share
97:09
them because you live right next door
97:14
and you're
97:18
i was a you're parent are you a better
97:21
parent
97:24
they'll probably visit you more often
97:32
you share them it's like children like
97:34
when when um
97:35
when parents come home to heaven if you
97:37
if you had a miscarried little baby
97:39
and you get that little baby you share
97:40
them they stay with the mother stay with
97:42
the father
97:42
but this is it most of those people go
97:44
everywhere together in heaven
97:47
and and there's no like there's not like
97:48
sleepovers okay although people move in
97:50
and stay with you for a while i'm just
97:52
preparing you
97:54
i'm giving you a heads up warning right
97:56
now
97:57
when you come home to heaven all of your
97:59
family will move into your mansion
98:02
they probably already got their space
98:04
picked out
98:07
because they have missed you and they
98:10
want to be with you
98:11
okay this is a good news if you're going
98:14
on a tour tell them to enjoy their self
98:16
till you get back
98:18
only they're probably going to follow
98:19
you on the tour everybody goes on tours
98:20
of heaven
98:24
it doesn't matter if you stay with each
98:25
other it doesn't matter okay
98:27
i saw a whole i call them community
98:29
mansions it was like a big hub
98:31
like a big huge massive common area like
98:34
probably like half of denver and off of
98:37
this
98:39
this com common area which was so
98:41
supernatural was things you all enjoyed
98:43
doing together on the earth it was uh
98:44
even if it could include outdoor stuff
98:46
by the way you can't say it was all like
98:48
under a building no i'm talking about it
98:50
was everything you enjoyed doing on the
98:52
earth together as a family
98:54
and then off of this are all these
98:56
massive mansions
98:57
coming off almost like a wheel with
98:59
spokes
99:00
and every spoke would be like i don't
99:02
know i saw mansions the size of a city
99:05
so i can't ever even say
99:07
how big these mansions were and so
99:09
everybody had their own space because
99:10
you come home
99:12
as his son and his daughter
99:16
okay that's how you come home because he
99:19
is your father
99:20
when you come home he recognizes your
99:21
son and your daughter
99:23
and he gives everybody their own space
99:24
and you will be very glad you have it
99:27
you will love whatever it gives you to
99:29
be so supernatural you could never
99:30
afford to pay for it buy it or even
99:32
build it here
99:33
and it's going to be built around your
99:35
gift the thing that is your passion that
99:36
you love the most
99:40
and then you go on tours all over heaven
99:42
and christ invites you to his own
99:43
private mansion
99:45
where he throws a big party for you and
99:46
invites all the disciples the apostles
99:48
the prophets to come and see you and
99:51
they're coming there to meet you
99:53
he sends a special chariot or carriage
99:56
to come and pick you up and then he has
99:59
you decked out like a king or a queen
100:01
and then you come and he escorts you
100:03
into his place
100:05
and introduces you and everybody
100:07
celebrates that you're there
100:10
and then you eat like forever
100:12
[Music]
100:14
he has a massive ballroom is the biggest
100:16
part of his mansion because he loves to
100:18
dance
100:19
and on all the all down the walls are
100:21
like king's tables laden with every kind
100:23
of dessert you can imagine
100:27
and his mansion sits in this field of
100:29
flowers that are like six foot tall
100:31
all of them sing the most glorious songs
100:35
they are worshiping the lord of glory
100:37
they will all know your name they will
100:38
all welcome you as you come down this
100:40
magnificent drive
100:42
to say everybody say jesus deserves his
100:45
own place
100:48
just like us and he has one
100:52
but he made a way so that you will never
100:55
be away from him
100:56
do y'all like this reality show tonight
100:59
[Laughter]
101:01
some people are hearing it for the first
101:02
time if we're live streaming are we live
101:03
streaming
101:04
some some of these people for the first
101:06
time in their life are probably getting
101:07
rocked
101:08
you know their mind is probably still
101:10
going bonk after the first time i talk
101:12
to them about something
101:14
because that's what heaven does to you
101:15
when you get there you walk around like
101:20
you don't even know what to say you're
101:22
looking at everything you're undone by
101:24
the ground by the grass by the sky
101:27
by the beings by the sounds the images
101:29
of frequencies people riding on their
101:30
worship you know
101:32
i mean beams of light shooting by and
101:34
it's a person coming from somewhere in
101:35
heaven
101:36
you step into these transport kiosks
101:38
that are light beams shooting out and
101:40
you ride on the light
101:42
to places around here and you're walking
101:43
down these streets of gold if you can
101:45
you can look in them you can it can
101:47
actually see your image in the streets
101:49
of gold it looks like uh
101:50
i don't know it's transparent gold but
101:53
it's beautiful you can't even tell the
101:54
depth of it
101:55
you can't there's gems everywhere
101:57
massive gems everywhere
101:59
the mulch and the flower beds are gems
102:02
like real gems
102:04
and the angels will come sometimes and
102:05
grab them up and throw them down to the
102:07
earth
102:08
and that's how they get in the meetings
102:12
so you're you're being undone by
102:13
everything that you're walking by
102:15
everything that you're seeing
102:16
in heaven and you'll never stop feeling
102:18
that way
102:20
you will never stop being undone it
102:22
doesn't matter if people have been there
102:24
500 years a thousand years 2000 years
102:28
they're still surprised by god he's he's
102:31
always creating new things
102:33
putting new things through there
102:34
discovering new things it's so huge and
102:36
massive
102:37
you know i mean one day i don't even
102:38
know if we'll get to seattle before he
102:39
makes the new earth
102:42
isn't that amazing
102:46
i i love him i love him more every day
102:49
and people go how can you carry that
102:51
because he lets me
102:54
he lets me carry it i have a i have a
102:57
i can't even remember in the natural
102:59
words anymore
103:01
i have a photographic memory he gave me
103:03
that from the time i was a little kid it
103:05
helped a lot in school
103:07
i look at a list one time you never have
103:09
to look it again i remembered everything
103:10
it said
103:11
i'd read one thing like you know two
103:13
weeks later we had a test and i would
103:14
pass every test
103:15
because i remember but he wanted
103:17
somebody with a with a photographic
103:19
memory to do this
103:20
so they could remember everything i
103:21
remember the thousands of times i've
103:23
been there i remember everything
103:27
i remember every detail i remember the
103:29
aromas will get you undone
103:32
the christ himself carries an aroma
103:35
and i can go places and i know he was
103:37
there
103:39
it's beautiful it's a beautiful smell
103:41
but i also smell the other side
103:44
i know when they've been in places and
103:46
it's putrid
103:48
it smells like death so yes
103:52
they both exist heaven exists hell
103:55
exists
103:56
just like the bible says okay you have
103:59
to read the word
104:00
to know it if you don't know the word
104:04
then he can't bring it alive to you if
104:06
you don't read the word he can't bring
104:08
he can't highlight stuff i know how many
104:10
people have ever happened you've read a
104:11
scripture so many times in one day you
104:13
read it and it comes alive to you
104:15
[Applause]
104:18
if you read the word you are storing it
104:21
in your soul
104:23
and in a moment when you need it that's
104:25
how come it comes
104:26
up in you because you put it there
104:29
yourself when you read it
104:31
i play the bible somewhere in my house
104:34
and it's always feeding my soul you can
104:36
feed your soul at night while you're
104:38
sleeping
104:39
and i don't know why more believers
104:41
don't but i play
104:43
powerful anointed worship 24 hours a day
104:45
in my home
104:47
because he inhabits the praises of his
104:49
people
104:50

104:52
on a cd
104:54

105:25
these spiritual kings who will walk in
105:27
the earth
105:29
that's whoever runs after that
105:33
those are eternal levels of authority
105:36

105:37
me
105:38

105:41

00:13
while they're doing that
00:15
jesus is right behind me on the platform
00:19
[Applause]
00:20
[Music]
00:23
he's right there
00:31
[Music]
00:33
[Applause]
00:42
wow
00:47
he has an agenda
00:52
it's called america
01:09
all right
01:16
when she started flagging that sound you
01:20
heard was
01:21
his train filling the temple
01:25
and there was an angel bigger than this
01:27
building outside
01:29
he was flapping his wings he was moving
01:32
his wings
01:33
and then all the others stepped through
01:35
him and filled here
01:36
and then jesus stepped right through
01:37
that wall
01:40
that's what you were feeling his
01:42
presence he was overwhelmed and undone
01:45
by the worship
01:47
he loves the hearts of those who worship
01:49
in spirit and in truth
01:52
and he walked up to me and said i'm
01:54
going to speak today
01:56
and tell this world what i think about
01:59
[Applause]
02:06
america
02:12
who am i
02:15
i am that i am i am from the beginning
02:23
and the end
02:26
there is no man who has lived on this
02:29
earth that i did not make
02:34
that my father did not carry until they
02:37
were sent here
02:41
we did not create evil
02:46
that was birthed in a created being
02:48
because he chose it
02:50
do not choose darkness it will overtake
02:54
you and consume you
02:58
it will blind the light we put inside of
03:02
you
03:04
no one will take my country
03:08
no one will remove my name
03:11
off of your documents or your buildings
03:15
no one will remove the blood strikes
03:19
on your flag
03:21
[Music]
03:22
no one can stand before me and say
03:25
they are greater than i am
03:29
for i am going to rebirth america
03:34
it will be greater than it ever was
03:36
before it has not even seen
03:38
the peak of its greatness
03:42
america is great because i created it to
03:45
be great
03:46
it is my gift to the nations
03:51
i created it to stand with my people in
03:54
israel
03:56
for america is a friend of israel
04:00
i hid america in their name
04:04
j e r
04:08
u s a
04:11
l e m
04:14
if you want to know where america is in
04:16
the bible it's in the name
04:18
of jerusalem
04:19
[Applause]
04:22
for i have hidden it i hid
04:25
it before i birthed it the enemy wants
04:29
it
04:29
if he thinks he can make decrees over my
04:32
country
04:34
i will wipe them out
04:36
[Applause]
04:38
i will overturn every wicked law every
04:41
evil decree
04:42
i will remove every wicked person
04:47
for i have chosen someone to sit in the
04:50
white house
04:50
and he will sit in the white house as
04:54
president
04:56
if you do not like him then you say
04:58
nothing
04:59
because you're speaking against my plan
05:01
you don't know my ways and my thoughts
05:05
for the generations before him in his
05:07
line
05:08
paid a price with their life for the
05:09
kingdom
05:11
he could not escape being great
05:15
he's been thrown into this because i
05:17
called him into this
05:20
pray for him pray for everyone who he
05:22
chooses that he chooses by my will
05:26
but i will no longer tolerate the evil
05:30
the decay in this land i will no longer
05:34
that will not will not
05:38
tolerate the enemy trying to overtake my
05:42
country
05:44
for my name is written in its documents
05:48
for i was with those who wrote those
05:51
documents
05:52
even their names have been slandered and
05:55
lies told about them
05:57
i will not tolerate it
06:01
this is a new age i call it the kingdom
06:04
age it is time for my
06:07
people to lay down their differences
06:10
stop
06:11
your footing you are helping the enemy
06:15
i say in this day and age you come
06:18
together
06:19
for the world must see you loving each
06:21
other
06:22
you have to love each other first before
06:25
you can love others
06:27
my blessing falls on agreement
06:31
for those leaders in my house
06:35
my house not your house
06:40
my house it is mine and i am taking it
06:45
[Music]
06:46
back
06:48
those leaders in my house who are not
06:50
yielding my spirit
06:52
i will remove you
06:54
[Applause]
06:57
in this day it is critical that you work
06:59
together
07:00
that you love one another this is not
07:03
about you
07:04
being important this is not about you
07:07
becoming somebody
07:10
it's about you showing me my love
07:13
my truth my purposes my plans
07:18
lay down your plans and find out my
07:20
plans
07:22
because i choose to make america greater
07:25
than
07:26
ever was before i say
07:30
the world will race after the pattern
07:33
i'm going to put in america
07:36
i see the world run after the products
07:39
made
07:40
in america for i
07:44
have made america
07:48
it is mine many
07:51
have paid a price for this land
07:56
i will not overlook their blood crying
07:58
out
08:00
where is justice and liberty and freedom
08:04
i will not tolerate freedom being taken
08:07
from this land
08:10
that even the children cannot be saved
08:14
in their own schools
08:21
i will not tolerate it
08:25
you will see the hand of your god move
08:26
mightily in this land
08:31
i know i made this world i do not hate
08:34
the earth
08:36
i made it with my own hands
08:39
from my father spoke and anything you
08:43
spoke i created it
08:47
i even changed my very image
08:50
to come here and walk amongst you
08:54
i know your weaknesses
08:58
i know your hurts and your pains
09:03
i would no longer tolerate it in this
09:06
country
09:08
for light shall abound and the darkness
09:12
for generations shall be pushed back
09:16
regions of light and glory will be
09:19
created in this country
09:22
that sin and crime will not be able to
09:24
abide in
09:26
because i will erase even the very first
09:28
steps to the demonic who have threat
09:30
there
09:30
[Applause]
09:34
but you must stand up and decree and
09:36
declare
09:37
and make rulings for in this time my
09:40
kings
09:41
my spiritual kings will lay out decrees
09:44
and rulings and i will do them
09:47
because they will live holy and they
09:49
will obey
09:50
they will let me have my way
09:57
if you want to know me you must pursue
09:59
me
10:02
i do not control i lead
10:06
and i love but you cannot keep
10:10
insisting in heaven your own way you
10:13
can't have my will in your way it does
10:15
not work
10:18
because my father's kingdom my father's
10:21
kingdom the kingdom of heaven
10:23
is coming to this earth even now the
10:27
hosts
10:28
millions and millions of them have been
10:30
sent from heaven
10:32
to work with the believers to help
10:36
defend them and pull down the
10:37
strongholds
10:38
they are your weapon in this day and age
10:46
for i have chosen this time on the earth
10:51
my father has chosen this time on the
10:53
earth
10:55
you can either participate or you can
10:58
stand and watch it happen
11:00
but in eternity you will be so thankful
11:05
that you participated
11:08
i do not want to hear any more trashing
11:11
and bashing i don't want to hear evil
11:16
and wickedness and darkness coming out
11:18
of your mouth
11:19
if you say you are mine then stop it
11:23
for i have said this day i offer you
11:25
life and death
11:26
i said choose life because every time
11:29
you speak
11:30
death you will perish your soul will
11:34
perish
11:39
you must love but you must
11:42
share the truth you cannot embrace
11:46
the other false religions you are not
11:48
helping them
11:50
do not read their articles or their
11:52
doctrines
11:55
because they will clutter your soul
11:59
you read my word you live
12:03
by every word that is spoken
12:06
every spoken word you live by it
12:11
the written word is a guideline
12:14
but the spoken word never stops
12:17
revelation
12:18
is being released from heaven like never
12:20
before in this day
12:23
but the enemy also is releasing
12:26
deception
12:30
you do not want to be caught in
12:31
deception
12:36
you need to be free and full of me
12:40
you need to be dangerous against the
12:42
plans of darkness
12:44
for i created you perfectly and
12:47
amazingly
12:49
and then i gave you the power that i
12:51
carry
12:54
operate in it every day of your life
12:57
it's not something you use in just a
12:59
time of crisis
13:01
you live in it it's a lifestyle you rule
13:04
it's a lifestyle when you rule
13:07
the enemy will run
13:11
but i will not tolerate
13:15
the words that are being spoken against
13:17
this nation
13:19
stop cursing it and stop asking us to
13:23
curse it
13:26
it says in your own papers and in your
13:28
songs
13:29
god bless america
13:33
i cannot curse it if you have stated
13:36
that
13:38
you must bless america
13:42
bless it in every way bless your
13:45
families
13:46
bless your friends even bless your
13:48
enemies
13:50
for when you do that it gives us the

20:49
to go around this world
20:52
this is my earth and the fullness
20:55
thereof
20:57
and i am changing things because my

21:04
and i will come and heal their land and
21:07

wow i think he voted
22:24
whoa
22:37
can you bring my phone margaret
22:43
i love it when god confirms things
22:48
and he made a great distinction between
22:51
himself and the father didn't he
22:54
he wanted to know who he was
23:00
i made a little list of things i knew he
23:02
wanted me to talk about
23:04
and then most of this was already in the
23:06
songs of the decorations
23:09
and besides i didn't know he was going
23:11
to speak today i knew i would speak for
23:13
him
23:16
he came as the lord of glory and by the
23:19
way
23:20
that crown he wears his father took it
23:23
off his own head and put on his sunset
23:26
[Applause]
23:33
he was wearing that crown
23:38
i'll see if i can share a few of these
23:41
things
23:44
if i can remember how to operate this
23:45
right now
23:48
in heaven you wouldn't need this that
23:50
awesome
23:55
wow i knew he was coming when i saw that
23:58
angel
24:01
he's the head of his train when his
24:04
train his
24:05
train are the are the angels or the host
24:09
that's what makes up his garment
24:10
[Laughter]
24:15
i was really figured he was coming
24:18
because of the level of praise but when
24:20
i saw the angel standing outside
24:24
i knew he was coming i've been sitting i
24:27
sat in my sanctuary one time
24:29
and my pastor would always have me sit
24:31
on the front row so i could sketch
24:33
because i've always seen in the spirit
24:34
realm he had me sit there and draw
24:35
everything i saw in the spirit realm
24:36
during the service
24:39
and until one day when i was on the
24:41
floor
24:43
on the front row because jesus came in
24:46
his train
24:47
filled our sanctuary and then he came in
24:49
in his own
24:50
flaming chariot
24:54
and i was sitting on that front row
24:55
thinking he's gonna say something
24:59
and i mean his eyes were that flames of
25:01
fire his hair was white as wool
25:03
his garments were so brilliant i almost
25:06
couldn't look at them
25:07
and his chariot stopped and he got off
25:09
and came up to me i was on the floor
25:13
and he said you tell my people i only
25:16
came once a savior
25:18
when i come back i'm coming as king
25:31
[Applause]
25:32
and when he just spoke he was wearing
25:35
his crown
25:36
[Laughter]
25:39
he came as king today
25:42
[Music]
25:44
he wants our children to have a future
25:47
[Applause]
25:49
he wants our children to know how to
25:51
rule
25:55
kick the enemy out of their school
26:00
train the kids they won't ever forget it
26:05
he's serious i lost my notes
26:08
shaking i'm shaking
26:12
wow
26:15
i've seen the father come when he comes
26:19
his rainbow penetrates the building
26:21
before he ever gets there
26:24
i've seen him i've seen him come with
26:27
the living creatures the two
26:29
that carry his throne there's four
26:32
around his throne but there's two that
26:33
hold up the arms of his throne
26:36
they have four heads you know it talks
26:38
about the ones with the four hats
26:40
kneeling they're about 80 foot high
26:45
and their backs hold the armrest of the
26:48
father's throne
26:51
when it talks about the wheels the
26:53
wheels come out of them and they begin
26:55
to move and that throne
26:56
moves like this
27:02
yeah yeah he was talking about him
27:08
not humans talking
27:12
but they were talking to super natural
27:14
humans here today
27:16
and around the world if you belong to
27:18
him you're a supernatural
27:20
human not of this world
27:25
he reminded me last night you are the
27:27
aliens
27:32
he has repeatedly told me there are
27:35
no aliens
27:38
there's no other race out there that you
27:40
might happen chance
27:42
find in case you don't like heaven
27:46
there's heaven and there's the other
27:48
place
27:50
and after that if you choose that it's a
27:52
lake of fire
27:54
there's no other places to abide that's
27:56
right
27:58
i'm choosing into that i've seen the
28:02
other place you don't want to go there
28:09
i'm just going to keep sharing
28:12
this message is called made in america
28:17
so i am wearing america
28:23
i've always been very patriotic i have
28:26
voted in every election
28:28
from the time i was 18 i voted
28:32
your votes count you need to vote
28:36
[Music]
28:38
in this election you're going to vote
28:40
for light or darkness
28:42
there's no other platform
28:45
that's your choices you choose light or
28:49
darkness
28:52
i would say choose light
28:57
that same god that just spoke is about
28:59
to display himself
29:01
in signs and wonders around this world
29:03
that he will do himself
29:05
but there'll be ones that we do for him
29:12
this world has to see us doing those
29:13
supernatural things
29:15
because we belong to a supernatural god
29:17
[Applause]
29:20
you need to see it the true image of the
29:22
living god
29:24
one who loves the one who lives holy
29:27
and yet they have more fun in heaven
29:28
than they do on this earth
29:30
if you're going to live heaven culture
29:32
you have to have fun
29:35
he wants every intercessor to come out
29:37
of the closet
29:39
and you have fun before you go back in
29:44
because fun will be your greatest weapon
29:46
in this season
29:58
he said you need to have all night fun
29:59
parties
30:01
instead of all night prayer meetings
30:04
because when you come back for the
30:05
prayer meetings
30:06
there'll be a whole lot more powerful
30:08
than when you did it before the fun
30:13
this is a strange thing to the body of
30:16
christ
30:17
we thought they had to be serious and
30:19
profound well sirius and
30:21
went to sour somewhere it all went south
30:25
somewhere
30:26
[Applause]
30:28
because when the world hears a believer
30:29
they don't think wow fun
30:33
they don't think wow they love us wow
30:35
have you ever seen a group of people
30:37
that really cared about each other
30:39
that is not what they talk about
30:43
then i go man i want to be like them
30:47
but they will
30:49
[Music]
30:51
they will i saw a time in the earth when
30:53
people wanted
30:54
friends to be believers they wanted
30:56
believers for their friends
31:01
he said it sounds well but it will be
31:03
popular to be the friend of a believer
31:08
because jesus did that in his day
31:15
i like heavens playing better than ours
31:21
you can't leave the holy spirit out of
31:22
anything
31:24
amen i don't know if you know this but
31:28
in the baptist convention i may be
31:30
mistaken about the location
31:32
but i'm not mistaken about the
31:34
declaration
31:37
that they've had a meeting and someone
31:40
high up said
31:41
we can no longer resist ignore
31:44
or shut out the activities and the
31:46
receiving of the holy spirit
32:07
it literally was spoken
32:11
it was either at the beginning of this
32:13
year or the last part of last year
32:19
spoken to the highest hierarchy in the
32:21
baptist convention
32:25
i i believe i'm trying to remember this
32:27
correct i like to be correct but
32:28
somebody was sent out to do a survey
32:30
i don't know if it was to all the
32:31
missionaries it was somewhere specific
32:34
to look at
32:35
groups of what their people were doing
32:37
and they came back with a
32:38
shocking report they had all fallen
32:42
way behind because they visited many
32:45
missionary places
32:47
and the ones that were flourishing and
32:48
prospering were friends with the holy
32:54
spirit
32:56
and then they just looked in general
32:58
when they saw they began to look in
32:59
general just everywhere
33:01
and they were seriously shocked
33:04
and very concerned for their
33:07
denomination
33:09
so they really went to the whoever this
33:11
person was had the right and the
33:12
permission to speak to them
33:14
and they said we can no longer ignore
33:16
this we're going to fall behind everyone
33:19
else
33:20
and there's no life there's life where
33:22
the spirit is
33:28
they're being set up for the kingdom age
33:30
[Applause]
33:34
because you do know the holy spirit
33:35
moved his operations to planet earth
33:41
now he's still in heaven because he's
33:43
everywhere but he moved his operations
33:44
from heaven to earth
33:46
because jesus sent him here
33:52
all three of them
33:55
in the course of time are required
33:58
because of what they did for us
34:00
to move from heaven
34:04
people go where's that in the bible i
34:05
will tell you where it is in the bible
34:09
jesus was sent first the word
34:12
he was the word the host still call him
34:15
the word
34:16
they have worked closer with him than
34:18
almost any of the other angelic beings
34:20
because he is the lord of hosts he's the
34:23
lord of the host
34:27
he was involved in all the army
34:29
activities in heaven
34:31
when he used to fight for israel they
34:33
fought the human beings watch out
34:38
they did they did at that time they
34:42
fought the human beings
34:44
and and destroyed them angel
34:48
wiped out i forgot 185 000 something
34:50
like that it was crazy
34:53
they were god's chosen people they
34:55
represented him in this earth
34:57
they were in trouble of course evil and
35:00
wickedness
35:00
which is always controlled parts of this
35:02
earth and people on this earth
35:05
you know the devil can't do something
35:06
himself
35:08
he has to have a living soul to control
35:12
we've always said he needs the spirit
35:14
well he does he possesses the spirit
35:16
but he still has to have control of the
35:17
soul because the soul is what you act
35:20
with
35:21
it's what you think you choose and
35:23
display
35:24
that would be you that's why he wants to
35:28
destroy your soul
35:31
that's why god has given revelation on
35:33
the soul
35:34
you are a living soul that is a
35:38
powerful declaration that's one of the
35:41
things about being a little mini god
35:44
you know you're not that ye are gods
35:45
it's not some wild weird thing we're not
35:47
taking over heaven
35:49
we're not going to become god but we're
35:51
supposed to operate in the way they
35:52
operate
35:54
when they speak things happen when you
35:56
speak down here things are supposed to
35:58
happen
36:00
they have creative power why do you
36:01
think we create an event down here
36:04
we do it because that's their likeness
36:05
it's what they do
36:08
really it's not hard when you get
36:10
revelation of understanding of the
36:12
scriptures
36:13
that we were made in his image that
36:15
means he has a body
36:18
god hazard body the father has a body a
36:21
powerful body
36:23
he's magnificent his hair is white as
36:25
wool i i touch it sometimes when he
36:28
takes me up to the stone it's alive it's
36:29
living it's moving
36:30
everything in heaven has life in it it's
36:32
alive he wants our earth to be alive
36:35
he wants you to be alive we're supposed
36:38
to be carriers of life
36:40
because he carried life and centered
36:43
this earth
36:44
you're supposed to carry life
36:47
that's his image
36:50
the word was magnificent he was fully
36:54
spiritual he did not look like jesus
36:56
christ
36:59
he changed his very appearance
37:03
he didn't have flesh
37:07
the father put flesh on him like
37:10
melchizedek
37:11
had melchizedek has flesh
37:15
he's always had flesh he's ahead of a
37:18
whole tribe of angels that have flesh
37:21
before we were sent here angels are made
37:24
in tribes that's why there's tribes on
37:26
the earth
37:27
that's why there's tribes in israel
37:30
that wasn't a new thing god did the
37:32
angels are created in tribes
37:34
we had a whole tribe here today
37:39
you know tribe of the host here
37:43
god is very detailed and specific when
37:46
he makes anything
37:48
we need to be the same way
37:51
he likes to use the word strategic
37:55
he's very strategic in his plans right
37:57
now he's got strategy
37:59
laid out and designed
38:03
i've been shown the next couple hundred
38:05
years for america
38:09
it's gonna get a whole lot better
38:14
because when god steps in life comes
38:16
with him truth comes with him
38:19
creativity and blessings come with him
38:25
this habitation you have no way can you
38:28
even imagine in your mind or even myself
38:31
and all that i have seen and been shown
38:33
and i've seen supernatural shocking
38:35
amazing things but even i
38:37
cannot contain the scope of what is
38:40
going to happen through this habitation
38:43
and it's starting in this generation of
38:45
people
38:46
it's a typing group of people we're that
38:50
type and group of people right now
38:51
because
38:51
you know why you're alive right now
38:54
that's why you're included
38:56
he timed your birth on the earth to be a
38:58
part of this
39:01
some of you may not have any idea what
39:03
i'm talking about
39:04
i'm talking for god this is how he talks
39:09
he has a plan follow his plan
39:13
you have to know him to do this
39:16
okay you can't go out there and rule and
39:17
reign over the darkness if you don't
39:19
know jesus christ
39:21
remember the seven sons of skeva
39:24
that was a bad day that was a bad choice
39:28
and there were seven of them not one
39:31
they thought they could use his name
39:33
and take over demons they got overtaken
39:37
they probably never tried that again
39:41
you're not going to get away with saying
39:43
you're using the power of god on this
39:45
day
39:48
his name is holy
39:52
but this is also a day of greatness
39:56
and excitement and celebration
39:59
and i've learned something from the
40:01
father if i do not celebrate every day
40:03
of my life what i do
40:05
i might become weary sometimes it's hard
40:09
work
40:10
it's wonderful work it's amazing work
40:13
i don't have a life because i gave it to
40:15
him
40:18
you know it's easy to celebrate god and
40:21
the vision
40:22
when i'm alone with him but i have to
40:25
live with people
40:29
who are not on the level i'm on and i
40:32
want them to be there
40:34
don't drag them there it does not
40:39
work i'm learning to love my family
40:44
until god can change them and deal with
40:46
them it's not my job
40:48
to deal with them i cannot stop
40:52
and fix everything for everybody out
40:54
there that i hear from and it pulls on
40:57
my heart
40:58
because i love people but i cannot fix
41:00
you
41:01
i give you revelation if you apply it
41:04
then god's power will fix you
41:08
god will not let me do personal ministry
41:11
don't call my office and ask for it and
41:13
then say i'm mean and ugly because i
41:14
won't do it
41:16
this is what god said if you obey it
41:19
will all be
41:19
okay i am not going to disobey him
41:24
i wasn't called to be in the five-fold
41:26
ministry i'm not a pastor hallelujah
41:29
bless every pastor on the earth god i
41:31
want
41:32
supernatural blessings this day to begin
41:35
to fall on their sacrifice they've given
41:37
their life for
41:38
they've been bitten by sheep spitting by
41:41
sheep
41:42
talk bad about sheep
41:46

41:49
they've been abandoned and rejected by
41:51
sheep laughed at by sheep
41:53
even the clothes they where they picked
41:55
on the way they designed the church they
41:57
picked at it
41:58
they've pointed fingers at their family
42:00
when their own family is in deep trouble
42:04
you sheep straighten up amen because
42:07
when you're in trouble guess who you
42:08

[Music]
42:12

42:14
rescue already be loving them
42:16

42:18
[Applause]
42:23
honor needs i tell you heaven culture
42:27
honor there's love and honor honor is
42:29
the second biggest thing in heaven
42:31
culture
42:33
you have to honor each other
42:37
don't fight over what you don't believe
42:39
or agree on talk about what you do
42:41
[Music]
42:42
every single one of you have gifts and
42:44
god put them in there
42:46
we need each other we are not an
42:49
island to ourselves you cannot
42:52
isolate yourself when you isolate
42:56
yourself
42:57
now i'm not talking about when god calls
42:59
you away to himself
43:01
he does that he used to do it to me all
43:02
the time but i still had to come back in
43:04
the mass
43:05
and the tribe i lived in and love them
43:08
and care about them
43:10
not everyone in my family is happy about
43:13
me
43:16
no is that is that amazing
43:22
i'd have to say half of them are excited
43:23
the other half don't care
43:27
someone come correct me i just love them
43:30
i ask god to bless them
43:32
i have their face at my war room and i
43:34
loose the holy spirit on them all the
43:38
time
43:40
then there are some who are part of what
43:41
i do
43:43
then i gotta be there one-on-one with
43:45
them
43:48
where they learn to guard their soul and
43:49
lose stuff from their soul
43:53
this is a new time on the earth we need
43:56
to live
43:57
a new way okay you need to be like jesus
44:02
he changed his very appearance
44:06
the holy spirit was very close to him
44:12
before the earth was made and they got
44:14
consumed with all of us
44:16
they would do things together there's a
44:17
whole area
44:19
beyond heaven i call it the retreat
44:24
even they need to get away sometimes
44:28
that's why you need to do that when god
44:31
calls you apart to be with him that's
44:32
one thing
44:33
but getting away just to have fun is
44:35
something that's just as necessary
44:38
have fun with your family for heaven's
44:40
sakes they need to see some fun
44:44
let's all say this father i ask for it
44:48
and receive funds
44:52
to have fun when it comes
44:56
i'll use it to have fun because that's
45:00
why you're sending it
45:07
we are his children we can ask more than
45:09
just our basic needs being met
45:13
you have not because you asked not
45:16
people always think that's
45:18
the spiritual side of everything but we
45:20
live in a physical realm
45:22
in these physical bodies it needs to
45:24
have a break you need to take a break
45:27
even jesus took a break from the
45:29
disciples of heaven's name he needed it
45:33
hard-headed i know what it's like to
45:36
live with fishermen
45:39
[Laughter]
45:45
i know in scottish fishermen
45:52
i know the scottish ways very well
45:54
[Applause]
45:56
and i'm irish and jewish
46:02
whoa what a dynamite
46:11
yeah it was quite interesting we'll be
46:12
married 40 years next year
46:16
it's been a wild journey
46:18
[Applause]
46:19
marriage is bliss in the good times
46:26
in the fun times always
46:30
that's why god sends the angels on
46:33
assignment with the opposite kind of
46:35
personality
46:39
they're not given a marriage nor married
46:41
they are not
46:42
unhappy about that
46:46
the ones that chose it before on the
46:48
earth have regretted it ever since
46:56
but he'll send the serious ones with the
46:57
comedians
47:00
there are comedian angels i have met
47:03
some
47:07
they're the ones that give you those
47:08
awesome jokes to tell
47:11
that's them
47:12
[Music]
47:14
that's that's who they are and they do
47:17
it on assignment and the holy one
47:20
profound one does not want to hear the
47:21
jokes they are focused on their
47:23
assignment well so is the other one he's
47:24
just enjoying it while he's on
47:25
it
47:29
they sharpen each other
47:33
and then god makes it even better he
47:35
sends them home on sabbatical to have
47:37
fun at the front
47:38
at the playport they have a playport
47:41
it's in the sky
47:42
then they have to go and have fun
47:44
together
47:46
after they completed their assignment
47:48
[Music]
47:50
together
47:52
you're going to get a whole new view i'm
47:53
going to come and just speak about
47:54
angels one time
47:55
you will laugh most of the time and then
47:58
you will pray for them
48:06
i'm gonna keep reading i'm listening
48:12
if i ever write people go you need to
48:14
write a book of angels if i did it won't
48:16
be what you expect
48:22
we'll have the section holy profound the
48:24
fun
48:27
they have them i'm going to just start
48:30
sharing what he said he wanted me to
48:32
talk about how he made america
48:35
and the people who made america great
48:38
god's always had people and he would he
48:42
would assign them he would anoint them
48:43
is that strange
48:45
he anointed people that weren't even
48:46
believers
48:49
he gives anointings the anointing draws
48:53
people
48:56
and that's why people have the ability
48:57
to influence people
48:59
it's an anointing sometimes the enemy
49:01
gets ahold of those people and they
49:03
are anointed still anointed he doesn't
49:06
take the anointing away
49:07
but then it draws people to the darkness
49:10
and that's why we have so many dark
49:12
movies and dark songs
49:14
because they have darkness in them
49:16
because if they were filled with light
49:17
that same anointing would create
49:19
amazing fantastic things that's why he's
49:21
getting hollywood saved
49:24
[Applause]
49:24
[Music]
49:28
i'll be going there next month
49:30
[Music]
49:32
i have a key to hollywood a key to l.a
49:36
actually
49:37
he even showed me the seven golden
49:39
angels that stand around
49:41
uh la
49:44
the ones that the city was named for
49:47
[Music]
49:49
los angeles the city of angels
49:54
the first time i went i saw them and
49:56
this person who brought me started
49:58
taking me to significant places so i
49:59
could tell what i saw in the spirit
50:00
realm
50:02
i saw those seven angels they were
50:03
taller than mountains
50:06
and they had these vials standing over
50:08
the city waiting to pour them
50:11
and they poured them before i left
50:14
because god had was pouring out an
50:16
anointing on hollywood
50:18
to help show the truth and bring light
50:21
and change the producers directors the
50:24
scriptwriters the special effects people
50:26
[Applause]
50:29
hollywood is right
50:31
[Music]
50:31
[Applause]
50:33
they'll still make intense exciting
50:35
adventurous
50:36
funny movies but it will not have
50:39
darkness or evil in it
50:41
and if it has evil they'll be overcome
50:43
and defeated by the good in there
50:46
not everyone will be a bible movie but
50:49
the whole
50:49
the whole life of heaven and what god
50:52
wants to be seen and lived on the earth
50:54
will be portrayed in every movie
50:57
there'll be goodness there'll be power
50:58
there'll be light there'll be hope
51:00
in all of them
51:03
yes the blessed coast
51:08
and so yeah a lot of stuff was planted
51:10
in california i laugh every time i hear
51:12
a prophet say it's going to fall off the
51:13
face of the earth
51:15
i just saw it fall off into the ocean
51:18
went well you didn't see a literal thing
51:21
you must have seen the darkness falling
51:23
off into the ocean
51:25
[Applause]
51:28
he's always had people in america that
51:31
would make america great
51:33
our forefathers were some of those we
51:35
grew up
51:36
we my age grew up in school knowing the
51:40
truth about them
51:41
and what they did for our country
51:45
and they always talked about god they
51:47
talked about god we prayed every day in
51:49
school
51:50
remember those days in the public school
51:51
we prayed
51:52
[Music]
51:55
that's because god created america
51:58
and then he anointed people who paid for
52:01
america to be great
52:04
people have usually talked down the
52:05
people where great wealth those people
52:07
great wealth help build this country
52:10
they're people who built whole states
52:13
they founded host states the beginning
52:14
of host states
52:16
but two very wealthy people who founded
52:18
almost all of florida
52:20
and paid for all the universities and
52:22
the hospitals and the great places and
52:24
uh many the beautiful structures and
52:26
buildings they were they were paid for
52:27
for about two by two people
52:31
so he would he would choose people with
52:33
great wealth and anoint them and have
52:34
the wealth
52:35
because they put it back in the country
52:38
he's going to do that again
52:41
he's already he's already picked up
52:43
people to do that
52:45
and then god said in america i mean you
52:48
the people he meet the people in america
52:53
and he said then i set up a miracle i'd
52:54
be run by the people for the people
52:58
he put those words in there that was him
53:00
to have freedom of liberty
53:02
to worship him to separate the uh
53:05
the um the government from interfering
53:08
with the church
53:10
not the other way around separation of
53:12
church and state
53:14
church is first separate church
53:17
so the state cannot interfere with it
53:23
that's true then what he himself talked
53:27
about the gospel
53:28
he had me put in there the notes i had
53:30
already he already given me
53:32
two-thirds of the gospel that's not for
53:34
me that's from him
53:36
was paid for by people in america
53:41
other countries were involved they
53:43
always happened great revivals happened
53:45
the welsh revival
53:46
there's so many in scotland where my
53:49
husband's from the covenanters
53:51
those people were the holy people in
53:53
scotland
53:54
they were powerful powerful people in
53:57
ireland i can't even begin to tell you
53:58
about ireland with colombo and patrick
54:01
and
54:02
they had friends of angels angels were
54:04
their friends
54:06
and they didn't worship them they sent
54:07
them on assignments
54:09
bangor island ireland to this day
54:12
is called the valley of the angels
54:17
and they still see these luminous angels
54:20
in that place
54:22
because of the price people paid to pay
54:25
theirs so they had prices paid somewhere
54:27
in our own country there was a 100-year
54:30
non-stop prayer meeting
54:35
and people would work for each other
54:37
just as they could be in this this cycle
54:39
of prayer
54:39
they were crying out for god to come to
54:41
this country and do something
54:42
a 100 years before we were here before
54:46
we who were sitting here were here
54:48
they did that people have always paid a
54:51
price
54:52
here in america died many of them died
54:54
even in the founding of it
54:59
and then he made america to stand as
55:02
israel's friend
55:03
i already had that in my notes to stand
55:06
and be a friend of israel
55:09
and sometimes we weren't always that
55:10
friend but that is going to change
55:13
[Applause]
55:16
it will change many things will change
55:20
he said i established and made and
55:22
birthed in america
55:23
america is different from almost any
55:25
other nation
55:27
it is that's why they all want to come
55:28
here
55:30
and i know they love there's some that
55:32
love where they are but people who
55:33
really want
55:34
true freedom and liberty they come here
55:36
for that liberty and freedom
55:37
there's a lot of very good moral people
55:40
that come here because they know they
55:41
can live
55:43
they're not coming here so they can be
55:44
beat up and die
55:46
they're coming here to actually have a
55:48
life
55:50
yes and to get born again they're going
55:53
to get born again
55:55
i've seen i've already been shown
55:57
millions at a time will run into the
55:59
kingdom
55:59
[Applause]
56:01
millions of muslims will run into the
56:03
kingdom
56:04
[Applause]
56:08
he didn't tell me that he showed me that
56:17
he he he cannot ignore who ishmael was
56:22
in case you wondered this where that
56:23
whole thing came from
56:26
he's not gonna he's not gonna ignore
56:27
ishmael and who his father was
56:30
right he said
56:34
he even said they would be mighty in the
56:36
land
56:37
and they are they need to know the true
56:41
god
56:43
he said he birthed in america and made
56:46
in america liberty and freedom to
56:48
worship god in america
56:50
more freedom in america than any other
56:52
country if you don't believe that go
56:54

56:59
there's more churches in america than
57:01

57:40
somewhere that was the other
57:41
party zone and the super bowl committee
57:45
said they would come back
57:47
they had never seen such harmony and
57:50
unity
57:51
between the volunteers and the people in
57:53
the city

57:56

58:55
and patterned the military here after
58:57
heaven's military
59:00
they have a military they have an army
59:05
michael that's his job in heaven
59:08
he's the archangel over the host he has
59:11
a military headquarters in heaven
59:14
they have barracks 200 and some feet
59:16
high
59:19
i couldn't see the end of those barracks
59:24
and they were designed and created for
59:26
one thing
59:28
to destroy the actions of the army of
59:31
darkness
59:33
so they didn't have a job for a long
59:35
time
59:39
and now until lucifer decided to take
59:41
over they didn't know what they were
59:42
going to be doing
59:45
they sure did their maneuvers really
59:46
well
59:50
and it's not a tourist attraction in
59:52
heaven by the way
59:54
people go there they don't stay long
59:59
they're far too busy to stop and chat
60:01
with you
60:04
so now they've all been sent down here
60:07
isn't that exciting for them
60:14
said our military was raised up to care
60:18
to care not just for this country
60:22
but other countries
60:26
he said america has gone and defended
60:28
almost
60:29
all the other world leader countries
60:32
that stood for justice and freedom
60:36
even the small ones who had nobody
60:39
even the smallest countries they went
60:41
there
60:43
even if they weren't thanked they went
60:45
there
60:47
because we we don't like injustice
60:50
our military my husband is a marine he
60:53
will always be a marine
60:56
he forgets embarks order sometimes i
60:58
don't listen to them
61:01
if i get a kiss i will listen
61:03
[Music]
61:03
[Applause]
61:06
i am not your squadron do i look
61:10
like a squadron
61:13
i will show up in fatigues if that's
61:16
what you want me to wear i will wear
61:17
them all the time
61:20
you want me to look like this then i
61:22
better get a kiss
61:24
[Applause]
61:26
[Music]
61:30
if you think god just lets me run up and
61:31
ignore my husband you
61:33
are so wrong you need to get our dvd and
61:36
cd called passionate power
61:40
yep it was something he had me activate
61:44
no my husband i have to make him happy
61:47
make him feel important and let him have
61:48
a good time and fish as much as he wants
61:50
to
61:52
even though he smells like bait
61:56
i celebrate when he catches a fish
62:00
and when i'm gone he sends me a picture
62:02
every day
62:06
that's his gift
62:12
so god designed uh our military he wants
62:15
he wants us to have a strong military
62:17
because as long as evil wicked people in
62:19
the world that want to just kill
62:21
destroy you have to have that strength
62:24
as part of your protection
62:26
and protection for others and he said
62:29
they stood the
62:30
our military stands for uh righteousness
62:33
which
62:34
means uh in order to be in the military
62:37
uh tell you they deal with those who are
62:39
not
62:40
keeping their self in order because when
62:43
you're
62:43
in the military you live military you
62:46
represent the military
62:49
as they find out too much stuff is going
62:50
on you are in trouble
62:53
they want you to live right because you
62:56
know that's why you're there to fight
62:57
right so righteousness justice and
62:59
liberty is really the hallmark
63:02
of our military we need to honor them
63:04
more they're going to be respected in
63:05
ways we've never seen before
63:07
in the future one other
63:10
one other thing and and actually the
63:13
father
63:14
absolutely loves nasa
63:18
because they show us all of his space
63:21
art
63:23
nasa introduced for the first time to
63:25
this world god's art
63:27
in outer space maybe you never thought
63:29
of it that way
63:30
that's how he thinks of it it's not a
63:33
bunch of dust particles that came
63:34
together
63:36
he designed every one of those nebulas
63:39
spoke them into existence and then the
63:41
lord of glory made them
63:44
the word stepped out and made them
63:47
every one of them is put in a specific
63:49
place
63:51
that's why the planets aren't all
63:52
falling out of the sky
63:55
and by the way there's a difference in
63:58
using the word universe
63:59
and the word cosmos
64:04
universe is just the universe
64:07
it is not necessarily made by divine
64:09
design
64:11
but the word cosmos means a creator
64:15
designed it and made it
64:18
[Applause]
64:20
the bible calls it the cosmos
64:25
man came up with universe same thing
64:29
but it is the cosmos designed by
64:33
a creator and perfect design
64:37
i like that word cosmic we're going to
64:39
have some cosmic times on this earth
64:42
[Music]
64:43
nasa was birthed here in america and
64:46
made in america
64:48
the greatest place space exploration
64:51
facility in the world was in america
64:55
other countries pursued it
64:56
but america made it a part of them it
64:59
was also funded and paid for
65:01
by the people in america we paid for all
65:05
that stuff that went on and it meant
65:07
something
65:08
because it wasn't just discovering new
65:10
places and images there were so many
65:12
things
65:12
created just in the course of making
65:14
that possible
65:15
that we all enjoy now new technology we
65:19
never had before
65:20
new products we never had before on the
65:22
earth that increased safety
65:24
and excitement and let me tell you just
65:26
if you've never looked at those
65:28
galleries you need to go online to
65:30
nasa.com
65:32

65:35
exploration with humans is done they're
65:37
still setting the hubble and the other
65:39
one out there
65:40
we're learning more and more about what
65:42
god made out there
65:44
so they're not they haven't stopped
65:45
doing something if you ever go to the
65:47
nasa center in florida
65:49
it has turned into a huge facility where
65:51
you can tour it learn things
65:52
experience things see things they even
65:54
have kids space camp
65:57

if you want something that's high def
66:21
and you're going to use it for something
66:22
specific
66:23

66:25
of it because the people
66:26
paid for it they gave it to us how about
66:28
that
66:30
so that was something that was made in
66:31
america a first in america was nasa
66:34
and then he said some of the greatest
66:35
inventions and scientists were homegrown
66:38
in america
66:39
or america drew some of the greatest to
66:41
our country because of the freedom and
66:42
liberty they had
66:44
to create and we have worked closely
66:47
with israel and their brilliant
66:48
minds that god gave them and some of our
66:51
creativity
66:52
worked together to bring things to this
66:54
country and this time god will bring
66:56

have a whole bunch of checksuits
68:14
god is uh one another thing made in
68:17
america or birth in america
68:19
is the revelation and details about the
68:22
kingdom age
68:25
is coming from me i live here
68:29
details on heaven culture and how to
68:31
live that
68:32
how to work with the host of heaven as
68:34
your weapon
68:36
and i know it's happening in other
68:37
places but the fullness of the
68:39
of the revelation and the detail on it
68:42
he is birthing here from america as a
68:45
pattern
68:46
we will be a pattern the believers who
68:49
live here will be a pattern
68:51
for the other believers to run after
68:52
that same pattern
68:54
because then they will prosper and
68:55
flourish and push back darkness
68:59
god always raises up a type of people
69:01
when he introduces something new in the
69:03
earth
69:03
we're it that's why you're sitting here
69:07
that's why you're hearing these words
69:11
so he's birthing the kingdom age the
69:14
fullness and understanding of it jesus
69:16
introduced it
69:17
but we've never really seen the fullness
69:19
of the kingdom or even
69:20
understood what it was it's in
69:24
all of you if jesus christ lives in you
69:28
because he's an orchestrator of the
69:29
kingdom age he releases it from you
69:32
it's a lifestyle it's a lifestyle you
69:35
live in this earth
69:37
prospering and using it to build this
69:39
kingdom or take this message of the
69:40
kingdom
69:41
because the message of the kingdom has
69:43
power in it yeah it does
69:47
it's the gospel parents grab your
69:49
children parents grab your children
69:50
there
69:51
get your children
69:56
it's releasing revelation
69:59
as a pattern to follow to rule and reign
70:02
with christ
70:03
to use our powerful weapons including
70:05
the host of heaven
70:07
remember they're bored they have nothing
70:08
to do they are not defending heaven
70:12
they didn't even do anything about when
70:14
lucifer fell and one-third of the angels
70:16
god himself kicked him out
70:20
he's always reminding the devil you have
70:22
lost yeah
70:24
[Applause]
70:25
then his son reminded them in hell on
70:27
the third day when he wasted them
70:30
[Music]
70:31
he wasted them in hell demonstrated that
70:34
not only he had power and authority
70:36
but all those who follow him have the
70:38
same power and authority that he
70:41
lived in it is ours
70:44
now it's our time to demonstrate through
70:47
our life
70:47
and receiving and choosing this
70:49
lifestyle we will demonstrate that same
70:52
authority and power over
70:53
all the power of the darkness
70:56
it's because this is a new time
71:00
this is exciting i'm ex i'm getting
71:03
excited yes
71:05
he said he said um
71:12
because of what america has stood for
71:15
and was created for to bless the world
71:18
to be a light to the nations to become
71:22
a pattern of heaven on this earth
71:26
that is all of our calling to represent
71:30
heaven on this earth
71:32
it's wonderful to live in heaven but if
71:35
it's not your time
71:36
you are not going anywhere
71:39
[Applause]
71:42
our life spans are going to be extended
71:45
in the kingdom age
71:47
because we are that generation and type
71:50
of people
71:50
that will taste to the i'm talking about
71:54
the power when jesus
71:55
lives on the earth and sits in jerusalem
71:58
on the throne
71:59
man's lifespan will be extended for
72:01
hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
72:03
years
72:04
but there will be a generation on the
72:06
earth a taste of that
72:08
the power of that age well there's only
72:11
one more age after this one it's the
72:13
millennial age
72:14
so we are that people that will
72:15
experience and taste of the powers
72:17
of the age to come so everybody stand up
72:20
please
72:27
that's why you are so important to god
72:31
and the people around the world that
72:34
belong to him
72:34
you are important to god we are to
72:38
represent heaven
72:39
live heaven culture in this earth
72:41
operate like christ did on this earth
72:44
to bring hope jesus brought hope god is
72:50
not the author of doom and gloom
72:53
it is not time he could not possibly put
72:56
his wrath right now because we wouldn't
72:59
be able to do the things he wants us to
73:01
do
73:03
this is not the end of the end
73:07
it's not the perilous times this is some
73:09
of the greatest times on this earth
73:14
oh we are totally getting the wealth of
73:16
the wicked
73:20
there's many ways he's going to do that
73:21
i know one of the ways that we will do
73:23
that
73:24
is by the things we put in the
73:25
marketplace that they can't create and
73:27
they don't have
73:28
they will race after those things in the
73:30
marketplace
73:32
i was sitting there today and you said
73:34
the world will race after
73:36
made in america products
73:38
[Applause]
73:40
especially china
73:46
i don't know how they feel about that
73:49
[Applause]
73:52
i can't leave without telling you to be
73:54
very
73:55
careful about what you're buying
73:59
check out what you're buying make sure
74:01
it's a good product
74:03
make sure it's not going to fall apart
74:04
or explode
74:08
there's other countries that have been
74:09
allowed to bring things into our
74:11
countries that have no guidelines for
74:12
their products
74:14
not even their own people are protected
74:17
and they're putting they are they're
74:20
putting asbestos
74:21
in formaldehyde and let
74:25
even in toys you can get a little i'm
74:28
just telling y'all the truth okay
74:30
you can get a tester you can buy a
74:31
little tester i don't know where it is
74:33
sometimes they give them away free
74:34
probably go online and look for them i
74:36
i'd go in the store and i would look at
74:38
everything
74:39
i'm not doing that to put fear in you
74:40
i'm telling you that to protect yourself
74:42
and your children
74:44
that's why we need stuff made here
74:48
now other countries like england and
74:51
france and
74:52
italy and other countries are other good
74:54
solid countries that make
74:56
amazing products that have guidelines
74:58
for their materials
75:00
but there's others that have started
75:01
flooding the marketplace
75:03
that have no guidelines and they
75:04
shouldn't allow them in here
75:06
without checking them out they should
75:07
have to have the same guidelines
75:09
do you agree i'm sure everyone agrees
75:13
but people are not aware that almost 80
75:15
percent of all the products on the
75:16
shelves
75:17
are not good things
75:20
i look at every label it takes a while
75:24
even some of the food now is being sent
75:26
overseas to be processed
75:27
i will give you a tip organic farms will
75:30
explode in america
75:35
organic farms if you can go organic go
75:38
organic
75:40
they don't use pesticides they don't use
75:42
fillers they don't use
75:44
hormones in the in the meat and in the
75:46
animals
75:47
you know a long time ago they didn't
75:49
really do all that until they wanted to
75:51
start
75:51
mass producing stuff well one of the
75:54
things that will be changing in america
75:56
is the way we process
75:57
stuff even ourselves is going to get
75:59
better
76:01
i'm not telling you not to eat i'm just
76:03
telling you be
76:04
be aware of where you're buying stuff
76:06
they have organic markets
76:09
and if they don't have them you contact
76:11
them and tell them to bring them here
76:14
we actually ate at an organic restaurant
76:16
in denver
76:18
it's called mod market i'm giving them a
76:20
free commercial
76:21
fresh from the farm and the i think
76:24
the mills mall it's near that uh
76:28
that restaurant that has the bony fish
76:30
on it
76:34
i won't be going there if you like fish
76:37
go there
76:39
but we ate there and the food was
76:40
delicious and it was fresh all of it was
76:42
fresh
76:43
so it is increasing if you if you see
76:46
organic
76:47
you know make sure it's a responsible
76:49
company but organic farms are going to
76:51
explode because there is a generation
76:54
my two of my daughters fall in that 30
76:56
year old category
76:58
and they refuse to give any of their
77:00
children anything that is not
77:04
they eat healthy they are healthy and
77:07
every now and then they let them
77:08
splurge you know they don't say you
77:11
can't ever have a pizza
77:12
but if they do they get an organic one
77:16
learn to make them yourself
77:19
because you can buy stuff and make good
77:20
stuff amen
77:22
i don't know where that came from i
77:23
guess god cares he cares about you
77:26
but our marketplace will majorly
77:30
change in america
77:33
all right we're going to all look up to
77:36
heaven and we're going to do it
77:38
what the lord said we're all going to
77:40
say god bless america three times
77:42

77:46

00:00
everybody i hope you're having a great
00:02
day we
00:03
are right here in sunny florida
00:06
and yes it's actually sunny by the way
00:08
that system
00:10
that the weather warriors took authority
00:11
over last night is like gone
00:13
gone it's gone so thank you everybody
00:16
for participating
00:18
and because all of this that we do
00:20
belongs to god we're going to start
00:22
with everyone out there asking for grace
00:25
so you're going to learn something
00:26
before we start our q a session
00:28
you actually should do this when you
00:30
first wake up in the morning i'm talking
00:32
about grace for abundant
00:33
life maybe you never heard about that
00:36
but it's definitely
00:37
in the bible there's actually a
00:40
scripture
00:41
which you know that should be maybe a
00:44
homework assignment for everyone who's a
00:46
part of this
00:46
there's a scripture that says god said
00:50
as a child i filled my son with my grace
00:54
now this is god the father speaking it's
00:56
in the word of god
00:58
he is also the one who has the throne of
01:00
grace
01:02
jesus christ gives grace for abundant
01:04
life
01:06
god gives grace god jesus
01:11
you all know of course that i'm up very
01:13
early i didn't wear my shirt that says
01:16
you know what does it say i'm not a
01:18
morning person i'm not a morning person
01:20
and i know you're like weirded out by
01:22
this but this is my morning
01:24
right now this is my morning okay now if
01:27
you
01:28
called me at six am i probably wouldn't
01:30
even have gone to bed yet
01:31
so i'm doing this because i love you so
01:34
christ
01:35
gives grace for eternal life
01:38
that's eternal life grace that's when he
01:41
died on the cross he gave we got that
01:43
but the father who sits on the throne of
01:46
grace come before my throne of grace
01:49
to find grace for help in time of need
01:52
that is abundant life grace and you know
01:55
there's an action it says find it that
01:57
means you come and you
01:59
ask for it so as a child
02:02
god the father filled his son with his
02:05
grace for abundant life
02:06
is one of the things that helped him
02:09
survive on this earth okay
02:11
that's how he could still be happy
02:12
filled with god in heaven
02:15
abundant life grace is fueled from
02:18
heaven
02:20
if you will look up to heaven every
02:21
morning when you wake up and you say
02:23
father i ask for
02:24
and receive grace for this day
02:27
like right now i feel it it feels like
02:30
light electricity pouring
02:31
into me a lot of people don't know this
02:34
is something you can actually
02:36
get every day and it's like new every
02:40
day
02:41
and so we're all going to do this
02:42
together so everybody even here
02:44
in the studio say it after i do so
02:46
everybody can know they have to do it
02:48
father father i ask for
02:52
i ask for and receive grace and receive
02:55
grace
02:55
for this day for this day amen
02:59
amen there you go
03:02
now we are all filled with grace what
03:05
does that mean that means you're going
03:06
to be happy
03:07
things aren't going to be bothering you
03:09
for whatever you're going to go through
03:11
that day you just got grace for that so
03:14
you could live
03:15
abundantly because christ comes to bring
03:17
life
03:19
and bring it more abundantly please
03:20
don't forget that if it's the only thing
03:22
you leave with
03:23
today and i talk to you just like you
03:26
right here in front of me
03:27
and being 1 to 15 i have no problem
03:30
communicating with
03:32
people and i love people because you
03:34
know i survived them
03:36
was triumphant living with that whole
03:38
family with our alligator in the bathtub
03:40
and you know umpteen toad frogs that my
03:43
seven brothers would go out and collect
03:45
and my mom would have to set them free
03:47
every night
03:48
um so we definitely had a different
03:50
household so i love all of you
03:52
if you're bashing trash you know we're
03:54
gonna have to we're gonna have to ban
03:56
you
03:57
um but we love you anyway so i'll say
04:00
that right in the beginning i love
04:01
everybody even those who don't want that
04:02
you don't understand
04:05
don't be filled with fear that god has
04:07
more
04:09
and it's called revelation so that's
04:10
what you're going to get today
04:12
as we answer these questions that you
04:14
are asking and jen will take a couple
04:17
from the comments you know we're gonna
04:19
we're gonna we've already got a few that
04:20
we're gonna answer because we've been
04:22
promising a long time so we're gonna get
04:23
started
04:25
so uh and i do have a few more things to
04:27
share later but right now we're going to
04:28
start the q a session
04:31
awesome let's have it jan we are ready
04:34
you guys can't see me but i'm over here
04:36
off to the side
04:38
hi okay um all right so this question
04:43
is from
04:47
sharon it doesn't say where she's from
04:50
okay sharon yes and uh she would like to
04:53
know that
04:54
since there is no night time in heaven
04:58
are there bedrooms in your mansion
05:01
okay i'm sure everybody heard that but
05:03
this is from sharon a question from
05:05
sharon she wants to know
05:07
since there's no nighttime in heaven i
05:09
don't know if you knew that but there
05:11
isn't
05:12
you know there's no shadow turning
05:13
there's no darkness at all and having
05:15
the
05:15
there's different colors that come in
05:17
the sky different times well there's not
05:19
time in heaven
05:21
just waves of color come to the sky of
05:24
heaven which would
05:24
sort of change the effect of the light
05:27
coming
05:28
from god himself all light in heaven
05:31
comes from god there's no
05:32
sun there's no moon in heaven so there's
05:35
always
05:36
daylight there's always light and you
05:38
don't have per se
05:39
a bedroom in your mansion because no
05:42
one's going to be sleeping
05:43
you do have special rooms in your
05:45
mansion where they have beautiful
05:46
lounges for you to lounge on
05:48
sometimes people want to go in there and
05:50
and you still go and set yourself apart
05:52
to read the word
05:54
and even though god is everywhere in
05:55
heaven his presence is with you some
05:57
people just go to a special place in
05:59
their mansion
06:00
and just have conversations with him
06:02
sometimes your special friends visit you
06:05
and so you do have like the most
06:06
beautiful place
06:08
the most comfortable place in your
06:09
mansion would probably be like
06:11
your area where you're going to lounge
06:13
and relax
06:15
and so but per se is a bed you don't
06:17
need that
06:18
and people think how lovely and
06:20
wonderful well let me give you a clue in
06:22
the nurseries with the millions of
06:24
babies there's many nurseries all over
06:25
heaven
06:27
they don't sleep either can you imagine
06:30
being on the list to be one of the
06:32
angels that
06:34
care for these little babies and you
06:36
have to play with them all the time
06:37
because
06:38
they don't sleep either but it is
06:40
wonderful to think
06:41
that your body doesn't have to be
06:43
restored all the time like we do on this
06:44
earth your flesh
06:45
needs rest and sometimes some people
06:48
need more than others
06:49
i sleep four hours a day sometimes three
06:52
i go about 20 hours a day
06:55
then i'm going inactive and my family's
06:58
adapted to that but some people need
07:01
eight they
07:02
need 10 hours i'm so glad that i'm up
07:04
for 20 hours so let's go to the next
07:06
question jen
07:07
okay this is there's no name on this one
07:11
at all
07:12
but um they wanted to know what is
07:15
a cherub what is a tear-up
07:18
oh that's the first time i've been asked
07:20
that well it's part of the angel tribes
07:23
in heaven
07:24
and a chair of people normally on earth
07:26
if you said the word cherub
07:28
and this is an anonymous question so
07:31
hello anonymous whoever you are
07:33
[Laughter]
07:38
you ask you did a rare thing you asked
07:40
the question no one's ever asked me
07:41
before
07:43
it talks about the cherubim now it
07:45
literally says the cherubim in heaven
07:47
people say
07:48
many different ways uh actually the
07:50
cherubim are very different creatures in
07:52
heaven
07:53
they are part of the angelic tribe a
07:56
chair of
07:57
most people shows a little fat baby
07:59
angel i have never seen any in heaven
08:01
i'm not saying they aren't there
08:03
i've just never seen a little fat baby
08:05
angel naked
08:06
no not that either and uh but a cherubim
08:11
is fantastic they have eyes and all
08:13
their wings
08:15
they're very uh powerful beings and
08:17
intelligent beings in heaven
08:20
and like the living creatures it talks
08:22
about in revelation
08:23
4. why don't you all go read revelation
08:25
4.
08:26
guess what you get a lot of revelation
08:28
about heaven itself that's when john
08:30
was caught up into the heavens and he
08:34
was in heaven itself and saw many things
08:36
he actually saw the cherubim
08:38
in heaven around the throne that had
08:41
many eyes and their bodies and their
08:43
wings
08:44
but a cheer up like people i'm sure and
08:46
all the valentine cars people
08:48
i've probably been buying there's
08:49
probably little baby cherubs holding a
08:51
heart or something like that
08:53
but but normally that's probably just
08:56
in heaven if you said cherub that would
08:59
be
09:00
short for cherubim that would be an
09:03
abbreviation for true of them
09:05
who are anything but little fat baby
09:06
angels
09:08
so there you go that's all i'm going to
09:09
give you today about the cherub
09:12
they're part of the angelic tribe there
09:14
you go
09:16
and i'm waiting on the next question
09:18
next question
09:20
okay this one's like a long list but i'm
09:24
not going to read all of them
09:25
i think we need a drum roll for this
09:26
yeah
09:28
this is one person's one person
09:31
now we love it when you send and ask us
09:33
a question but it's
09:34
kind of hard when you ask 50 or if
09:38
you send five paragraphs to ask your
09:41
question
09:42
um it's just go to the heart of it and
09:45
let's hear what okay
09:46
so this is from paulette in new york hi
09:49
paula from new york and she she sent
09:52
seven questions but i'm only gonna do
09:54
i'm only gonna do one pick one right now
09:57
and maybe the other ones will show up on
09:59
a
09:59
podcast or something okay okay um
10:05
i had it picked out where is it
10:10
okay here we go
10:14
where did the other races of
10:18
people come from which that's a bible
10:21
story
10:22
so i guess she's wanting to know
10:24
paulette wants to know where did all the
10:26
other races of the people come from
10:28
i assume she definitely means on earth
10:31
right so you need to make sure you say
10:32
earth or heaven where did the other race
10:35
because there's races of people who died
10:37
and moved to heaven too so
10:38
for me i need a little bit a little bit
10:40
detail so where did the other races come
10:43
from
10:43
on the earth well at one point there
10:46
weren't
10:47
races they didn't they weren't even
10:48
divided into races
10:50
they just had people on the earth and
10:52
everyone spoke the same language and
10:54
everyone spoke the same language which
10:56
was kind of wild if you can imagine so
10:58
everyone who'd been
11:00
born on the earth at one point there was
11:03
a point
11:04
on the earth when everyone spoke the
11:05
same language but we don't do that now
11:07
and the bible does talk about the tower
11:10
of babel
11:11
which did happen it was something that
11:13
it happened where god
11:14
uh decided to separate
11:18
the races and give them different
11:20
languages
11:21
and you can imagine when that did happen
11:24
that some people
11:25
after they could understand everybody
11:26
for so long and back then people lived a
11:29
very long time
11:30
and you know i know there were some
11:32
people who lived actually to be 700
11:33
years old
11:34
i think enoch was only 300 that was like
11:37
young
11:38
back then so back in this time when for
11:41
for years and years and generations had
11:43
gone by everybody understood everybody
11:45
and yet in the moment of a day there
11:48
came a time when
11:49
a lot of people didn't understand
11:50
everyone else and only certain groups of
11:52
people
11:53
i'm sure he chose whole families and
11:56
relations to those families
11:58
gave them a different language and that
12:01
caused those people to separate
12:03
create their own groups of people and
12:05
maybe even move where they could all be
12:07
together so they could understand each
12:09
other
12:10
all the people on the earth according to
12:12
the bible
12:14
adam was the very first one and it talks
12:17
about adam being the first
12:18
man on the earth adam and then of course
12:21
he created eve
12:22
they were the first ones he put them in
12:24
the garden of eden a lot of people know
12:26
that part
12:27
and then of course they had sons and
12:29
then the population began to build
12:31
but there came a point and it was at the
12:34
time of
12:35
noah that this happened this certain
12:37
thing happened
12:38
that that was when he got wiped out the
12:40
earth because the people were so wicked
12:42
so evil can you imagine
12:44
that there are probably hundreds of
12:45
thousands of people on the earth that
12:47
they were so
12:48
evil and wicked that he only
12:51
kept noah and his immediate family
12:54
and they were kept on the ark and the
12:57
bible says
12:59
from the time of noah onward
13:02
everyone on the earth came from the
13:05
lineage of
13:05
noah so i can say what i know
13:08
as far as what the scriptures say that
13:11
from the time of noah
13:13
everyone on this earth is related to him
13:17
because of course everybody else was
13:18
taken off the earth and people newly
13:20
born on the earth
13:22
all came from the lineage of noah so i
13:24
can just say that
13:25
and there was a time when the groups of
13:27
people were separated by god given
13:29
different languages
13:30
so we'll just go with that for right now
13:33
uh there is some things i may as well
13:36
just add this to cause discussions
13:37
between
13:38
between all of you there what there are
13:41
some
13:42
theories that people believe after adam
13:46
and eve
13:46
god kept creating people now i don't
13:50
know
13:50
and if you find it in the word maybe you
13:52
could inform
13:54
us in the comments i can't find it in
13:56
the world where it says
13:57
every single human being came from adam
14:00
and eve
14:02
because the the race was all destroyed
14:05
but at one point
14:06
when noah was saved the word does say
14:09
that from the time of noah everyone else
14:12
on the earth was related
14:14
from the lineage of noah so there is
14:17
this possibility that people talk about
14:19
all the time
14:20
that god could have made adam and eve he
14:22
could have made other people on the
14:24
earth because he was really trying to
14:25
accelerate
14:26
populating the earth and there's always
14:28
questions like well
14:30
who did adam and eve's sons mary who did
14:32
they married was it their sisters
14:34
was it someone else where did other
14:35
people come from i think we will all
14:38
probably
14:38
wait until we get to heaven to get that
14:41
question
14:42
answered so there you go next question
14:44
okay this is actually from
14:46
facebook um this is specifically
14:49
for you and um they must be
14:52
maybe new people that haven't heard
14:54
stuff from them okay yeah there's always
14:56
new people you need to consider that i'm
14:57
going to add this for free
14:59
there are people who find me and that's
15:02
what they say it's very funny
15:03
i found you on youtube i found you on
15:07
facebook or i
15:08
met you on youtube or i met you on
15:10
facebook i met you on twitter i met you
15:12
on the podcast for the first time
15:14
and now we have instagram and now we
15:16
have instagram hey
15:17
so we're really expanding out there and
15:20
so
15:20
every day throughout the day there are
15:23
new people discovering
15:25
me so they don't know a lot of the
15:27
revelation those of you who have been
15:29
watching and listening for 10 years you
15:31
know a lot but you still have to
15:33
consider here's some new person
15:35
who's watching maybe just found me by
15:37
accident like oh my gosh
15:39
look at that person she's got pink hair
15:41
but she's talking about god
15:43
okay so what is the question well it's
15:45
from jonathan
15:47
and patricia and it says do you leave
15:51
your body
15:52
when you visit heaven oh that is a very
15:55
good question
15:56
jonathan and patricia jonathan and
15:59
patricia
16:00
welcome to our q a session and that is a
16:03
wonderful
16:04
that's a wonderful question they want to
16:06
know that when i
16:08
am caught up to heaven do i leave my
16:10
body
16:11
because some people think where does
16:12
your body go does your spirit man go
16:15
and that'll give me an opportunity to
16:17
answer a couple other things to make it
16:19
clear
16:20
i don't go in my body my physical body
16:23
stays here
16:24
on the earth my family all know that
16:26
because if they come in my room or if
16:28
i'm sitting in my desk or something else
16:30
if they come up and speak to me and
16:32
there's no response
16:35
at all i'm just like staring saying
16:37
nothing
16:38
they know that my spirit man is in
16:40
heaven so i am caught up
16:42
by my spirit and i am taken to heaven i
16:45
don't make myself go
16:47
okay god's never done that with me he's
16:50
always just caught me up
16:51
either by the spirit of god sometimes
16:53
jesus comes and just catches me
16:55
by my spirit when i'm in heaven i don't
16:57
look down and see my body i don't look
16:59
down
17:00
i am focused on what they want to show
17:02
me in heaven and yes this has been going
17:04
on for a
17:05
long time for a very long time
17:09
since early 90s i've been caught up i
17:12
had got off to heaven
17:13
taken on tours of heaven for the purpose
17:16
of revealing to the earth what heaven is
17:18
like how heaven operates what the people
17:20
look like what their mansions look like
17:23
places that are made in heaven things
17:25
you get to do there
17:26
what about your family members all kinds
17:28
of things god has me reveal and i
17:30
actually have a commission i he came to
17:34
jesus came to me
17:35
in person face to face and said the
17:38
father and i are going to start taking
17:40
you on tours of heaven and guess what i
17:42
didn't say no
17:43
so it is my spiritual body and this is
17:45
why it's wonderful
17:47
i know for sure jesse duplantis
17:50
go check him out jesse duplantis he
17:53
lives in
17:54
new orleans or right outside new orleans
17:56
louisiana
17:57
he literally was caught up in his
18:00
physical body
18:01
and taken to heaven if you if that
18:03
happens to you
18:05
you will know now i know that you know
18:08
paul didn't know but a lot of people at
18:11
that time probably hadn't been caught up
18:12
to heaven
18:13
if you're caught up in your physical
18:14
body your physical body is not
18:16
accustomed to the glory
18:18
the power and the life of god that is in
18:20
heaven and eventually
18:22
your physical body would get weak in
18:25
heaven
18:26
however your spiritual body that is is
18:29
all spirit it's made out of light heaven
18:32
itself
18:33
is made out of light it's a building
18:34
substance so everywhere you go in heaven
18:37
in your spiritual body
18:38
you can touch the ground you actually
18:40
sit in your mansion
18:41
i have guests in your mansion you travel
18:44
all over heaven
18:45
you know on light or sound you enjoy a
18:48
literal
18:49
life and that's the proper way to say it
18:51
so every time i go to heaven i
18:52
experience
18:53
everything that is there but it is my
18:55
spiritual body and when god is done
18:58
he sends he brings my my spiritual body
19:01
back
19:02
zip right inside my body and then i'm
19:04
aware of everything i have every memory
19:06
of being there
19:06
the smells the emotions the things i
19:10
saw it's all retained because
19:13
your spirit man has a mind
19:16
okay your soul which is in your spirit
19:19
man
19:19
is what you express emotions from it's
19:21
what you gather information with
19:23
so your spirit man and your soul i was
19:26
caught up to heaven i have both of those
19:28
my physical body just sits and does
19:30
nothing
19:31
so there you go here's the answer all
19:33
right
19:34
next question is from bonnie
19:37
and it says do people who accept christ
19:40
on their death bed have big elaborate
19:44
mansions do people on their deathbed
19:48
have big elaborate mansions in heaven
19:51
that's really um more than one question
19:54
but i'll go ahead and
19:55
answer that question the bible clearly
19:58
says that god will reward us for our
20:00
lives
20:01
lived on the earth you're not going to
20:03
escape being rewarded by god
20:06
now what some people think of as a
20:08
reward
20:09
may not be the the powerful
20:12
supernatural reward that we get in
20:14
heaven
20:15
and the thing that he loves the most is
20:18
if you used
20:19
the gift he put in you like whitney
20:22
houston
20:23
she used her gift she sang she used it
20:26
all the time
20:27
it blessed god she got she gave herself
20:31
back to christ the night before she died
20:35
and let me tell you what she had
20:37
fantastic reward in heaven i didn't see
20:39
her mansion
20:40
but i was actually caught up to heaven
20:42
and i saw her receiving rewards from the
20:44
father at the throne
20:46
this was right after she had passed and
20:49
you know what this is the other thing
20:51
whether you have a massive mansion
20:53
because you really
20:54
gave your entire life every hour of the
20:57
day
20:57
you helped people loved people you use
21:00
the gift he put in you
21:02
you ran your race holy on purpose
21:05
they're going to have fantastic mansions
21:07
because they gave
21:09
more of their self now you cannot work
21:12
for your salvation
21:13
i have to say that that salvation is
21:16
free
21:17
and there is no one in heaven that is
21:19
sad
21:20
disappointed or upset so no matter what
21:23
they
21:23
ended up with to live in they were
21:26
filled with joy
21:27
with celebration with excitement because
21:31
of what god had made for them
21:33
but god is a just god and those who
21:36
really
21:37
served him loved him and loved others
21:40
and was forgiving all the time and
21:43
didn't live with the fence in them
21:45
of course their mansion is going to be
21:47
fantastic i have
21:49
seen mansions in heaven that were the
21:52
size of
21:53
new york city i hope that stretches your
21:56
mind
21:57
on realizing how huge heaven is
22:00
it's fantastic it is amazing there are
22:03
sky mansions mansions under the crystal
22:05
sea
22:06
there's an amazon forest and amazing i
22:08
just say amazon to give you an idea
22:11
uh there's like massive trees that would
22:14
be the size of 12 massive trees here
22:16
they're like 500 feet high there's
22:18
wonderful beautiful things there
22:21
so there's there's like forest there's
22:23
the mountain of spices
22:24
there's passionate paradise that's about
22:26
the love of christ
22:28
and worshiping him so many places in
22:30
heaven with many different mansions
22:32
i've never seen a shack
22:36
or just a little cabin if someone had a
22:38
cabin it was on the property of their
22:41
amazing mansion and family members do
22:44
live right next door each other but when
22:47
you come home to heaven you don't come
22:49
as somebody's husband or wife
22:51
you come home to heaven as the father
22:53
son
22:54
or daughter and he makes sure everybody
22:56
gets a mansion
22:57
so absolutely i've seen such amazing
23:01
beautiful mansions
23:02
and they were the mansions of little
23:04
grandma intercessors that prayed in
23:06
their closet
23:08
and prayed in three or four moves of god
23:11
forgave anyone who came against them
23:13
just poured out their life
23:15
all day for god and even though no one
23:18
on the earth knew them
23:20
god was quite aware of what they were
23:23
doing for him and he rewarded them
23:25
powerfully
23:26
but everyone in heaven celebrates the
23:29
fact that they're
23:30
there so next question okay next
23:33
question
23:34
is okay and i'm only going to mention
23:38
this because
23:40
this is like a major topic with a lot of
23:42
things
23:43
and a lot of people have said if you
23:45
don't do this specific thing
23:47
you won't go to heaven oh this is a good
23:49
one yes
23:51
and if and i know what you're going to
23:53
say
23:54
so of course you do you're my sister
23:57
and i've known you since you were a baby
23:59
but i love sharing this too because it
24:01
debunks
24:02
so much stuff of why you get sent in we
24:05
are
24:05
myth busters today yes and it's
24:09
important to do that so people
24:10
know the truth it says the truth will
24:12
make you free
24:14
and we are definitely filled with truth
24:16
and revelation from the father so
24:18
we're going to do it right now this is
24:20
from anna
24:22
and she would like to know do you
24:25
have to be water baptized in order to
24:29
well she didn't say in order to go to
24:31
heaven but oh
24:32
okay but it's necessary to be water
24:35
baptized
24:36
okay but you can expound on that foreign
24:40
if you don't get baptized you won't go
24:42
to heaven if you don't tithe you better
24:45
you know if you don't go to church yes
24:47
there's many things
24:49
um over time that has been developed in
24:52
the mind of
24:53
man and man and if you do not
24:57
many times have revelation from god
25:01
or the scriptures aren't open to you or
25:04
let's just say you never read the bible
25:06
you need to read the bible the true word
25:09
of god okay and people go what
25:12
translations do you read i'm just this
25:14
is a free
25:15
tip from catker i love
25:18
the amplified bible i read that's on my
25:21
desk i have the king james version
25:24
because it has a lot of stuff that is
25:26
truth in revelation that's not even put
25:28
in other translations
25:30
i i love the amplified i love the
25:32
everyday bible that's an older bible
25:35
i absolutely love my main reading
25:39
bible is the scofield bible because of
25:41
all of the comments
25:43
the commentaries that are put in there
25:45
the revelation that god gave that mr
25:47
scofield
25:49
that that really explain and expound
25:52
with revelation on the word of god so i
25:55
would definitely say
25:56
the niv the king james the amplified
26:00
the everyday bible i'm trying to think
26:03
of some other
26:04
versions of it some my my husband likes
26:07
to read
26:08
the one that's more like everyday
26:11
language it might be well it's not the
26:14
enemy if he was here would ask him but
26:16
i'll find out let people know later
26:18
because they're always asking me which
26:19
ones are okay
26:20
there are newer translations however
26:25
that leave out some of the word of god
26:28
some aren't even a complete
26:29
bible i'm not talking about just the new
26:31
testament it's great if you start with
26:33
the new testament
26:34
i also love the not just the historical
26:37
part of the
26:38
the old testament but the miraculous
26:40
that happened
26:41
hey people the parting of the red sea
26:44
all of that is real when elijah was on
26:46
mount carmel okay
26:48
those powerful things that happened way
26:51
back
26:52
in those days are exciting to read when
26:54
you see even god's hand move back then
26:56
the new testament of course is about
26:58
jesus christ what he did for us
27:00
the acts of the apostles did you know
27:02
that's what the book of acts was about
27:04
is what they did operating in the word
27:06
of god the power of god that jesus
27:08
christ gave them
27:09
when he raised up these apostles under
27:11
him but there are some newer
27:13
translations there's
27:14
every kind of bible out there trust me
27:16
even ones that are not good
27:19
okay that you don't want to read and by
27:21
the way this is for free also free tip
27:24
do not read false religions
27:28
words like their bibles like
27:31
it's not wise to fill yourself with the
27:33
quran
27:34
it's not wise to read the book of mormon
27:37
it is not
27:38
wise at all to read the satanic bible
27:40
none of these things are about false
27:42
religions that do not believe in jesus
27:45
christ his blood that he is the son of
27:47
god
27:48
or they leave out main events that are
27:50
going to happen
27:52
there will be a tribulation i've seen
27:54
the timeline of god that's embedded in
27:56
the floor
27:57
behind his throne and these things are
28:00
going to happen
28:00
the millennial reign of christ which you
28:02
could also say the thousand-year
28:04
reign of jesus christ on this earth it
28:07
will happen by the way that's
28:08
quite a ways away from here i've been
28:11
taking over 100 years into the future
28:13
we're still here so that's also a free
28:16
tip
28:16
you're not going to be you're not going
28:17
to be raptured out of here in the next
28:19
few days or the next few years
28:21
it's not going to happen in 10 20 30 40
28:24
50 60 i just could gone
28:26
it's going to happen when the father
28:27
decides what will happen but if you get
28:29
a bible
28:30
and it does not include major
28:33
acts of god or events that god has
28:35
already
28:36
ordained will happen he needs these
28:39
events to happen
28:40
for his purposes
28:44
don't read a bible that leaves major
28:47
things
28:48
out especially accountability especially
28:51
where it talks about sin make sure that
28:53
you repent of your sins
28:55
there's all kinds of stuff going on and
28:57
it's all kind of teachings
28:58
literally in some churches they teach
29:01
that you don't need jesus christ to go
29:02
to heaven
29:03
or that everyone's going to heaven no
29:05
matter what they've done
29:06
or the whole world's going to heaven i
29:08
promise you the whole world's not going
29:10
to heaven
29:11
but you give yourself to jesus christ
29:13
you find a word of god
29:15
that is supposed to be like a plum line
29:17
of decisions that you make
29:19
sometimes it will help you learn how to
29:21
pray how to develop an intimate
29:23
relationship with jesus christ so i'm
29:25
glad this question was asked
29:27
so there are many different translations
29:29
of what people
29:30
call the bible and if they're not a
29:32
whole word of god the whole new
29:34
testament or the whole
29:36
of you know the old testament or just
29:38
both of them together that's not a truth
29:41
that's not all the truth
29:43
you find a word and you find the church
29:44
that teaches the whole truth
29:47
you can't leave the holy spirit out of
29:48
your life he's the third member of the
29:50
trinity he is god
29:51
also so i can tell you right now
29:54
the bibles i read have the whole council
29:57
of god in them
29:59
and i've talked so long i forgot what
30:02
the original question was
30:06
is it necessary to be water baptized
30:09
and i didn't even answer that question
30:11
and he just went out but that's okay
30:14
i would have wheeled you back in when
30:15
you were so worried
30:19
you know why the word of god by the way
30:24
it talks about being water baptized yes
30:26
it's in the bible
30:28
you give yourself to jesus christ repent
30:30
of your sins
30:31
okay because you're not going to heaven
30:33
if you don't repent and i'll tell you
30:35
why
30:36
the father told me he's not letting evil
30:38
wickedness and sin
30:39
into heaven that's his home he said if i
30:42
let everyone come to heaven without
30:44
receiving my son
30:46
heaven would be just like the earth
30:50
and you don't want to live in eternity
30:53
in the earth right you're going to live
30:55
in heaven
30:56
and i need to i need a break just a
30:58
minute
31:02
okay
31:05
it is necessary to be water baptized
31:07
because that
31:09
is an outward representation
31:12
that you gave yourself to jesus christ
31:14
and when you do that it's like you
31:17
died with him that's what it is when you
31:19
get when he
31:20
he he wipes away all of your sin and
31:23
fills you with him
31:25
okay water baptism is an outward
31:28
expression that you received
31:29
christ and your sins were wiped away so
31:33
it's like you died and were resurrected
31:36
with him
31:36
in him and now he lives in you and
31:39
that's what water baptism is that's why
31:41
it is important to have it done however
31:44
it's not going to keep you from going to
31:46
heaven okay
31:47
if you don't receive holy spirit of
31:49
course that is such a power
31:50
living in you he will become your best
31:53
friend he
31:54
is my best friend holy spirit is and and
31:57
he tweaks me all the time he makes me
31:59
laugh he shows me things to come he
32:01
opens up the word of god
32:03
how do you get him the same way you get
32:04
christ you receive christ first and then
32:06
you invite holy spirit to indwell
32:08
you and let me tell you he's not going
32:11
to say no
32:12
so these are all a necessary process
32:15
because when you get saved it's
32:17
wonderful the salvation is free
32:20
you have grace for eternal life your
32:22
name is written in the lamb's book of
32:24
life
32:24
but it's important to do these other
32:26
things because they increase your
32:28
intimacy with christ
32:29
they open up the knowledge and the
32:31
understanding of god himself
32:33
so water baptism is showing and let me
32:35
tell you
32:36
you don't have to do it in church a lot
32:39
of churches have a baptismal they'll be
32:41
glad to do that for you
32:42
but i know people who've gotten baptized
32:45
in horse troughs and swimming pools
32:48
yeah one of my own dollars was baptized
32:49
in the swimming pool
32:52
at this private school that allowed
32:53
everyone to come they had ceremonies and
32:55
they did that
32:56
they just baptized you in water and let
32:59
me tell you
33:00
the most important thing it says if you
33:01
believe on jesus christ you shall be
33:04
saved
33:04
but being water baptized being filled
33:06
with the holy spirit
33:08
finding a good truth speaking
33:11
church because it says to not forsake
33:15
the gathering together of yourselves
33:17
that means you can be part of a prayer
33:19
group that means that someone who has a
33:21
home church you can attend that
33:23
some people watch church online and they
33:26
give and tithe into that place
33:28
wherever you are fed whatever
33:31
feeds you in the word of god if there's
33:33
somebody who does that whether it's a
33:35
church a prayer group
33:37
it could be a school of the spirit go
33:40
where you can get more of god so it's
33:42
not absolutely necessary
33:44
because i will go back to the same thing
33:47
that jesus said to the thief
33:49
on the cross yay the thief on the cross
33:51
the thief on the cross
33:53
recognized that jesus christ was the son
33:56
of god
33:57
and he received him by the words he
34:00
spoke to jesus himself
34:02
remember me when you come into your
34:05
kingdom remember me
34:07
because he knew who he was but the other
34:09
thief rejected him
34:11
guess where that thief went okay this
34:13
thief on the cross
34:14
received jesus christ and christ
34:17
answered him and said
34:19
today you shall be with me
34:22
in paradise now at that time
34:25
when people who were accounted just and
34:29
righteous because they
34:30
they recognized god and received him
34:34
then god kept them in a place in the
34:36
earth called paradise it was down here
34:38
it was a spiritual place a beautiful
34:40
place
34:40
so when abraham isaac jacob when all
34:43
those great
34:44
men women you know esther ruth when they
34:48
passed they descended into paradise or
34:51
abraham's bosom
34:52
and it was not hell it was not hell
34:56
that was for the wicked dead so i can
34:59
tell you
34:59
that because the thief on the cross he
35:02
went
35:03
and when and later on in that day this
35:05
is when they're hanging on the cross
35:06
this happened all right
35:08
uh when they when the thieves died
35:11
when they both died the one who rejected
35:14
christ
35:14
went into hell the other thief was
35:17
in paradise when abraham's bosom which
35:19
you know according to the word
35:21
when christ's spirit man left the cross
35:23
he descended into paradise
35:26
or abraham's bosom he preached the
35:28
gospel to
35:29
all of them because according to them
35:32
they their messiah had not come yet so
35:34
you're getting a lot of scripture right
35:35
now it's important to know this though
35:37
so abraham isaac david all those
35:39
righteous men
35:40
um that would also be joseph you know
35:42
the one who raised jesus
35:44
these people before christ died on the
35:47
cross
35:49
ascended after he wiped up hell
35:52
according to colossians he wiped up hell
35:55
on the third day he spoiled and ruined
35:57
prince valors and powers melted them
35:59
okay and he took the keys of hell death
36:01
and the grave from
36:02
lucifer and then at that point christ
36:05
rose up got his body back his physical
36:08
body
36:08
back so if you want to know is your
36:10
spirit man busy
36:12
can it see and hear and touch and feel
36:14
christ did all those things
36:15
in his spirit man descended into
36:18
abraham's bosom
36:19
saw the thief welcomed him greeted him
36:22
like he said he would
36:23
and then preach the gospel to all those
36:25
who were there
36:27
they were held captive in that place
36:29
because
36:30
heaven had to be chris had to pearl his
36:34
blood on the altar in heaven
36:36
and everyone sins from that point when
36:39
they repented
36:40
and you got forgiveness when you died
36:42
from that point you just
36:44
you ascended into heaven and abraham's
36:46
bosom was cleaned out
36:48
he led captivity captive and they all
36:50
went up to heaven
36:51
with christ so that changed everything
36:53
that's why it was necessary
36:55
so christ to do that so does that
36:57
because this is another
36:58
kind of you you answered someone's
37:00
question i was going to ask
37:02
okay but they just asked a further
37:03
question um
37:06
about paradise yeah so is it uh
37:10
is it temporary or is it no longer
37:12
existing
37:14
paradise was like i said it was another
37:16
word and it was called
37:17
both places in the bible called it said
37:19
abraham is
37:20
more paradise it was the place where the
37:23
those who were counted
37:24
just and righteous by god because they
37:27
believed
37:28
in him and this is before christ came to
37:31
the earth and died for us
37:32
it was a place that was created so they
37:35
had a place to stay and live
37:37
there was buildings there was a river
37:39
i've seen that place
37:40
a beautiful place that god kept his that
37:43
he counted as just and righteous
37:45
it was emptied out when christ went
37:48
there when his spiritual body left the
37:50
cross and he went into abraham's bosom
37:52
met actually he met in person abraham
37:55
isaac jacob king david
37:57
solomon adam was there the only ones not
38:01
there were elijah and nina
38:02
they actually were taken to heaven
38:04
itself by
38:05
by god the father he caught them up and
38:07
took them in their physical bodies
38:10
so they they were the only ones up in
38:12
heaven besides all of the angels the
38:14
living creatures
38:15
um god you know the father or son holy
38:18
spirit they all lived in heaven
38:19
but after that happened it says
38:23
in the word that people no longer
38:25
descended
38:27
they ascended christ descended for us
38:30
and he cleaned that place out by
38:32
preaching the gospel to them
38:33
not hell okay he didn't go there to
38:36
preach the gospel
38:37
and then after he preached the gospel
38:39
then he went over to hell
38:40
christ did and then he was there and it
38:43
says in the bible for three days he was
38:45
there
38:46
and then of course we know what happened
38:48
on the third day and then christ
38:49
after he was done wiping up hell taking
38:51
the keys he went back up to the tomb got
38:54
his
38:54
physical body it was glorified instantly
38:58
which is what we will experience on the
39:00
day that dead and christ will rise
39:02
our spirit men our spirit bodies have
39:04
been living in heaven that's us
39:06
will be rejoined with our physical body
39:08
it will be glorified that means you can
39:10
never sin
39:11
never fall never die never get sick that
39:14
you will be immortal it says mortality
39:16
will take on immortality
39:18
that's us we're mortals now we may be
39:21
supernatural morals
39:23
but to come a time in your life because
39:25
of your receiving of jesus christ that
39:27
you will be immortal
39:29
and that's scriptural so there you go
39:33
so it's empty abraham's bosom paradise
39:35
is empty now there's no one
39:36
yeah because when you die whoever owns
39:38
you oh comes and gets you comes together
39:41
and that's the best way the father said
39:43
to me the first time i've
39:44
got to heaven when you die whoever owns
39:46
you will come for you
39:48
so make sure you are praying for all of
39:50
your loved ones who don't know christ
39:53
because god gives us promises in the
39:55
word and it says because we are
39:57
believers who have received christ and
39:59
bleed christ
40:01
that there are things we can ask him if
40:02
we don't doubt in our heart but believe
40:05
what we say will come to pass
40:07
then we will have whatsoever we say and
40:09
the greatest thing you can do with that
40:10
scripture is stand
40:11
and say i stand for the salvation of my
40:14
family members for all those who don't
40:15
know christ i declare
40:17
they will know him love and receive him
40:19
and that we will be together
40:21
for eternity that is a powerful
40:23
declaration
40:24
but once you've prayed that for them
40:26
don't talk about how bad they are
40:28
okay you don't want to do that that's
40:30
like being double-minded if you're
40:31
declaring they're going to know christ
40:33
pray for them
40:33
love them you may not be able to
40:35
validate what they're doing don't
40:36
validate their sin
40:38
okay every time you see them love them
40:41
and just tell them god loves them
40:43
keep praying for them but it's a
40:44
powerful prayer for a believer to stand
40:46
for their family members because it says
40:48
you
40:48
and your household shall be saved
40:52
and so that's because you know christ
40:55
but uh so that answers that question
40:57
very good um let's take a
40:59
quick break oh yeah we want to uh tell
41:02
everybody what we're going to show them
41:03
yes we're going to take a little break
41:05
and let you know we have some new things
41:08
that we are going to we've been doing
41:10
actually
41:10
and one of them is called cat on the go
41:13
and you become a part of my life where
41:15
i'm going what i'm doing
41:16
and we stop and make a little mini video
41:18
and share that little piece of life so
41:20
we're going to take a moment and let you
41:22
see
41:22
one right now hi everybody this is pat
41:25
on the go and here i am
41:28
say hi welcome hey everybody yeah we're
41:31
very busy so we won't be talking to you
41:33
very long but
41:34
we're here discussing illustrations of
41:37
the things that will become images
41:39
in the resurrection movie is that right
41:42
right it's exciting isn't it to be a
41:44
part of it but
41:46
it is a lot of work trust me it takes
41:48
hours to do this
41:50
you know we have to make sketches and he
41:52
takes it makes it look amazingly
41:53
beautiful
41:54
okay i don't do that part he does and
41:56
then we come back and there's edits and
41:58
then he has to change things and i
42:00
change things and he changes things
42:02
but it's going to be amazing when it's
42:03
all done and we can't
42:06
we cannot we cannot wait to you know
42:09
take that throne
42:10
that throne that satan's been sitting on
42:12
hollywood he's going down
42:14
people going down god is taking it
42:17
and we are doing this back again i hope
42:20
you enjoyed that
42:21
and so we did these cat on the gos
42:23
different at different times on
42:24
different days but
42:25
you will enjoy every one of them so what
42:28
is the next question
42:29
um well this one's a bit of a
42:33
tough subject and i the question
42:37
flew by really fast so i didn't catch
42:38
who asked it but
42:40
um someone uh i think it was their
42:43
nephew
42:44
or something has recently committed
42:46
suicide
42:47
and they feel they're in heaven and
42:50
um i didn't get to like i said i didn't
42:52
get to read all of the question but
42:54
what is god's say about that
42:57
yes what does god say about when someone
42:59
commits suicide
43:01
so that is a very interesting question
43:04
for me
43:04
exciting but now you go that's just
43:06
weird this is exciting
43:08
not when god has caught you up on
43:11
purpose to give you revelation yes
43:13
and i have revelation on suicide
43:17
i never knew my whole life now there
43:19
were really strong christians
43:21
i knew growing up and then later in life
43:23
and they were going through a horrific
43:25
struggles
43:26
and they they ended their life
43:30
and i inside knew that they were in
43:33
heaven some of them i saw later in
43:34
heaven
43:35
and so the father on purpose said i'm
43:38
going to show you the truth
43:40
about suicide and he said first before i
43:43
catch you up you're going to go to
43:44
webster's dictionary and look up
43:46
what it says about suicide and i was
43:49
quite surprised because we all know
43:52
people who do that what
43:54
they call suicide what is called suicide
43:56
people are either
43:57
under horrific stress
44:01
or trauma and it can be physical
44:03
emotional or
44:04
mental there's three areas in life where
44:08
the
44:08
enemy will just bombard you and crush
44:10
you
44:11
until you no longer can stand it and
44:13
then people
44:14
in their life take their life and
44:16
everyone tags it
44:18
suicide but god doesn't do that
44:21
god is just and righteous so when i
44:23
looked up the word suicide in the
44:25
webster's dictionary it said
44:28
someone who commits suicide is in their
44:31
right mind
44:32
with all of their senses they are
44:39
knowledge of their mind their will and
44:41
their emotions they know exactly what
44:43
they're doing
44:44
they're not in trauma or stress and they
44:47
take their life
44:51
and god said to me that would be like a
44:54
terrorist
44:54
or a suicide bomber there are people who
44:57
plan
44:58
on purpose in their right mind to on
45:01
purpose
45:02
die and most of the time our last time
45:04
that is to hurt other people
45:06
yeah like let's say um 9 11.
45:10
okay all those people who are involved
45:12
with the
45:13
the death of all those people when those
45:16
planes
45:17
hit the buildings they knew their life
45:20
would be taken that was suicide these
45:23
people
45:23
willingly knowingly got on those planes
45:26
to on purpose go kill
45:28
people and end many people's lives and
45:30
that is called suicide
45:32
what people this is the father speaking
45:34
to me what people are experiencing
45:36
they're not ending their life they
45:40
can't bear the pain they're in whether
45:42
it's mental
45:43
emotional or physical sometimes people
45:45
are in accidents
45:46
the pain has agony the medicines
45:49
sometimes the medicines
45:51
even will give you thoughts of suicide
45:54
and some people just
45:55
can't no longer handle the suffering and
45:58
god said they don't want to take their
46:00
life or end their life
46:01
they're ending their suffering and he
46:04
said to me
46:05
i would be unjust especially if this
46:08
person had received my son
46:10
and they couldn't handle the suffering
46:12
they were ending the suffering he said
46:14
i do not send those people to hell and i
46:16
do not call that suicide
46:19
and so therefore that is a very
46:21
important answer
46:23
and the first time i released that
46:25
people were in shock
46:26
but it makes sense because if somebody
46:28
knew christ
46:30
but then some tragedy happened to them
46:32
whether physical mental or emotional
46:35
that wasn't even their fault and they
46:37
couldn't bear the suffering so they all
46:39
they want to do is go home to heaven
46:40
this does not give you excuse because
46:42
you're going through a hard time
46:44
to to take your life to go to heaven
46:46
that's not right
46:47
but people who are in agony
46:50
on strong medications going through
46:53
trauma's therapy
46:54
you know when they get to the point
46:56
where they cannot handle
46:58
living they end their suffering and
47:01
after he taught me that he took me to
47:03
heaven and showed me three different
47:05
people
47:06
and i think it's even in one of my books
47:08
where he talks about
47:10
this whole thing about ending your
47:12
suffering
47:13
or taking your life there's a difference
47:15
so you know
47:16
a terrorist suicide person someone like
47:19
that
47:19
that is suicide but someone who's ending
47:22
their suffering
47:23
because of the trauma even some children
47:25
do it teenagers
47:26
older people people every age suffer but
47:29
this
47:30
is the good news if
47:33
at any time when they were still in the
47:35
right mind if you can get them to choose
47:37
to
47:38
lose i was just going to say i will tell
47:40
you god
47:41
was so adamant about this that he told
47:44
me
47:44
i'm going to put despair on you for a
47:47
week
47:48
and you will not be able to bear it and
47:50
people go why would he do that so i
47:52
would totally understand
47:54
what people are feeling when they get to
47:56
that point
47:57
and he said right before suicide there
48:00
is despair
48:01
despair when you get into despair
48:03
there's no hope no way out it's
48:06
absolute agony in your mind to even
48:08
exist
48:09
and he said i'm going to put i'll let
48:10
you experience it and he he
48:12
literally put despair on me and for a
48:14
week i would go climb in my car this was
48:17
years and years ago he did this and i
48:19
would all i would do is cry out to him
48:22
i couldn't bear it i let me tell you i
48:24
couldn't think right
48:26
my emotions were a mess physically i had
48:30
no energy i couldn't even think of a way
48:32
out
48:33
but i knew in my mind this was something
48:35
god was letting me experience i think
48:37
it's the only way
48:38
i actually survived it at the end of the
48:41
seven days he just came and took it off
48:44
and joy and celebration flooded myself
48:47
he said i don't want you to ever forget
48:50
that is what people experience when they
48:52
go through oppression
48:54
depression deep depression then there is
48:57
a spirit of depression on people
48:59
and then there's despair after despair
49:02
gets in then that's when the suicidal
49:05
thoughts start coming
49:07
people need to not keep that in them
49:10
that's why he tells me
49:12
god says don't even let sadness be in
49:14
you do not let sadness
49:16
rule your life most of the time you
49:18
don't even know why you're sad you need
49:19
to say i
49:20
choose as an act of my will to lose all
49:22
sadness
49:23
all oppression all depression
49:26
[Music]
49:27
all despair and for some people you need
49:30
to say this i lose
49:31
every suicidal thought from me i will
49:33
not keep it in my soul
49:36
and then you say and i choose with my
49:38
will to bind the life of god
49:41
the love of god the presence of god
49:45
his joy his celebration
49:48
those i bind to my soul and no one can
49:51
take them from you i hope
49:53
this really helps somebody today but it
49:56
does give
49:56
hope for all those if your family member
49:59
was in agony in the end of their
50:01
suffering
50:03
i promise you and especially if you made
50:05
a stand for them to know christ
50:07
they will be in heaven this is the hope
50:10
we have and a promise we have
50:12
from jesus christ and people tell me
50:16
sometimes you don't talk about jesus he
50:18
is my everything
50:20
he is my number one my husband
50:24
is my number two and that's not ever
50:27
going to be changed
50:29
don't run out in the spirit and become
50:32
so supernatural to signs and wonders and
50:35
forget
50:36
who gave you the right to do that
50:40
we can't go through this life and be
50:43
successful and happy if you do not make
50:45
jesus christ your number one
50:47
before you start looking for someone
50:49
else to fill a void in your life
50:51
make sure jesus is there first
50:54
so i think we're probably going to have
50:56
to end this i might take
50:57
one more question quick one one more
50:59
question and then we have to go on to
51:01
something else
51:02
this is from i hope i'm saying this
51:03
right it's um karina
51:06
and she would like to know if you have
51:08
any insight on tattoos
51:11
this is another good one i love these
51:13
ones i have revelation on
51:15
because you know um
51:18
earthwise time i've been around for a
51:20
while may not look like
51:22
it and i think like a child because the
51:25
more i know god the more i
51:26
act like one and think like one
51:30
but for years i was told
51:33
that tattoos were a sin a crime against
51:36
god
51:36
a blaspheme in leviticus it talks about
51:40
them
51:40
it says you shall not mark yourself and
51:42
so people
51:43
let me give you the revelation god gave
51:46
me
51:47
that scripture was talking about the
51:49
culture of
51:50
that day this is in the old testament in
51:52
leviticus in the old testament
51:54
it said you shall not mark yourself with
51:57
the
51:57
marks of the dead
52:01
now in some of the new translations they
52:03
may have changed that scripture or say
52:05
you will not have tattoos on you but
52:07
that's wrong
52:09
because that's not the great translation
52:12
god does mark people himself as
52:15
invisible was a tattoo it is a visible
52:18
permanent mark he marked
52:21
cain in the bible remember that
52:24
when he had even killed label but so
52:26
people would not kill cain
52:28
god put a mark on him letting people
52:30
know do not kill him
52:32
that was a permanent visible mark in the
52:34
bible
52:35
it says some people will mark
52:38
me mark me put my marks
52:41
on them and so there are people who have
52:46
a permanent visible mark on them we in
52:49
this time and age we call that tattooing
52:52
and let me tell you even in heaven when
52:54
you get there
52:56
it says god will put his mark in your
52:59
forehead
53:00
the name of the city of your god will be
53:02
put a permanent visible mark
53:03
in your forehead and it will be put in
53:06
the palm of your hand
53:07
this is in the word of god people so
53:10
heaven puts permanent marks on you
53:12
it also says in the bible that god will
53:15
mark
53:17
144 000 jews that will do powerful
53:20
things for him
53:21
in the last day so what are you going to
53:24
say to those people you can't go to
53:25
heaven because you have those marks on
53:27
you
53:28
there will be people that will put marks
53:30
on their self because god has even asked
53:32
them
53:33
they will not represent hell okay these
53:35
marks cannot represent hell
53:37
because what you put on you says
53:40
who you serve yeah and so that part is
53:43
very important as signs of
53:45
things that represent death or hell
53:47
should not be put on your body
53:49
and if you had that done a long time ago
53:51
i would encourage you to go back
53:52
and have them changed i do know that
53:54
it's possible
53:56
i do know this in this great move of god
53:58
coming
53:59
where the fire of god will be loosed
54:01
over people he will actually erase
54:03
a lot of the other kind of tattoos off
54:06
of you
54:08
but you cannot put that as something you
54:09
can't just put in a box
54:11
because that scripture in leviticus says
54:13
in the culture of that day
54:15
they were marking themselves with
54:17
satanic marks all kinds of people
54:19
back in the way back in the day in the
54:21
old testament
54:22
they were cutting themselves and cutting
54:25
off parts of their body and giving them
54:27
to idols
54:28
worshiping idols okay it also says you
54:30
should not cut yourself
54:32
uh you should not worship a false god
54:34
all this was the culture that was taken
54:35
place
54:36
back in the old testament in this in the
54:38
leviticus
54:39
in those days so but it does say you
54:41
should not mark yourself with the marks
54:43
of the dead
54:44
i will also add this if you're young and
54:47
you are still living
54:48
under the covering of your parents don't
54:52
run out and get one just because i said
54:53
that to you
54:54
when you are on your own if you want to
54:57
have
54:58
something that represents heaven
55:00
revelation that is going to be your own
55:02
decision when you're out on your own but
55:04
don't do something that's going to call
55:06
cause grief in your family or strife in
55:08
your family okay
55:09
make sure that that is going to be okay
55:12
with with god
55:13
and if you're under your parents you
55:16
honor your father and your mother and
55:17
let me tell you i always did that
55:20
and if god ever tells me to get one i'm
55:23
going to wear it
55:24
i keep saying i may get it i'll make it
55:26
if you got better on my
55:27
face it'd probably be would we
55:31
a wing of the living creature with eyes
55:32
in it or something but right now i'm not
55:34
planning that
55:35
but i need to give you truth and that is
55:37
true that marking yourself
55:39
in today's world they would call that a
55:40
tattoo it doesn't it's not
55:42
all jesus has wrong jesus himself
55:46
has on his entire thigh has
55:50
written a permanent visible mark that
55:52
says
55:53
he is the king of kings those are
55:55
spiritual kings
55:56
and the lord of lords so our own lord
56:00
and savior
56:01
has that mark on him and god has used it
56:05
in the past and present
56:06
okay to let people know they live for me
56:09
they represent me
56:10
so go you be powerful re please
56:14
run after jesus christ first
56:17
get revelation ask for revelation
56:20
yourself
56:21
and we're going to end our session right
56:22
now so that i can go and do something
56:24
our q a session and go into something
56:26
else
56:27
and i hope you have a blessed day and i
56:30
release the
56:31
life of god in part the life of god
56:34
the joy of the lord in jesus name and so
56:38
we're going to go on to our next session
56:39
yeah we're just going to switch we're
56:41
going to switch topics right now
56:44
and we're going to talk about the
56:45
guardian zone yay
56:47
we love our guardian and we love this
56:49
because this is a plan that god
56:52
gave us again the things that we do
56:55
no matter what those things are if god
56:57
creates an event through us
56:59
or a move of god he's starting he has us
57:02
make a mark or a logo
57:03
for it because he's marking it as his it
57:06
will cause a move of god with whatever
57:08
that purpose is
57:10
and we love it when he does that and for
57:12
years
57:13
because my book was actually written in
57:16
2005 2006 my first book
57:19
and he gave me a deadline to have it
57:21
published by may of 2007
57:23
and it was i actually met that deadline
57:26
and it wasn't easy because i still lived
57:28
with all of with my family my
57:31
my mom my mom my sisters
57:34
a couple of my sisters lived with us my
57:36
niece
57:37
my daughters my husband and i we all
57:40
have one big home together
57:42
and i had to write that book in the
57:43
midst of that so all you people that god
57:45
have asked you to write you don't have
57:46
an excuse
57:47
you find time you do it he wants that he
57:50
needs that message given to people
57:52
whether it's just to make people laugh
57:54
to give them a
57:56
revelation on how to do any ideas and
57:58
inventions let's say it's
58:00
uh it's powerful revelation on the word
58:03
itself
58:04
uh maybe a prophetic book about things
58:06
to come you have to step out and start
58:09
that book
58:09
and i had to write it we're living with
58:12
all of that stuff going on
58:14
in my own home it was never quiet i
58:17
never had any really quiet time
58:19
and it's a good thing i do stay up and
58:21
my my greatest
58:22
creative time is from midnight to 4 a.m
58:24
is when i in those
58:25
hours that's when i wrote all my books
58:27
just when i do all my sketches most all
58:29
of them are done during that time
58:31
and so sometimes you just have to find a
58:33
way to do it
58:34
by the way at our our events we have
58:37
different events
58:38
and heavens invitation this is going to
58:40
be for free right now heaven's
58:41
invitation is coming up in june
58:44
and we will have a pr a free
58:48
author how to become a published author
58:51
or self-published author workshop
58:54
and when you can get something for free
58:57
that is a good thing
58:58
and there are different methods that you
59:00
can use to write and you stick to that
59:02
protocol
59:03
but let me tell you only 10 of all books
59:06
that are started
59:07
ever get published and it is possible to
59:10
get published so i want to encourage you
59:11
in that moment
59:12
but i'm going to talk about the guardian
59:14
zone and the holy spirit and the father
59:16
dropped this in my spirit
59:18
and we actually designed a logo several
59:20
years ago
59:22
which represented the guardian zone and
59:26
and that image that you're going to see
59:28
or you are seeing right now
59:30
it represents two flows something is
59:33
flowing in
59:35
so it can flow out so as the support
59:39
and supply comes in that's your giving
59:44
then the revelation can go out
59:47
and what people do when they join the
59:49
guardian zone
59:50
you're a member but we call you a
59:52
guardian how about that god
59:54
does love to give titles i know man
59:57
talks about not having titles but god is
59:59
really big on giving titles to people
60:01
especially in these powerful days we're
60:03
in now
60:04
so you will become a guardian by your
60:06
continual support in giving your
60:08
financial giving
60:09
and we actually have people right now on
60:12
phones that you can call this very
60:14
moment and they will answer the phone
60:17
they take down your information and
60:20
how you would like to give it it doesn't
60:22
matter if it's weekly
60:23
monthly you know it can be
60:26
annually whatever but most people choose
60:29
to give monthly or
60:30
or weekly whatever god puts in your
60:32
heart to give
60:33
whatever is in there to give it it helps
60:36
us to
60:37
release more revelation like the studio
60:40
it costs money okay it costs money and
60:43
you'd be surprised probably if you've
60:44
never done it
60:45
what it costs to do things like this
60:47
because we have really good cameras now
60:49
we have professional lights we have an
60:51
awesome media desk let me tell you what
60:55
my one sister
60:57
my one sister hello patty
61:00
uh paid for this media desk knowing what
61:03
would be used for
61:04
she will get reward because of
61:07
purchasing this for so we could have a
61:09
professional looking
61:11
desk to do all of our media and our
61:14
broadcast
61:14
we're going to be doing webinars really
61:17
they are going to be coming up
61:19
we're going to do webinars we're going
61:20
to do all kinds of things
61:22
from here we will actually have weather
61:24
warriors weather broadcast
61:26
we have a green screen that's uh we're
61:28
setting all that up so we can do stuff
61:30
with the green screen
61:31
and there'll be a point where we do
61:33
weather warriors
61:34
and you literally will see on the green
61:37
screen
61:38
the weather the destructive weather or
61:41
the threat of it you'll see it
61:42
on the green screen and as we're
61:45
declaring and decreeing over you may see
61:47
things
61:48
changed immediately or we will come back
61:52
the next day and show you the actual
61:55
thing that happened let's just say a big
61:58
tropical storm is coming and it was
61:59
building and growing it was
62:01
really getting bad and we all take
62:03
authority over that
62:05
in our with our weather warriors group
62:07
from all over the world now we have
62:09
people in every country now that do this
62:12
um and it's gonna be powerful and by the
62:14
way i might as well just tell you
62:15
we are planning a webinar for weather
62:18
warrior training instead of making
62:20
everybody come here to do that
62:22
we're already working on setting all
62:24
that up
62:25
sometime in the spring i can't give you
62:27
a date at this moment but we will have a
62:29
webinar it will cost a small fee
62:32
because we will need people to be here
62:34
that aren't normally here we'll have all
62:35
kinds of other stuff that we'll have to
62:37
have
62:38
and things going on it will not be very
62:40
much but let me tell you
62:42
it's cheaper than flying getting a hotel
62:46
and having to sit and wait in between
62:48
the events it will be
62:50
powerful focused training on how to be a
62:54
weather warrior
62:55
and you will be so filled with it and
62:57
trained with it no matter what comes up
62:59
anywhere and if you see or hear
63:01
something coming up in the world that is
63:03
destructive
63:04
you should take authority over it
63:06
because you're over the weather not
63:08
under it so there's my
63:09
free clip that's just one of the things
63:11
that some of our
63:12
funds are used for and some of these
63:15
funds that people are
63:16
you're giving right now that's what the
63:17
guardian zone is
63:19
is helping to support heaven's plan
63:24
to release heaven on earth and
63:27
create products that represent heaven on
63:29
earth
63:30
and put them in the marketplace and you
63:33
have to supply
63:34
for me because i don't get a big check
63:37
from a church somewhere you know i love
63:40
church by the way i'm going to give a
63:41
plug to church god is not abandoning the
63:44
church he's going to
63:45
settle set it free the ones who are
63:48
teaching deception like it's okay to
63:50
send all you want to you
63:51
that's called deception uh pray for
63:54
those people
63:55
but don't stay there okay the church
63:58
is the way god designed so that we could
64:01
all have
64:02
members to be together to fellowship
64:04
together
64:05
to break bread together and to help each
64:08
other
64:09
it's very important we have many
64:11
revivals in the past it wouldn't have
64:12
been possible if people
64:13
in churches involved in church were not
64:17
there
64:18
and so i do know there's a lot of home
64:19
churches as many new ways god is doing
64:22
things we're in a new time
64:24
in the spirit realm and in god's plan so
64:27
i'm all for home churches churches and
64:29
offices
64:30
these are people who teach the word they
64:32
they pray for people they have prayer
64:34
groups intercessory groups schools of
64:36
the spirit now schools of the
64:37
supernatural
64:38
it's just exploding everywhere so
64:40
there's many ways to get to know god
64:42
get more of god but these funds that you
64:46
give us
64:47
help to provide provide for me
64:49
personally
64:50
and to help take revelation places we
64:53
never could do it before
64:55
and it helps us to put new materials out
64:57
there for people
64:59
so i really appreciate every person and
65:02
many people have responded
65:04
to become a guardian and i'm just going
65:06
to share a little bit
65:08
the numbers are on the screen right now
65:10
to call and like i said we actually have
65:12
staff
65:12
right now waiting to take down your
65:15
information if you'd
65:16
like to become a member of the guardian
65:18
zone
65:19
and you don't want to go online yourself
65:21
to do it
65:22
you can actually call and they can take
65:25
all your information
65:26
and they will sign you up in the
65:28
guardian zone and then what you're going
65:30
to get
65:30
is i send revelation reports to you
65:34
at different times throughout the year i
65:36
have special gifts that are being
65:38
designed
65:38
as tokens of our appreciation that you
65:41
will receive
65:42
and every year you will get towards the
65:44
end of the year you'll get a real
65:45
beautiful collectible item
65:47
from my heart to yours and you will have
65:50
god's blessings on you because this is
65:52
heaven's plan
65:54
and so uh people have all kinds of
65:56
questions sometimes about this
65:58
god is not against people giving
66:00
especially
66:01
if it's his plan and it helps those who
66:04
are pouring out their life
66:06
to do what god is asking and if people
66:09
around this world weren't willing to
66:11
give their life to christ not just
66:13
receive christ
66:14
but spend their life giving the truth
66:18
praying for people i know powerful men
66:21
and women of god that are out there
66:22
right now around the world
66:24
helping people and giving to them
66:27
if they're doing that is a god thing
66:30
people complain about paying tithes or
66:32
giving offerings or
66:34
you know the bible is free the bible
66:37
itself
66:38
isn't free actually unless you go to a
66:40
group
66:41
like maybe the salvation army the
66:43
gideons you probably can get a free
66:44
bible
66:45
but all these bibles are being the
66:47
wonderful ones filled with truth
66:49
have all kinds of helps in them and
66:51
things that people spent
66:53
a lot of their life doing translations
66:56
in different languages
66:57
for different purposes we probably
66:59
eventually i don't know when
67:01
we'll probably have a revelation bible
67:04
filled with revelation on the word of
67:06
god itself
67:07
and the times and all those things right
67:09
now he's got me on many different
67:11
platforms doing things but i can tell
67:14
you those who are doing it
67:16
and then they put that in the bookstore
67:18
to be sold you cannot walk in a bible
67:20
bookstore
67:21
and just take products out of there and
67:22
walk away and say i'm taking these free
67:25
it's like going to anyone who has their
67:27
business and this is how they make their
67:29
money
67:29
and i want you to know that even jesus
67:31
made money on this earth he had a
67:33
business he was a carpenter
67:34
he didn't give it away for free that was
67:37
his living
67:38
paul worked with fabrics and i know he
67:40
did make tents but he also made banners
67:42
and all kinds of beautiful things
67:44
he made a living even while he was
67:46
ministering and when christ was
67:48
ministering i'm sure there was a point
67:49
where he did stop doing that
67:52
but it's okay to be in business and
67:54
minister
67:55
also at the same time and so you go to
67:59
the store and you go to places all the
68:00
time to spend your money
68:02
you're getting what you paid for but
68:05
here when we do things like this
68:06
and every day we're putting stuff out
68:09
there
68:10
i i believe right now there's probably
68:12
500 hours
68:14
on youtube of me talking about heaven
68:17
on every kind of subject possible and
68:20
that we do not charge for that we don't
68:22
charge of course for facebook
68:24
uh all the stuff we put out there when i
68:26
go and speak
68:28
you know when i go places i'm invited to
68:30
speak sometimes
68:31
they have to charge a fee because they
68:33
have to run to place they have to pay
68:34
security they have to pay the ushers
68:36
they have to pay people to come and be a
68:38
part of that
68:40
and so i can hear the phones ringing
68:41
right now that makes me very happy
68:43
but even ourselves in our own events
68:47
that we hold every single year we will
68:50
not ever charge people to attend those
68:53
events
68:54
that means that we are taking on all the
68:57
expense and i'm just going to give you a
68:59
tip
68:59
because some people never know if
69:02
somebody goes and they're going to hold
69:04
a big event like in a hotel
69:06
unless it's a three-day event and it's a
69:08
major hotel
69:09
they could be paying 20 000 to
69:13
rent the space in that hotel because
69:15
this is the hotel's property
69:17
you also bring most of the time your own
69:20
equipment
69:21
like your speakers your microphone your
69:23
technical
69:24
technical stuff you have to carry and
69:26
take it into these places
69:28
people are really blessed if they find a
69:30
church that might let them rent the
69:31
church
69:32
to have a meeting and so that's probably
69:35
a little bit
69:35
less expensive but i know we ourselves
69:38
in the past
69:39
we would pay like twelve hundred dollars
69:40
a day to be at the marriott those
69:43
meetings we held there they weren't free
69:44
for us but we didn't charge anyone
69:46
that's something god ask of me
69:49
personally
69:50
so our main events which would be
69:52
heaven's invitation
69:54
that's heaven inviting you to get
69:55
revelation that's always in june
69:58
okay then we have the dread champions
70:00
that is the manifested
70:01
sons of god that is for men and older
70:05
teens
70:06
teenagers boys uh that is just for them
70:09
and they have powerful events with the
70:12
men and then we have the wonder women
70:14
that is our all women event
70:18
and i can tell you what we shake hell
70:22
we shake hell we send the armies of
70:25
heaven
70:25
all over the world we had people women
70:27
from 40 almost 40 different places
70:31
i'm talking about countries that come to
70:33
these events
70:34
it's always going to be usually the
70:36
first weekend in november
70:38
and so uh we are already putting stuff
70:41
out there to save the save the date
70:44
for these meetings that are coming up
70:46
we're already making major plans for
70:48
them
70:48
and of course weather warriors will also
70:50
be an annual event
70:52
and uh like i said we're we are right
70:55
now creating a webinar
70:56
where we can do that and people from all
70:59
over the world will be able to join on
71:01
that webinar
71:02
we will get the dates to you as soon as
71:04
we have it all set up
71:06
like i said there'll be a small fee you
71:08
you'll pay that to join us you'll be
71:10
given a special link to go to
71:12
so that you can watch it and only the
71:14
people who up who will
71:16
sign up for that event for that webinar
71:19
they will be able to see it
71:21
and be trained powerfully it will be
71:23
over the course of two days that we will
71:25
have
71:26
that this is something new for us but we
71:28
will begin if i mentor
71:30
my mentoring in the future will only be
71:32
done the webinar so it's going to be
71:33
very powerful that we have this source
71:35
of media to use
71:37
so i'm just giving you some tips on what
71:39
do we do with that money
71:40
okay i am not just by myself i'm not
71:43
sitting here alone by myself
71:45
i have staff all around me i have staff
71:47
in the other rooms of our office right
71:49
now
71:50
one day we will have a huge place
71:52
because god has already shown me that
71:54
and i do know what will happen
71:56
and eventually we will have staff and
71:59
facilities around this world but this is
72:03
where we are starting okay
72:05
uh my my family you know we still
72:08
live here because right now this is
72:10
where god has us so it's like we're in
72:12
our office 24 hours a day that's what it
72:14
feels like sometimes
72:16
and so it powerfully helps us you know
72:19
god blesses us and the word talks about
72:22
giving offerings and sharing i don't
72:24
usually go into that part of it it's
72:26
what is in your heart
72:27
if you receive revelation if it has
72:29
changed your
72:31
life we will eventually one day actually
72:33
have a program
72:35
that does nothing but share testimonies
72:37
from around this world
72:39
of how revelation has changed their life
72:42
it's the more of god
72:43
it comes from his self it's from his
72:45
throne
72:46
and we love sharing that a lot of my
72:49
staff
72:51
learn to adapt to heaven culture that's
72:53
what we call it
72:54
and we explain in many of my messages
72:57
out there you learn how to live heaven
72:59
culture you learn how to take authority
73:01
you learn how to work with the army of
73:03
heaven
73:04
you are trained because it is our job
73:08
the bible says that the fifo ministry is
73:11
here
73:11
to train you we're not supposed to just
73:15
share a few good words
73:17
and sing a couple nice songs you need to
73:20
lead
73:21
changed okay we go from glory
73:24
to glory by getting more of god
73:27
and then applying it if you receive
73:31
if you go to church you get a powerful
73:32
message and they give things to inspire
73:35
you
73:35
and to help you that means you apply it
73:37
to your life
73:39
and so i tell people i'm not here just
73:41
to talk to you i'm here to help
73:42
change you and trust me
73:45
until you are walking in the spirit okay
73:49
that means your flesh has died to itself
73:52
when you walk in the spirit it blesses
73:54
the heart of god but your life begins to
73:56
be
73:57
it's like you breathe him in and you
74:00
breathe him out
74:02
walking in the spirit brings life
74:05
okay it even says that in the word of
74:07
god walking in the spirit is not
74:09
partnering with hell
74:10
not tolerating hell in your life all
74:13
that stuff is true in the bible
74:14
there is a hell i have been there and
74:16
seen it there certainly is a literal
74:18
heaven i've been there and seen it many
74:20
times
74:21
and god has powerful things for us right
74:23
now in this slide
74:24
so make sure you call the number on
74:28
there
74:28
and you join the guardian zone i will so
74:31
appreciate it
74:32
you can go online we do have a website
74:35
you can go to
74:36
if you're if you're if you're technology
74:38
based you certainly can go to
74:41
catker.com and you click on the treasury
74:45
and then you choose the guardian zone
74:48
this is the way you yourself you can go
74:50
on there and fill out all the
74:51
information
74:52
choose when you want to give how much
74:54
you want to give and then that will be
74:56
done
74:56
for you so there is an online way to do
74:59
it and believe it or not people who do
75:01
nothing but live in technology
75:03
don't understand there are actually many
75:06
many people
75:06
still in this world that don't even own
75:08
a computer that wouldn't know how to
75:10
operate a computer
75:11
some of them actually don't have cell
75:13
phones is that wild
75:15
so not everyone is buddies carrying
75:17
around their tablet or their ipad
75:20
totally connected to the world that way
75:22
there's still old school
75:24
people around and there probably always
75:27
will be
75:27
i know technology is changing everything
75:30
and we have to move with all of that
75:32
but but this is a way that you can give
75:35
the guardian zone is helping to support
75:38
heaven's plan
75:39
and i appreciate it so much that you
75:42

Soul Cleansing with Kat Kerr
by Santa Maria Healing Rooms Apr 21, 2021
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oG6cTG2zpEg
or https://youtu.be/oG6cTG2zpEg

00:00
and i was talking to him then he just
00:01
catches me up and begins to show me
00:04
a human soul what it looked like how he
00:06
made it why did he make it that way
00:07
how people can cause their soul to
00:09
prosper all the time
00:11
and then they'll live in divine health
00:14
there was a requirement about that
00:16
prospering here
00:18
so cat um well those of you who don't
00:21
know
00:21
the lord's been taking her to heaven for
00:23
several years and showing her things and
00:25
bringing her back and allowing her to
00:27
share with us so
00:28
let's just welcome cat kerr
00:30
[Applause]
00:35
your soul is one of the most amazing
00:36
parts of you of all
00:39
you change your very life by what you
00:41
feed it
00:43
you change how you feel about things by
00:46
what you say yourself
00:48
if you don't like you then change
00:52
change what you're saying change what
00:54
you're watching
00:56
change what you let other people say
00:57
around you because you need to guard
00:59
your
01:00
heart what goes in there is what you
01:03
will become
01:05
amen if you've never heard that before
01:08
it's revelation on your soul your soul
01:11
is what you
01:12
are people say well i'm this and that
01:15
no adam became a living
01:19
say it loud he became a living soul
01:26
that's how important it is to god that's
01:27
why he gave you a soul you could choose
01:29
yourself
01:30
you could choose with your will you can
01:33
think about things
01:34
choose it and then you do it and then
01:37
your emotions
01:38
display who and what you believe
01:42
with your life is probably one of the
01:45
least talked about things in the church
01:48
is a soul growing up i always heard that
01:51
it was bad
01:53
went but god made it right he it's one
01:56
third of us is that right
01:59
we'll always have our soul how why would
02:01
he make it bad
02:03
it's a powerful thing and it's a good
02:06
thing
02:06
because you can feel yourself with god
02:08
and then you'll be like him
02:10
you can talk about him then you really
02:12
believe he is real
02:15
you can feed your soul 24 hours a day
02:19
your body gets fed a few times a day
02:22
your spirit man gets fed once a week
02:26
most people go to church once a week
02:30
but your soul is fed all the time by
02:33
what you watch
02:35
what you say what people say to you you
02:38
can be crushed by tragedies and
02:40
you can't you can't forget it you hang
02:41
on to it somebody can wound and hurt you
02:43
and it stays there forever
02:45
your soul has layers and it collects
02:48
things in those layers
02:51
that's why you have a memory but your
02:54
layers
02:54
are supposed to be used for different
02:56
something different than that
02:58
every layer of you looks like you who
03:00
wants revelation on the soul let me see
03:02
your hand
03:05
i was shown one and the father spent
03:09
four hours with me earth time i never
03:11
usually know but i looked at my clock
03:13
and i was talking to him then he just
03:15
catches me up and begins to show me
03:17
a human soul what it looked like how he
03:19
made it why did he make it that way
03:21
how people can cause their soul to
03:22
prosper all the time
03:24
and then they'll live in divine health
03:28
there was a requirement about that
03:30
prospering
03:32
it says even as your soul prospers
03:35
you will prosper and you will be in
03:39
health that word be means live
03:42
it's called divine health so i
03:47
since i learned about this the father
03:48
taught me about that he said people can
03:50
lose
03:51
with the keys of the kingdom you can
03:52
loose things out of your soul
03:55
when you lose it it's gone
03:58
and that doesn't matter what it is he
03:59
started giving me this very long list of
04:02
things that you can lose from your soul
04:05
and he said i know most people bind the
04:06
devil with the keys to the kingdom
04:09
but they mostly never talk about the
04:11
loosing thing what are you going to do
04:12
with the leucine key
04:15
and yet the binding key is more
04:17
important to bind the things of god to
04:19
your soul because then they can't be
04:21
taken away
04:23
what you choose to bind to your soul
04:26
about god
04:27
will never be taken from you
04:31
and so people i know you know you still
04:33
want to bind the devil go ahead and do
04:35
it
04:37
i'd rather loose the stuff out of my
04:38
soul that he tried putting there
04:42
you know if you have an anger issue
04:43
anger anger angry all the time you don't
04:45
even know you're just
04:46
angry it's all comes out of you it's in
04:48
your soul
04:49
you choose with your will to lose that
04:51
that anger
04:54
then heaven comes down and they pull it
04:55
out say what's loose on earth
05:00
is loose in heaven you know how amazing
05:04
you would be if you didn't have all that
05:05
junk in there
05:08
especially wounds and wounds can keep
05:10
you from the things of god
05:13
as much as sin can
05:16
don't leave a wound in you because then
05:18
the enemy will come and try to use it
05:21
amen so tomorrow night not tonight
05:26
we're going to do a soul checkup i hope
05:29
you're coming who's coming tomorrow
05:30
night hope everybody's coming i hope
05:34
you don't want to miss tomorrow night
05:35
this is just the introduction
05:38
we're going to do some spiritual warfare
05:40
with the host
05:43
they'll be excited you may leave with an
05:46
army if you don't have one
05:50
they were made for us amen they won't
05:52

05:57

06:01
some fire
06:02
sent the angels already outside waiting

00:05
good morning everybody
00:07
[Music]
00:08
this is almost my morning
00:10
[Laughter]
00:13
how many people don't know me or know
00:15
anything about me anybody got dragged
00:17
here
00:18
[Laughter]
00:22
i'm so glad you're here i prayed for you
00:24
a long time ago
00:28
that people would understand heaven is
00:30
different
00:31
they live differently there uh hair
00:33
color is heaven culture
00:36
i didn't ask for this i am not a paint
00:39
care person well i am now
00:42
but years ago when the lord came to me
00:44
in person
00:46
because even as a child i would say if
00:47
jesus ever comes to me in person and
00:49
asks me to do something there's no way
00:50
i'm not saying yes
00:52
this is like an eight-year-old okay so i
00:54
was strange even back then
00:56
i've been a seer my whole life i was
00:58
born with that gift that does not belong
01:00
to the enemy
01:01
most people when you mentor mention the
01:03
seer or the spirit realm
01:05
they think you're part of the new age
01:06
movement
01:08
no it was around long before the new age
01:11
movement was here
01:12
okay it belongs to god it's sent from
01:15
heaven
01:15
he needs seers on this earth and he
01:18
needs prophets that are seers
01:21
more than anything else because we say
01:24
what we see whatever he takes us and
01:28
shows us
01:29
the difference between a prophet and the
01:31
seed of prophet is we actually get to
01:33
see what he's saying
01:35
not just hear him say it therefore we
01:38
give details
01:40
and i can assure you what i say to you
01:42
today will be things he told me
01:45
or showed me or both
01:48
and maybe things you never heard of
01:49
before or even thought of before
01:51
but i speak on behalf of heaven on this
01:54
earth
01:54
that is my commission it's not my gift
01:58
my gift my passion is photography
02:02
so you see before you a photographer
02:05
minding her own business
02:08
which is now god's business remember
02:12
when jesus said i must be about the
02:14
father's business remember when he said
02:16
that
02:18
i understand what he meant when he said
02:20
that
02:21
okay because he had the life of a
02:24
carpenter correct
02:25
say amen he was sent is a carpenter
02:29
corrupt right he was then as a
02:31
businessman
02:33
and he knew who he was long before he
02:35
got to that place of being a businessman
02:38
god loves business people because they
02:40
have openings that
02:41
a lot of people who are in you know if
02:44
they're
02:44
christian leaders or in any way
02:46
associated with a christian
02:49
i don't like to say religious because
02:50
god's not religious
02:53
he wants a relationship with you
02:56
and even that is sometimes new to people
02:58
that never heard that
03:00
man man created religion christ created
03:03
a relationship
03:05
he died for every single person
03:08
right on the planet he didn't die just
03:10
for a denomination
03:12
and saying that i was part of the
03:13
assemblies of god almost
03:15
all of my entire life and grew up in
03:18
that atmosphere which was
03:19
awesome we had holy spirit we had the
03:22
gifts working we had miracles
03:24
we sent missionaries all over the world
03:26
i helped to serve at our family church
03:29
not my dad's church but it was our
03:31
family's church i'm from a family of 15
03:34
children i'm number three that means i
03:37
died a long time ago
03:41
i also can read your thoughts
03:45
just a tip i belong to jesus christ
03:49
since i was four years old that was well
03:50
over 60 years ago i forget
03:52
how old i am because i don't look at age
03:55
god counts time by events
03:59
and so he chose me for a certain time on
04:01
this earth
04:02
to do things and say things for him i
04:05
never
04:05
asked to be caught up to heaven he
04:07
decided that
04:09
i was going to be a photographer i was
04:11
going to work in business i loved
04:13
working with ceos for over 25 years i
04:16
was working in business
04:18
he took me out of that at one point in
04:19
my life and he said i'm gonna prepare
04:21
you for what is coming
04:22
and the next season of your life he
04:24
didn't say it would be to be caught up
04:26
to having non-stop
04:28
to give revelation on what heaven is
04:29
like
04:31
i would have done it anyway because by
04:34
that time i was besotted with him
04:37
i sought him earnestly on purpose
04:41
fiercely for over 20 years now remember
04:45
i was born again at
04:46
four this is when i'm into my 20s by
04:49
this point in my life
04:50
and in my 30s i really passionately and
04:54
i raised
04:55
three children i'm married there's my
04:57
husband of 43 years sitting right there
04:59
y'all pray for him okay
05:01
he has to live with me i'm not normal
05:05
[Laughter]
05:08
you can't be normal when you've been to
05:10
heaven as many times as i have been
05:12
there
05:13
this is not really reality to me
05:16
standing here this is a vapor in time
05:20
your life right now is a vapor in time
05:23
your future is going to be so powerful
05:26
and great and grand
05:28
and i'm not just talking about when you
05:29
get to heaven i'm talking about because
05:31
of the time you live in right now
05:34
one of the most amazing fascinating
05:36
powerful times to be alive on the earth
05:38
is actually right now
05:40
and anytime god before he did something
05:43
great the enemy showed up to try to
05:45
steal
05:46
that time the enemy wants his time
05:49
his time is not yet and the father would
05:52
tell me all the time
05:53
he's only given satan a bump in the road
05:57
that's what he calls the tribulation in
05:58
the paris times
06:00
and there's people now even saying
06:01
they're not going to have that they're
06:03
wrong
06:05
i've seen god's timeline part of it and
06:08
he is going to
06:10
have those things happen for his own
06:12
purposes he needs them to happen in the
06:14
earth
06:15
they'll be for a short time but the
06:17
times we're entering into now will be
06:19
for generations maybe you didn't think
06:21
that again
06:22
i've seen 50 to 100 years into the
06:25
future
06:26
and the mere perilous times had not
06:28
happened
06:29
the tribulation had not happened and i
06:31
think it would be
06:32
better if we stop saying he's going to
06:34
come tomorrow
06:36
i will say he's going to come when the
06:37
father tells him to is the correct thing
06:39
to say
06:40
christ is coming back i absolutely
06:42
believe in the rapture
06:44
i absolutely believe that those times
06:45
will happen but those aren't these times
06:48
we haven't even done the works alone the
06:50
greater works
06:53
christ passionately said certain things
06:56
would happen and some of them
06:57
haven't even happened he's not willing
07:00
to wrap it up
07:02
and end it in the midst of darkness
07:06
amen things are getting greater and
07:09
greater
07:10
and more and more powerful in these days
07:12
we literally will learn to rule like
07:14
christ did in the earth
07:16
the bible clearly says don't tell me
07:19
what the word says i know what it says
07:21
people better know what it says
07:23
it says we will rule and reign with
07:24
christ now
07:26
say now and in the time to come
07:32
we will that's who we are we have
07:34
authority as believers if you're not a
07:35
member of the body of christ you have no
07:37
authority
07:40
you have no authority over satan you
07:42
have no authority in the spirit realm
07:44
you have no authority to speak for god
07:47
if you're not belong to jesus christ and
07:48
you have not had your sins washed away
07:51
you are not righteous i hope you say
07:53
amen
07:55
god does not agree with it's okay to sin
07:57
all the time whenever you feel like it
08:00
that's right god does not agree with
08:02
once you get saved
08:04
and if you if you sin and keep on
08:06
sinning the grace will cover it
08:08
that's only if you repent
08:12
that's what the word says is that
08:14
correct
08:18
christ is righteous and just if you
08:20
repent of your sins he will cleanse you
08:22
from all unrighteousness is that what
08:23
that says
08:24
that means when you sin say you're not
08:26
saved when you sin
08:29
something happens in your soul when i
08:31
have you say it that's why i do that
08:33
when you sin that makes you unrighteous
08:38
when you repent he wipes it away
08:42
and you are righteous
08:46
i just as blunt as i can be
08:50
i i love the truth i live by the truth
08:53
i have to myself
08:56
it doesn't matter that he catches me up
08:58
to heaven all the time shows me
08:59
mysteries takes me into the past takes
09:01
me into the future
09:02
i know what his heart is i know what his
09:04
words are i know what his ways are i
09:06
walk in them
09:07
i know his will is not always what ours
09:09
is
09:11
the best way you can live is his will
09:13
his way
09:15
not his will your way
09:18
he he desires so much for us to attain
09:20
to everything
09:22
that christ won for us
09:25
this is one of those times where we're
09:26
going to rise above
09:28
our lives and all the way we've been
09:30
living in the past that doesn't mean he
09:32
won't desire
09:33
holiness in our life that means we'll be
09:35
doing things we never dreamed we would
09:37
be doing
09:38
and therefore when he's going to do
09:40
something like that he has to clean
09:42
the platform off
09:45
a platform of man that platform of the
09:49
enemy and crush the enemy and push him
09:51
back
09:53
so that we will have freedom to move
09:55
around this earth
09:56
not just in this country which by the
09:58
way will be absolutely not just restored
10:01
but almost reborn
10:06
this is not the time for america to go
10:08
down the tube and end
10:11
we are this is what the father says you
10:13
are a baby country
10:15
you're still a baby you have begun to
10:18
walk in all that i desire
10:20
and i created you to do in this earth
10:24
you are it will be a great light to this
10:26
world
10:27
a place where people can come to know my
10:29
son
10:30
a place where they can walk in the glory
10:32
that is created by those who love
10:34
me a place where people come to see
10:38
the miraculous as a normal way of life
10:42
amen a place will come to america not to
10:45
find the american dream
10:47
but define me
10:51
a place where prosperity will happen
10:55
because two-thirds of the gospel has
10:57
been paid for
10:59
by people from this country
11:02
i am not going to ignore the cries or
11:05
the prayers of my people
11:07
they are precious to me they allow me to
11:09
give me permission to move and operate
11:11
on their behalf
11:13
and even over those who would take steal
11:15
and try to steal
11:16
cheat and steal and take this country
11:18
away
11:21
if you're interested the father calls
11:23
biden a villain
11:27
you should say amen
11:32
a villain in any movie is the worst
11:34
people
11:35
who promotes and carries out evil deeds
11:39
and the father is well aware of
11:41
everything that's going on behind the
11:42
barbed wire
11:45
and he's not going to tolerate it
11:50
because of the importance of these days
11:53
for god
11:54
for his son for holy spirit in this
11:56
earth and especially particularly a
11:58
miracle because it helps
12:00
others know and learn about jesus christ
12:03
and let me tell you that is not going to
12:05
stop happening
12:07
they have carried the message of the
12:08
gospel of the kingdom
12:10
they will now begin to carry the
12:12
knowledge
12:13
and the power of the glory
12:18
he is not going to give up his time for
12:20
the glory
12:22
to be seen and known in this world
12:24
there's actually
12:25
scriptures written about the glory of
12:26
god
12:28
the number one is christ in you
12:32
is the hope of glory
12:36
do you know what that means
12:39
that means you will begin to create
12:41
glory for god and you will carry that
12:43
glory
12:44
amen literally the light of god will
12:46
come from you
12:50
that scripture also means that you will
12:52
release that glory and operate in that
12:54
glory
12:55
how do you think the knowledge of it is
12:56
going to go around this world
12:59
we will demonstrate it
13:03
things beyond your imagination are the
13:05
days we're stepping into
13:08
because of that god won't even send new
13:10
creations
13:12
and inventions to this earth because
13:13
he's not willing for the wicked you have
13:15
them
13:17
say amen he's well aware of everything
13:21
that's going on
13:22
he's not oblivious to it it's not that
13:25
he doesn't care
13:26
he does care he just has a plan
13:29
amen and it may not line up with man's
13:31
dates that they keep trying to give that
13:33
he's going to do something
13:35
they were all wrong or he would have
13:37
done it
13:39
he won't even give me a date he'll say
13:40
i'm going to do this
13:42
and i'll say god's going to do this it
13:44
doesn't bother me that it doesn't happen
13:46
for a year or several months or even
13:48
weeks i've waited 45 years before for
13:51
him to do something he promised me
13:53
and i never gave up and he did it
13:56
amen my family understands faith we
14:00
lived by faith
14:03
god was welcome in our home so his holy
14:05
spirit so was jesus christ
14:06
he was our healer you got 15 kids you
14:10
need jesus as your healer
14:13
from being shot point blank with a
14:15
shotgun
14:16
to being bit by deadly spiders
14:20
from being hunted by people kidnapped
14:22
and then brought back
14:25
we stood in faithful albums and every
14:28
one of them
14:29
we had victory why can i not stand
14:33
for a few months to see god act in my
14:36
country
14:38
and in my nation this is not just about
14:40
america
14:41
this is about the whole world right now
14:45
he is exposing evil all over the world
14:49
in great detail and most people will be
14:53
shocked and i promise you
14:54
you will know what was going on
14:57
you actually see the evidence hear the
15:00
hear hear the testimonies see the videos
15:04
of the horrific things that have been
15:06
already got they already have the
15:08
evidence right now this moment i'm
15:09
standing here they have the evidence
15:12
and i will promise you this trump is our
15:14
president
15:18
if you don't want that you need to lose
15:19
something out of your soul
15:22
because you're fighting against god not
15:25
trump
15:27
god picked somebody who couldn't be
15:29
bought who couldn't be forced
15:31
who couldn't have fear put in them who
15:32
could not be controlled
15:34
he picked him on purpose and he picked a
15:36
businessman
15:39
he has already proven himself that he
15:41
loves this country and he loves the
15:43
people in this country
15:44
and there's actually you should know by
15:46
now persecution comes because the enemy
15:49
doesn't like certain things
15:52
the persecution is the proof that you're
15:54
going to get what you ask for
15:58
you have properties and lands
16:01
and blessings in this life with
16:04
what say persecution
16:08
you should always rejoice when
16:09
persecution comes
16:11
that means you're doing exactly what god
16:12
wants
16:13
[Applause]
16:14
it's really evidence i rejoice i compass
16:18
and say man you should be rejoicing and
16:20
dancing
16:21
you've got all that persecution you're
16:22
going to get something great from god
16:25
and he never saw it that way i said
16:28
that's how jesus seems
16:31
he wasn't concerned at all about
16:32
persecution
16:34
he didn't care that the religious
16:35
hierarchy didn't like him he was a
16:37
threat to them
16:40
he was also a character when he walked
16:42
in this earth he was funny
16:44
people loved to be with him even sinners
16:48
i'm sure he captivated them in
16:50
revelation they never expected to hear
16:52
they heard words they never heard before
16:54
and it made them burn inside
16:58
people burn in heaven because of the
17:01
revelation they live in
17:04
in the parts of god they see you never
17:06
got to see
17:07
they get to see parts of the future they
17:09
get to see parts of the new earth
17:11
they saw how things were done by god way
17:14
in the past
17:15
before even the physical realm was
17:17
created
17:19
your family members are living in the
17:21
greatest place possible
17:23
they are happy they're rejoicing they're
17:25
blessed beyond measure
17:27
they have mansions no human hands can
17:29
afford to build
17:32
your mama and your dad your grandparents
17:35
great grandparents
17:36
don't want to come back not because they
17:39
don't love you but they're one of the
17:40
one who loves them the most
17:44
you can have the understanding of that
17:46
love
17:47
it makes it a lot easier to live in this
17:49
world
17:50
when you see it through christ's eyes
17:52
when he was on that cross
17:54
dying for all of us
17:58
and he understood that people didn't
18:00
understand they didn't have a clue
18:03
the ones who were even reviling against
18:05
him at that point
18:06
he died anyway didn't he
18:11
what little is it to us to die to our
18:13
flesh sometimes
18:15
if we have a choice to be kind to
18:16
someone even if they're being mean to us
18:19
it's one of the greatest things you can
18:21
do to pierce the enemy
18:25
you pierce the heart of the enemy when
18:28
you
18:28
love instead of fighting back against
18:30
people
18:32
when you're kind even when you're spent
18:34
is fought upon
18:35
or mistreated or wrongfully accused
18:38
when you choose to love doesn't mean
18:40
you're just being foolish
18:42
it means you're piercing the enemy
18:48
your worship also pierces the enemy
18:51
it goes right through the second heaven
18:53
maybe you didn't know about that
18:55
satan has built his own little tiny tiny
18:57
kingdom up there
18:58
he sits on a throne of skulls and
19:02
he rules from up there because he's a
19:04
prince in power in the air
19:07
so he can do things in the spirit realm
19:09
the spirit realm is both
19:11
both sides are there all the time this
19:14
is not heaven
19:15
all right you're not living in heaven
19:17
right now we're having more
19:19
heaven sent down than ever before that
19:21
heaven
19:22
is not deserved and neither is hell
19:27
heaven is beyond your imagination with
19:29
the glory with the beauty the splendor
19:31
the creativity the wonder of being there
19:35
in his presence all the time with him
19:38
you ride on your worship
19:39
across the skies of heaven into the
19:41
throne room
19:43
you're transported through beams of
19:45
light from one side of heaven to the
19:46
other
19:48
the food is everywhere there's no weight
19:49
gain or food allergies on heaven
19:52
everyone is young there is no age there
19:55
is no time
19:57
there's amazing fun exciting things to
20:00
do
20:01
because the father is a father it says
20:06
you must be like a little child because
20:08
when you get there you're going to be
20:09
shocked to see how many fun things he
20:10
made for you
20:11
[Music]
20:12
you may be 90 now but you feel like
20:14
you're 9 when you get there
20:19
there's laughter everywhere in heaven
20:23
people love it it is love because he's
20:26
there
20:28
and he chose this time not
20:31
us many people are in fear
20:34
they shouldn't be if they belong to him
20:36
he actually said i have not given you a
20:37
spirit of fear
20:38
but of power say power
20:42
i want you to notice that's the number
20:43
one thing he says has given us he gives
20:45
us
20:46
power that power he gives us as a
20:49
believer is over
20:50
all the power of the enemy
20:53
that means no matter what's going on
20:54
around us we have authority to speak
20:56
against that
20:58
you have authority to speak against
20:59
anything the enemy is doing to you
21:02
because jesus gave us that
21:05
every demon should run in fear when you
21:07
get up in the morning
21:10
hell should tremble when you open your
21:11
mouth and speak things to people
21:14
amen because you have authority in your
21:17
mouth
21:18
you have the word of god you have the
21:22
power of god
21:23
you have the life of god you get
21:26
revelation
21:27
you have you have his plans his will for
21:30
your life
21:31
he chose you and put you on the earth
21:33
that's why you're here right now
21:35
no matter who you were birthed out of
21:37
you were birthed from him first
21:40
and he went down his timeline and chose
21:42
when you would be here
21:44
because he needs you here
21:48
so these days are going to be different
21:50
than anything we've ever lived before
21:52
i've already seen these days i've seen
21:55
well into the next 50 years
21:59
that should be normal
22:02
so i have no fear of anything he holds
22:06
my life in his hand
22:07
and the father holds the breath of every
22:10
being on this earth
22:13
and there are some so wicked he said all
22:15
i have to do is remove it and they're
22:17
out
22:19
there are some very wicked people in
22:20
this world right now they may not live
22:23
through this
22:27
yes god has done that before in the past
22:28
he wiped everybody off the earth it was
22:30
so wicked
22:32
as bad as it is right now it is not as
22:35
bad as it was to the tase of noah
22:38
i know people think it is but it's not
22:41
it's i'm not i talk about those horrific
22:43
things that they did back then
22:46
but there are people wicked enough to
22:48
want that to happen
22:51
and the thing is when the enemy finds
22:52
enough and he's actually found a lot
22:55
of humans who are willing to do things
22:57
his way
22:58
but the enemy's already lost because
23:01
this is not his time
23:04
even when it is his time he's not going
23:06
to get what he wants
23:08
because even those who are believers at
23:10
the time of the tribulation
23:13
and the parasites will be some of the
23:15
strongest believers ever walked on this
23:16
earth
23:18
they won't even be afraid to die i know
23:21
i've seen the movies
23:23
from the time i was young i've seen the
23:24
movies about
23:27
you know during those days how bad it
23:29
will be uh nobody will be forced to take
23:31
the mark
23:32
the mark is not the michael chip you
23:34
can't see it
23:37
that mark satan's going to put on people
23:38
will be seen three blocks away
23:41
because he's full of himself and he
23:44
wants people to know who gave themselves
23:46
to him
23:47
so that won't be something that is
23:48
forced on anybody
23:51
he wants people to willingly do that and
23:53
right now he's found a lot of willing
23:55
people
23:56
but it's still not the time for him to
23:58
have authority in this earth
24:01
therefore god is going to take and wipe
24:04
the platform clean not just in america
24:07
but he will remove evil
24:09
from many different places and high
24:11
authority and leadership in many
24:12
different countries
24:13
around this world
24:16
i know everybody said well we're going
24:18
to have the harvest it still won't be
24:19
the final harvest
24:21
the first waves of harvest we get those
24:23
people need to be mentored
24:25
to walk in the supernatural and learn
24:28
how to roll with jesus christ
24:31
so we don't know how to do that how are
24:34
we going to mentor them
24:37
we can't be normal we cannot be normal
24:42
you can't live your life every day like
24:44
it's the same you live your life with
24:46
passion and excitement
24:48
that we've been given great authority
24:51
actually he gave us the earth amen
24:54
we are stewards of this earth we're
24:57
stewards of what goes on around here
25:00
and god said i will allow what you allow
25:03
i will not allow what you don't allow
25:06
that's also in the bible so why are we
25:09
allowing things
25:13
everything you say from your mouth is
25:15
written down
25:18
you should go back and read the scripts
25:21
i started counting my words a long time
25:23
ago
25:25
because i see scribe angels writing
25:27
things down
25:32
about ten years ago i woke up and there
25:34
were two things sitting on the end of my
25:36
bed
25:37
and then one scribe angel looked at me
25:39
said we have been sent for the words of
25:41
all the leaders in the body of christ
25:44
at this point now we will write down
25:45
everything they say
25:47
whether in public or in private
25:50
and from those words are speaking god
25:53
will decide who will have a leadership
25:55
in these great
25:56
end days and who will not
25:59
have leadership those who will operate
26:02
in power and authority
26:04
those who will not allow to operate in
26:06
power and authority
26:07
if there's sin in their lives they will
26:10
not be allowed to operate
26:12
not in these greater days of glory he
26:15
said people can
26:16
fake many things they can fake being in
26:18
the five-fold ministry
26:20
they can fake by things they say and yet
26:22
they're sinning behind the scenes
26:25
but god sees everything that's right
26:29
he's not watching you to hit you over
26:31
the head with something
26:32
he's watching you to see what is in your
26:34
heart
26:36
what do you desire to do for others
26:41
that thing to esteem others more highly
26:43
than yourself goes a long way in heaven
26:46
i was raised that way
26:50
my dad was raised that way i'm from
26:52
seven generations
26:53
of believers who actually believed
26:58
i was the one who didn't want to be
26:59
known or seen by anybody
27:01
i was not someone who would put pink in
27:03
my hair was the quiet one
27:07
watch out for the quiet ones they're
27:10
thinking
27:11
and they're watching all the time
27:15
i can just tell you god had a plan for
27:17
my life i had a little plan i was going
27:19
to get me a nice apartment
27:20
and be in some big company
27:23
because i loved working in business i'd
27:25
like to see things happen
27:27
and god had another plan no i'm going to
27:31
give you pink hair i'm going to take you
27:32
up to have a non-stop
27:34
and you're going to go all over the
27:35
world and speak to everybody you're
27:36
going to hug them and let them
27:37
kiss you on the cheek if they want to
27:41
i was not a person that wanted to be
27:42
hugged or kissed by anybody
27:46
and yet i mean been kissed thousands of
27:48
times by people
27:49
around the world you know greet each
27:52
other with a brotherly kiss
27:54
that kind of a kiss so he's changed me
27:58
he's changed the way i think the way i
28:00
look at people i look at him through his
28:02
eyes
28:04
he loves you more than you ever ever can
28:07
imagine
28:08
no matter who you are even what you've
28:10
done even with your failures with your
28:12
mistakes
28:14
things that you gave up on he has not
28:16
given up on you
28:18
and he has not given up on this country
28:21
amen he has repeatedly told me america
28:24
is not evil
28:27
it isn't america itself is not
28:30
it's one nation under god
28:34
and he says that to me all the time it's
28:36
my country
28:38
it's mine and he said in 2015 i put my
28:42
hand
28:42
on the country and i turned that map red
28:49
and he had already declared that trump
28:51
would be president for eight years
28:54
knowing every single thing that would
28:55
happen
28:57
and god says oh no he means right now
29:01
not talking about in 2024 he's talking
29:03
about right now
29:07
he said to me trump won the election
29:10
he didn't lose that makes him president
29:14
the other side lied and cheated
29:17
that disqualifies them he said if in the
29:20
olympics they are caught cheating
29:23
they are not congratulated they are not
29:26
honored they're not rewarded they are
29:29
removed and they have
29:33
absolute all the proof they need that
29:35
that happened just because the civil
29:37
courts wouldn't hear the cases doesn't
29:38
mean justice is not coming
29:42
and i can promise you trump knows all of
29:45
this
29:46
he's not been lazy he's been very busy
29:49
behind the scenes so are many other
29:51
smart
29:52
smart and intel smart people around the
29:55
world
29:56
that know what is right and what is not
29:58
right
30:00
and they don't need any more evidence
30:01
than they have to take all of them to
30:03
prison or
30:04
be shot for treason
30:08
these i'm speaking truth not making it
30:10
up
30:11
this is true trump is still our
30:14
president
30:14
he won the election uh on the election
30:17
date
30:18
and when they said we're going to stop
30:20
the counting
30:22
the holy spirit who is right beside me
30:24
said
30:25
that's really going to cheat and steal
30:27
and change all the votes
30:30
he said that to me right when they said
30:32
those words we're going to stop the
30:33
voting
30:33
we'll pick it up tomorrow and then we'll
30:35
see what happens well
30:37
by that time almost 80 million people
30:39
had already voted for trump
30:41
yes and if you'll notice you never saw
30:45
biden's people
30:47
he never had rallies because he had no
30:49
people
30:51
but they didn't know what they were
30:52
going to do they knew from the beginning
30:54
they would cheat they already had their
30:56
plans laid out that all those the voting
30:58
machines and the dominion system
31:01
already working on their behalf and i
31:03
know most of you weren't aware of that
31:05
but they switched so many votes
31:08
overnight that before trump can switch
31:09
them to biden
31:11
and finally there's one county that is
31:13
given permission
31:15
to recount have 2.1 million of the
31:18
ballots
31:19
looked at individually all over again to
31:21
make sure that they were counting
31:23
but that's still not how he's going to
31:25
be put back in office
31:27
there's already things that have
31:28
happened even in our military
31:30
i will tell you this that the ones who
31:32
are sitting there illegitimately god
31:34
says
31:35
are illegitimate in in dc he says the
31:37
ones behind barbed wire that's how he
31:39
talks about him
31:40
[Music]
31:43
are still hoping we will give up
31:46
and let them do what they want to and
31:49
this is what the father says
31:51
there was a couple things they never
31:53
considered when they plotted this whole
31:55
thing
31:56
together with the intel you know with
31:58
the wicked rich with the fake
32:00
news media i mean there's so many that
32:02
are going to be probably be
32:04
either put in prison lose what they have
32:05
built up lose their fortunes
32:08
because they will have been busted
32:12
you're going to lose they'll lose all
32:13
the way around there's no way they will
32:15
ever win
32:15
anything or have anything this is from
32:18
the father himself
32:19
he said number one they're trying to do
32:21
this in a country that already
32:23
is free they're not going to a third
32:27
world country
32:28
that isn't free they're trying to take
32:30
things away from americans
32:32
they're different they were born free
32:35
they live free they make up their own
32:38
mind
32:39
they want a future he said there'll
32:41
never be civil war that's what they were
32:42
hoping for
32:43
that we would be killing each other
32:46
he said but americans true americans the
32:49
red-blooded americans
32:51
have a hope for a dream and a future
32:54
they have a family they want a life and
32:57
they want to live
32:59
and they are not willing to give it up
33:02
they didn't vote for evil
33:04
they didn't choose evil he said an evil
33:06
is not in power right now
33:09
he will remind you of a scripture and
33:11
the righteous
33:12
are in power that people rejoice is that
33:15
what it says
33:17
well trump isn't power the other side is
33:20
not
33:21
they're illegitimate they stole the
33:24
election
33:25
he knows that almost 80 million people
33:28
know
33:28
that it was stolen because everybody
33:30
knows who they voted for
33:32
amen so this is an epic time in our
33:35
country
33:36
to show when truth prevails
33:40
and the people prevail this country
33:43
belongs to god
33:45
and we the people amen
33:48
the other thing they will never consider
33:52
[Applause]
34:00
and god says all the time i'm in your
34:02
papers
34:03
i'm on your money
34:07
i'm written in your in your constitution
34:09
you said i'm everywhere
34:10
because i was allowed to be in this
34:12
country
34:14
he said when you look at the two
34:15
differences between the illegitimate
34:17
ones
34:18
and the actual president i am welcome
34:22
in this country by trump
34:26
he even made that statement many times
34:28
he recognizes who god is
34:30
he invites god to be here he he loves
34:33
christians he loves their faith he loves
34:35
the
34:36
the churches he loves and he wants us to
34:38
have freedom and according to our
34:40
constitution
34:41
we have every right to have church to
34:44
come together to meet
34:46
is that correct so when the other side
34:49
wants to wipe it out
34:51
disallow it abolish it and crush it that
34:54
should show you right there
34:55
they're lost they have already lost what
34:58
they want to plot and plan
35:00
i'm not willing for that to happen amen
35:05
and with all the prayers that have come
35:07
forth on behalf of this country
35:09
you need to know that when you pray they
35:11
fill these bowls before the altar of god
35:15
your prayers your worship fill these
35:17
huge bowls
35:19
and when they're full god tips them when
35:21
they're tipped
35:22
a whole new move of god comes to this
35:24
earth so what is about to happen
35:26
isn't crash and burn to be destroyed is
35:29
about to be
35:30
wiped clean of the evil and a powerful
35:33
move of god is about
35:34
to hit this country
35:36
[Applause]
35:42
and this is what the one who made
35:43
everything is saying
35:45
amen his words count above the others
35:48
right
35:49
amen but jesus christ wants
35:52
is he not is not the earth his and the
35:55
bones thereof
35:56
the earth is who the lord
35:59
and the fullness thereof
36:02
then if it is his and he's already got
36:05
this time planned who do you think is
36:07
going to win
36:09
jesus it doesn't matter how bad it looks
36:12
or sounds
36:14
and i would encourage everybody to stop
36:15
watching the fake news
36:19
because they plotted and planned to
36:21
brainwash people all along
36:24
they understand how that works and they
36:26
have done that to many people
36:28
i have family members i have friends
36:30
that listen to it
36:31
and all they know is this they hate
36:33
trump they can't even tell you why they
36:35
hate it they just know they hate him
36:37
right and so they're brainwashed into
36:40
thinking
36:40
he's so bad they gotta vote for the
36:42
other side they don't even know what the
36:43
other side stands for
36:45
i know i met somebody the other day
36:47
before i came
36:48
oh i like who's in there now i said you
36:50
like evil
36:53
you want terrorists to come into our
36:55
country
36:56
without any boundaries you want human
36:59
trafficking and drugs to keep
37:01
rushing into our country without anyone
37:03
stopping them
37:04
you want law and order taken away so
37:06
people can come and burn your place or
37:08
take whatever they want to from you
37:10
and they're looking at me really strange
37:11
well that's not what's going to happen i
37:13
said they've already signed papers
37:16
are you not listening to what they're
37:18
saying
37:19
oh no i just know they're good and trump
37:21
is bad
37:25
and that's what some people think they
37:28
don't have a clue
37:30
because they were taught for all those
37:32
years continually
37:34
when the same thing is put into you over
37:36
and over again in your soul and you
37:37
don't stop it
37:38
or you don't lose it from there it
37:40
builds in you
37:42
as a man thinketh in his heart that's
37:45
your soul
37:46
so is he that means what you let
37:50
in is what you will become
37:53
your heart he talks about the bible all
37:55
the time isn't this human beating heart
37:58
it's the core the word heart means the
38:01
core of something
38:03
the center of something the core of your
38:04
being is your soul
38:07
you are a soul that's what god said when
38:09
he made adam he became a
38:11
living soul that is very key
38:16
the other thing the body of christ needs
38:17
to learn is what does that mean
38:19
why is my soul so important why do you
38:21
think he says to guard it
38:24
you decide what goes in there you decide
38:26
what you watch
38:27
what you hear and what you say
38:30
and all three of those things will
38:32
affect who you are
38:34
that's what will come out of you what
38:36
you allow in there
38:39
if you don't like you maybe you should
38:40
change what you're saying or what you're
38:42
watching
38:44
because it will influence your soul is
38:47
your mind what you think about
38:49
your will what you choose and your
38:51
emotions
38:52
how you respond to all that what do you
38:54
act out in your life
38:56
what do you actually say about you are
38:59
you manifesting from christ
39:01
his character his purposes his words
39:04
clearly written
39:08
because that's what he wants from us the
39:10
world should look at us
39:12
and see christ when they hear us they
39:14
should hear christ
39:16
is that right does christian mean
39:19
christ's life then we need to start
39:22
acting like that
39:24
because when you do you terrify the
39:26
devil
39:28
if he can't crush you and put fear in
39:31
you which has always been his greatest
39:32
weapon
39:33
his second greatest weapon is deception
39:37
he's been working overtime with
39:38
deception
39:40
deceiving people taking up parts of the
39:42
word making whole bibles that
39:44
left hope books of the bible out or
39:47
twist what they say
39:49
i tell people make sure if you read the
39:50
word of god it's got the whole counsel
39:52
of god
39:55
there's some that take out the the
39:57
millennial reign of christ
39:59
they even take out the tribulation some
40:01
of them even say it's okay to sin
40:06
and there's some people never heard any
40:07
of this before but it's true
40:10
because the enemy is doing whatever he
40:12
can to deceive us
40:13
amen and obviously some people have been
40:16
deceived by believing
40:18
a lie so i don't work for hell
40:22
i don't represent hell i have nothing to
40:25
do with hell
40:26
there's no darkness in me i do not
40:28
tolerate any acts or words or thoughts
40:31
of the enemy
40:32
yes yes i serve the most high god and
40:36
him alone will i serve
40:39
it's okay with me if people don't like
40:40
my pink hair they will be taken to the
40:43
welcome center when they get to heaven
40:47
because you see people with every color
40:49
of hair in heaven
40:52
that's where the rainbow lives
40:56
and the one who carried you you lived in
40:59
that rainbow before you came here
41:02
you had a little spirit of life that was
41:03
your little spirit person
41:05
lived in the father that's why we are
41:08
his offspring you wrote on the rays of
41:12
the rainbow in and out of him
41:14
you played in the river of life inside
41:16
of him you jumped on the stones of fire
41:19
that burn with passion for you and
41:21
online
41:22
and that river of life goes over those
41:24
those gemstones massive gemstone filled
41:27
with a fire
41:28
it shoots that rainbow out of him
41:32
you lived there
41:36
so he made a plan with the words
41:39
on how to bring redemption how to bring
41:41
mankind back
41:43
to him in heaven some of the angels
41:46
still call jesus christ the word
41:49
you all know what the bible says the
41:51
word was with god
41:53
and was god and there was nothing that
41:55
was made that was not
41:57
made by him he had flesh put on
42:02
him he agreed to come and die and that
42:05
put on that cross and carry to that
42:07
cross
42:08
every sin wicked evil
42:12
act word intentions he drank it in the
42:16
cup in the garden
42:18
even when he didn't want to did he give
42:21
up his will
42:23
did he say to the father not my will but
42:26
your will be done and he drank all that
42:28
evil
42:29
he died in the garden when he
42:32
surrendered himself
42:33
because it wasn't just his body that had
42:35
to hang on that cross
42:38
every evil act and sin
42:41
had to be put on that cross and someone
42:44
who was perfect and holy
42:45
had to carry that to the cross he was
42:49
guiltless
42:50
he was innocent no sin
42:53
in his life even when he walked on this
42:55
earth
42:56
and yet he was willing to take that in
42:58
him that
43:00
is why he is the only one
43:03
who can forgive your sins because he
43:06
took
43:07
those sins to the cross there's no other
43:10
being that can do that for you there's
43:12
no other religion out there
43:14
that can say that you can get into
43:16
heaven
43:18
he is your way back to the father and
43:21
part of his reward was when you die
43:23
and moved to heaven you're not lost
43:26
you didn't lose somebody they moved
43:30
jesus christ is to walk you up the steps
43:33
of the throne
43:34
and say hear father i have brought your
43:36
son
43:37
or your daughter back to you
43:42
that is why heaven rejoices and throws
43:45
the biggest
43:46
party ever every time someone comes home
43:50
because
43:50
jesus is going to get to do that that's
43:53
part of his reward
43:56
he loves to call you to get undone and
43:58
when you step out of whatever you came
44:00
in whether it's one of heaven's
44:01
elevators whether it's a starship or
44:04
it's christ's
44:05
chariot there's many ways he can take
44:07
you up to heaven
44:09
when you get out you'll step into the
44:11
river of life right there coming out of
44:13
the city
44:13
and he will start throwing water on you
44:18
and you will have a water fight
44:21
that's what you will have and you're
44:23
going to see people
44:24
dancing and singing all over even
44:27
outside the gates
44:28
they'll be celebrating there's music
44:31
everywhere
44:32
the flowers sing the trees seeing the
44:35
ground is alive
44:36
the sky is alive and you're stepping
44:39
into life
44:40
and some people like i thought we
44:42
couldn't play music
44:46
i thought it was going to be silent in
44:48
heaven
44:49
that was only one dime it was only one
44:52
time it was silent in heaven
44:54
that was it not since then
44:59
you look for someone to be quiet you'll
45:00
find a place and then the trees will
45:02
start talking to you
45:04
or the rocks or the creatures
45:09
there's life everywhere so they have
45:11
actually got a welcome center i'm not
45:13
making it up
45:14
you're going to laugh even harder when
45:15
you see the humor of god
45:19
this whole family i knew growing up in
45:21
our city that owned
45:22
all the funeral homes were strong
45:25
believers they had compassion and
45:27
kindness for people
45:29
and one of the heads of all that was
45:31
about ready to go home to heaven and god
45:33
had me take this paper scroll
45:37
paper and write in gold ink his word for
45:40
that man
45:42
that was ready for me to get a word for
45:44
a person i usually prophesied
45:46
corporately
45:47
and i took it to the funeral home he was
45:49
even in his 90s he was still there
45:51
greeting people's families he had known
45:54
for a long time
45:55
and he's about to go inside and i said
45:56
richard could i give you something
45:59
and he said well what do you have i said
46:01
i have a word from god for you and he
46:03
started to cry
46:06
on the sidewalk he said all my years of
46:10
living
46:10
and caring and loving no one has ever
46:13
given me a word from god
46:14
[Music]
46:16
i said well he's gonna tell you your
46:18
future in heaven
46:20
gonna tell you what you're gonna be
46:21
doing and god wrote all these beautiful
46:24
words about him about
46:26
he had been given a heart to care and
46:28
great compassion
46:29
and understanding to help people go
46:31
through a
46:32
time in their life and god said you
46:35
always got them
46:36
when they were going to heaven but now
46:41
you will get them when they're coming to
46:43
heaven because i'm putting you
46:45
and all your family in charge of the
46:46
welcome center
46:50
and this is the hillary said you may
46:52
tell everybody
46:53
that you now your family now gets them
46:56
going and coming
47:02
and he was so undone and i said god
47:06
would not let me just speak that word to
47:08
you he has this scroll prepared
47:11
as if he had handwritten himself it was
47:14
this beautiful paper parchment paper
47:16
i said this is your word and when you go
47:19
home in a couple of weeks
47:21
she said you'll be going in a couple of
47:23
weeks you can let your brother know
47:25
who's remaining
47:26
what his future will be i said when he
47:29
said that to me
47:30
right yeah he took me up to heaven i saw
47:33
your brothers they all look alike
47:35
i saw your brothers i saw your father in
47:38
this beautiful building
47:39
and i saw people when they would get out
47:41
of these transports and they're like
47:42
this
47:44
[Laughter]
47:47
and they would walk in and say come on
47:49
we're going to make it all okay
47:52
yes you're in heaven i know it's more
47:54
than you ever dreamed just come with us
47:55
and we're going to explain
47:57
and they had such compassion and
47:59
kindness for the people
48:02
and i love to tell that story because it
48:04
shows you the humor of god
48:06
but the reward of god he doesn't forget
48:09
the kind acts that you do
48:11
so i actually can say and you can say
48:13
you know who's running the welcome
48:14
center
48:15
it is the heritage family from the
48:17
hardest people
48:21
and and i went to visit him once when he
48:23
was in the hospice and i took him a
48:25
picture of the portal in heaven i've
48:27
been taken to
48:28
where people look down and see their
48:30
families and they can declare over them
48:32
they go every year to sing happy
48:33
birthday to you from from heaven
48:36
and it's a beautiful place i was taken
48:37
to they have them all over heaven
48:39
and i i put that right beside where he
48:41
was lying so he could look at it
48:43
and he said i will never forget your act
48:45
of kindness that you gave me god's word
48:48
when i needed it the most and he said i
48:50
am so looking forward to running the
48:52
welcome center
48:55
[Applause]
48:58
and about a week after i went by there i
49:00
was driving down the road and i knew
49:02
where that
49:02
where he was and that beat this
49:04
beautiful hospice place
49:06
and i actually saw him leaving with
49:08
angels being taken up to heaven
49:11
and god said look to the right and he
49:13
said richard's leaving
49:16
because i was obedient he allowed me to
49:18
see him
49:19
leaping and so i was very blessed so i
49:22
started calling people richard richard
49:24
heart just went to heaven
49:26
before anyone else knew he went to
49:28
heaven i just saw him he's leaving
49:29
forever people are used to that for me
49:32
and then they said then they had a head
49:33
on the news because he was well known
49:35
all the city uh we we
49:37
we mourn the passing of richard harter
49:40
to this day such that
49:42
and i want thank you god for letting me
49:43
see that
49:45
so they celebrate from the time they
49:47
step out of that old body
49:49
this body is part of you it's what
49:53
sleeps
49:54
but you your spirit man never sleeps
49:57
even when you're sleeping now
49:59

50:01
spiritual part of you your soul is awake
50:03

50:33
my walls i can walk in my home
50:35
even if it's not on and i hear the music
50:37
that plays all the time that remains in
50:39
the room
50:40
your words remain in your rooms where
50:44
you live
50:45
sometimes i walk in someone's home and
50:47
hear things i don't like
50:50
i'll step outside and i'll pray over
50:52
them and break the enemy
50:54
off at their home images remain in your
50:57
home by stuff you watch

51:04
soul
51:06
your soul doesn't sleep okay you feed it
51:10
24 hours a day
51:13
your body gets fed three times a day
51:15
sometimes five times a day
51:17
in america probably five times or more
51:20
and now you're all eating
51:22

51:29
day right your spirit man god said
51:31

51:43
spirit man
51:44

51:48
or i listen to powerful speakers online
51:50
now we got the internet
51:52
god designed the internet by the way not
51:54
the devil it does not belong to the
51:56
devil amen
51:59
and these words of god coming literally
52:01
some people will have angelic beans come
52:03
out of their computers
52:07

52:14
your computer is a portal your ipad is a
52:16
portal whatever can carry images
52:19
or transmit stuff it can transmit heaven
52:23
or the other place you need to be
52:26
careful what you put on here amen
52:29
i'll be somewhere and i'll see things up
52:30
like i'll see things come right out of
52:32
the tv
52:33
i'm very careful i need to tissue
52:35
somebody
52:37
i'm very careful about what my eyes see
52:41
okay i don't want to put stuff in my
52:43
soul it doesn't belong there
52:44
i'm going to keep it sorry i'm going to
52:47
keep my soul pure
52:49
i want it pure and it's not that hard
52:52
it's a lifestyle
52:57
being like christ should be a lifestyle
52:59
it's not a sunday thing
53:02
although i'm thankful people actually go
53:04
on sunday of course some people can't
53:06
even go on sunday now but i want you
53:07
know california
53:09
is breaking all the rules right now
53:12
california has had it with the lockdowns
53:17
that's right and i noticed he's been
53:20
speaking about america and that's what
53:21
i'm leading up to
53:23
you have to remember what the father
53:25
said
53:26
okay the enemy is not in power right now
53:30
in this country
53:32
it is not god still is trump still
53:35
is he is a president he is the one who's
53:39
in power he is in office
53:41
so when the righteous are in office or
53:44
they're in power
53:45
the people rejoice that's why he's
53:46
telling everybody to eat cake
53:48
amen the worst thing you can do to the
53:51
enemy
53:52
right now is to
53:55
you celebrate like it's already happened
53:57
you know what this scripture says
53:59
call those things that be not as though
54:02
they were
54:03
that means you act like they've already
54:05
happened
54:06
so if you believe victory is coming and
54:09
it is then you should act like it
54:13
he sets a table
54:16
a table is what you eat from
54:20
it's what you celebrate from that's what
54:22
he's saying he's saying that scripture
54:23
even the myth of every one thing around
54:25
you
54:26
he can set a temple of celebration for
54:29
your life
54:30
and it missed everything around you and
54:32
that will begin to combat
54:34
darkness because the enemy sees he's not
54:38
winning hallelujah
54:41
our life gets brighter that he put in us
54:43
when he got born again you got part of
54:45
the light of god put in you
54:47
some people's light would blind the
54:48
enemy some of you can already see it
54:53
when you begin to stand for what is
54:55
right and you don't step back
54:57
that life society begins to blind the
54:59
enemy and he gets
55:00
terrified and i ask the father what else
55:05
can they do they
55:06
prayed they fasted they laid on their
55:08
face
55:09
they've encouraged people and he said
55:11
they can eat cake and celebrate
55:14
[Applause]
55:18
and every time he's called me up to
55:20
heaven guess what they're doing
55:22
they're eating cake
55:26
because they've already seen the victory
55:28
happen
55:29
amen the father's been from the
55:31
beginning to the end in the end of the
55:33
beginning
55:34
and then he'll let you know you were
55:35
there too
55:38
before he made this earth
55:41
and he sent you from himself he had
55:44
already been from the end of the
55:45
beginning the beginning of the end he'd
55:47
already been there you were in him
55:50
when he went there and made things you
55:52
were in him
55:53
living in him you've already been
55:56
yourself
55:57
from the beginning to the end and the
55:58
end to the beginning
56:01
because you're you're eternal beings we
56:04
are eternal
56:06
amen you're born again one day you'll be
56:09
immortal
56:11
immortal means you can't sin you can't
56:13
get sick
56:14
you can't die that's your future
56:18
some of those behind that barbed wire
56:19
will not have that future
56:23
amen so these are great days that we're
56:26
living in
56:28
but the father chose to explain things
56:30
to you
56:31
so it's perfectly clear to you like it
56:34
is to him
56:36
our country has a great future
56:39
because it will impact this world we
56:43
will be we'll we will be
56:45
changers atmosphere changers amen
56:49
we walk into place because of christ in
56:52
us
56:52
the atmosphere will change
56:56
smith wigglesworth used to walk into
56:57
places and people would fall on their
56:59
face begin to cry out to god
57:01
that was a measure the measure he's
57:04
given us now is beyond that original
57:07
measure
57:08
you drive past people's homes and
57:10
they'll in your homes fall
57:12
out under the glory
57:16
people will see your roofs on fire
57:18
because the fire of god in you
57:20
in your home
57:24
people will walk in and out of the walls
57:26
to go speak someplace
57:27
one day i won't come by plane i'll walk
57:30
through the wall and come right out on
57:31
the platform
57:35
these are greater days of glory that
57:36
we're entering into
57:38
and he has to expose the evil and it has
57:42
to be dealt with
57:43
it can't be taken off the earth at this
57:45
time but it will be crushed back
57:49
and we will rule with great authority
57:51
and dominion we were given it by christ
57:54
jesus
57:55
he never let anything stop him in this
57:58
earth
57:59
not even time he was over time
58:03
he would step in the spirit realm and
58:05
walk through the people
58:07
he didn't walk around the people i've
58:09
been to the amount of the precipice i've
58:11
been there
58:12
i was in israel last year
58:16
on the tour that they bushwhacked me
58:17
with because
58:19
no one told me i'd have to be on the bus
58:21
at 8 am
58:22
[Laughter]
58:24
when i laid down at 7 am and no one told
58:28
me as the speaker of this tour to 18
58:31
places in israel i climbed the mountains
58:34
i went down inside of mountains
58:36
i've been to every significant place in
58:38
israel the dimensions in the bible
58:41
and i thought i was going to have a nice
58:42
place to speak in the hotel and
58:44
i do a couple meetings a day and i have
58:46
to go here my husband was laughing the
58:48
whole time and i tell them steve showed
58:50
someone you bushwhacked me
58:53
they hooked a microphone on me and
58:55
recorded everything he said wherever god
58:57
says the prophets i do it
58:59
well he had something to say everywhere
59:00
i went
59:04
where the fire came down before elijah
59:07
i got to speak on the sea of galilee
59:10
they had a fox so thick the boat
59:11
couldn't leave so i
59:12
commanded the fog to lift and it was
59:14
gone in three minutes
59:17
i don't tolerate the weather being over
59:19
me
59:20
it wasn't over christ was it right
59:26
he was not afraid of anything in the
59:27
enemy the enemy would run from him the
59:29
demons would scream when he would be
59:31
around them
59:33
and he walked as a righteous man on this
59:35
earth he chose
59:36
he had to choose with his will he had to
59:38
live just like us
59:40
he was still the son of god but he's
59:42
also called the son of man
59:44
he's appointed with every single thing
59:46
that we're tempted with
59:48
or attacked with and yet he was
59:51
victorious
59:52
in every way in his life why because he
59:55
was setting an example for us
59:58
you can live that way i live that way
60:03
it's different but it's fun
60:06
it's fun to walk holy because you choose
60:08
to be holy people say you can't be holy
60:11
i said the bible says we can
60:14
it says he's coming for a church this is
60:16
one of the reasons why he's not coming
60:17
right now
60:18
should be pretty evident the world
60:22
will know us by our love for
60:26
each other i challenge you to go talk to
60:30
some worldly people and ask them if you
60:31
think the church loves one another
60:35
it says in the bible they will know us
60:38
by our love for each other
60:40
so guess what he's not coming right now
60:42
roll up your rapture rug and stick in
60:43
the closet
60:47
it clearly says the wealth of the wicked
60:50
and they sure have a lot
60:51
that's been pretty evident for everybody
60:54
the wealth of the wicked is laid up for
60:55
the just and the righteous that has not
60:57
been transferred yet are you willing to
60:59
leave without that
61:05
it says even by christ himself the works
61:07
i did you will do how many people do you
61:09
know are walking on water
61:13
raising the dead that stinks they're in
61:15
the grave so long
61:18
making food appear everywhere wherever
61:20
they need it to appear
61:22
stepping in a boat and transporting it
61:24
in time itself
61:26
stepping in the spirit room and walking
61:28
through places
61:32
we need to already be doing that because
61:34
those greater
61:35
works are coming rapidly when you will
61:38
raise the dead of the funeral that was
61:40
cremated
61:42
where you will stop an earthquake that
61:44
started until it to put it back the way
61:46
it was before it came
61:53
where you tell the weather what it can
61:55
and cannot do
62:03
we have to be ready for those things
62:04
because he's not holding them back
62:06
once he does this what he is going to do
62:10
is setting the platform for us he's not
62:13
doing it just to bless the world it is
62:15
for the body of christ
62:17
to step up and be who we were called to
62:19
be you were born here because he wants
62:22
you here
62:24
you're an american you're here to
62:25
represent god himself
62:29
that's why he made america he calls it
62:31
his gift
62:33
his first gift was his son his second
62:36
gift to the world was america
62:40
where people walk in righteousness and
62:43
they have
62:43
liberty and freedom and justice in their
62:46
country
62:47
where they honor and respect him
62:50
and they're not ashamed of who he is
62:56
the moral majority in this country did
62:58
vote on november 3rd
63:00
and they chose justice liberty and
63:03
freedom
63:05
we didn't choose the other stuff that
63:07
the devil tried slipping in
63:10
their lives are not going to be good
63:14
because they chose what was wrong and
63:16
they feed upon people
63:18
and they destroy people they want to
63:20
crush our country
63:21
they want to make it into a third world
63:23
country they
63:25
don't care about anybody's color of
63:28
their skin
63:30
they care about nothing but evil and
63:32
wickedness
63:34
hurting and harming they will use
63:37
anything they can to make their point
63:41
and they will lie every time they do it
63:44
so god is not tolerating what they have
63:48
said will happen
63:50
it will not happen and it will not
63:53
remain
63:54
and it will not be forever it will not
63:56
be very long down the road
63:58
before what he showed me will happen he
64:01
showed me
64:02
when that freedom is announced he showed
64:04
me when they will be
64:06
forced to announce the election was
64:09
[Applause]
64:09
[Music]
64:10
stolen
64:14
for these four years
64:18
he needs to continue what he has started
64:21
god gave him to start in this country i
64:24
think he's going to be a little bit more
64:26
tempered
64:27
having had to see all the evil but i
64:29
promise you he despises evil
64:33
and when god first showed me trump he
64:35
said he is an
64:36
all-american boy who is all for
64:39
america that's how god himself described
64:42
him
64:44
and he has lived that before all of us
64:47
even with
64:48
a hate never and our history our country
64:51
has a president
64:51
been so wrongly accused and hated
64:55
and just people feed on that i mean they
64:58
feed evil feeds on that
65:00
and then when others came in to join
65:02
them and decided to
65:03
collude with them that means it became a
65:05
part of what they were planning
65:07
to block everything we said that was
65:09
truth
65:10
they wouldn't allow they don't want
65:12
people to know the truth they think if
65:13
they can keep the truth from being heard
65:15
that what they want will happen but
65:18
they're wrong about that too
65:21
some networks will be lost they won't
65:24
exist anymore because of the lies
65:27
they conspired to overthrow this country
65:31
anyone who committed conspiracy to
65:33
overthrow the presidency
65:35
or the overseer of the country are going
65:37
to prison
65:39
amen please
65:42
don't hear about already overseas
65:45
they're making arrests for those who
65:46
from other countries leaders of other
65:48
countries
65:49
people in high places in other countries
65:51
have already been arrested
65:55
and i think they're going to get as many
65:56
from there as they can and then they're
65:58
going to it's going to happen here
66:00
you will see you will see justice
66:03
justice will be served amen
66:06
[Applause]
66:10
to miss your destiny nor your future
66:13
amen it's just going to get greater and
66:17
greater in the days to come these are
66:19
not the days
66:20
of great darkness there will not be
66:22
cities burning other than the ones they
66:24
burned
66:25
their south and all those cities that
66:28
have been burned
66:29
people were paid to do that they were
66:32
all hired
66:34
even the people for black lives matter
66:36
antifa they have paid for
66:37
all of that to be done not to help
66:40
anyone
66:41
they're using them they even make
66:44
promises to china
66:46
for things and now people are wanting to
66:48
collect on the promises
66:51
so now some of them behind the barbed
66:52
wire are hiding
66:55
because they can't deliver what they
66:56
thought what they would already have in
66:58
their hand by now they thought we'll
66:59
have civil war
67:00
half the people will be dead we'll just
67:02
go in and collect everything and take
67:04
over
67:04
[Music]
67:05
we're not gonna have civil war we don't
67:08
want civil war
67:09
we have freedom we have our lives we
67:12
love our families
67:14
so they're never going to get us to do
67:15
that amen
67:17
and this is from the father they will
67:19
never get your guns
67:21
there's far too many red lakes in
67:26
america
67:34
he even shocks me sometimes
67:37
with some of the things that he says but
67:40
i have to agree because i know
67:42
some of those run nets
67:46
he said they'll never reach them they'll
67:48
be dead before they can get to them
67:53
one of the reasons why they haven't done
67:55
anything is we can still get them
67:57
because
67:58
we have our arms it's written in our
68:01
papers
68:02
we have the right to bear arms
68:05
is that correct
68:08
we have many freedoms and liberties
68:10
given to us in our constitution they're
68:12
trying to twist everything they can it's
68:14
still not gonna work
68:16
and until god i'm glad you're gonna do
68:17
something quicker
68:19
than later because the rednecks i'm
68:21
gonna wait much longer
68:25
my brother has a hotline to him
68:29
you haven't heard about my brother you
68:31
go back and look at some of those videos
68:32
you hear about him
68:35
he is all for justice he has to make out
68:38
himself he has a hotline from homeland
68:42
security and some other groups that are
68:44
organized
68:46
should they need their help
68:50
their guns are ready
68:53
and trump said there's a reason why i
68:55
said go home
68:56
and go home and stay
69:00
safe you know i will be back
69:04
he's trying to keep us you know not not
69:07
get upset
69:07
or not have fear come in us and the
69:10
other thing god
69:11
promised was he will take the virus off
69:14
the face of the earth
69:21
[Applause]
69:23
[Music]
69:25
devious purposes to bring heart to you
69:28
the social distancing was to keep us
69:31
apart so we wouldn't come together
69:33
although the bible is very clear don't
69:35
forsake the gathering together of
69:36
yourselves
69:38
and so he's against social distancing in
69:40
case you wonder he doesn't like it
69:42
there's no social distancing in heaven
69:44
and there's no mask
69:45
in heaven there's not even handshakes
69:48
choose only hugs
69:52
and i keep telling people we're gonna
69:53
have a mass burning party one day
69:59
i am not ignorant to the fact that there
70:01
are some people who have
70:03
compromised lives already you know they
70:06
have issues
70:07
if they want to wear them let them wear
70:09
them i'm not against them wearing them
70:11
i'm against me being forced to wear one
70:13
when i don't need what i
70:16
[Music]
70:21
and i don't like it every time they say
70:22
the new normal they can have them in
70:25
normal but it's not going to be in this
70:28
country
70:30
safer to apart no we're not safer apart
70:33
right that's never been true we're safer
70:36
together amen
70:38
we're here together we're in this
70:40
together
70:41
and we have a god who has a plan
70:44
he says he hasn't gone on dates everyone
70:46
else pip
70:47
so they've jumped off the wagon
70:51
they're wagging a victory in celebration
70:53
they just think we're just going to give
70:54
it and i'm not rolling over to anybody
70:59
no i'm not giving that up i know god has
71:02
a plan
71:03
and hang in there you're going to be
71:05
really happy
71:06
that you were some of the ones who said
71:08
all along victory is coming
71:10
and everyone will have to eat their
71:11
words
71:13
but they'll still be happy that we're
71:15
free amen
71:18
so you remember jesus who we belong to
71:21
and gave ourselves to
71:23
hold your life in his hand
71:26
no man holds your life in their hand
71:30
he wants us all to be free even the
71:33
bible said god never intended for
71:34
a person to be over us he wasn't all for
71:37
the kings at all
71:38
he didn't appoint kings man wanted a
71:41
king to be
71:42
maybe you didn't know that back in the
71:44
old days
71:45
they demanded to have a king be over
71:47
them
71:48
and so from that point on there's always
71:50
been leaders presidents
71:52
kings those in authority over people
71:55
that's why he said when the righteous
71:57
are in power the people rejoice because
72:00
they have a good one
72:01
when the wicked is they're not going to
72:03
rejoice amen
72:05
we are rejoicing amen
72:10
hallelujah so i won't talk but a few
72:13
minutes more
72:14
because you know i'm you know when i'm
72:16
finally awake which i'm kind of awake
72:19
you don't know but i'm actually sleeping
72:24
it's hard to get up in the morning for
72:26
me that's my that's my night time
72:29
and i tell people it's not the next day
72:30
until i go to sleep and i wake up
72:33
then it's the next day
72:36
my family has mostly adapted to the way
72:39
uh
72:39
my hours are i like that since i was
72:41
little my husband
72:43
used to go to sleep at ten o'clock no
72:44
matter what was going on he can hang in
72:46
there until midnight at least sometimes
72:48
one in the morning
72:49
my mom will hang in there to two or
72:51
three in the morning with me
72:53
she's gonna be 90 next year and she said
72:56
if she had her way she'd be taking a
72:57
plum switch up to that barbed wire
73:00
and be making some changes herself
73:04
[Laughter]
73:08
she's still my mom
73:11
and i'm blessed that she lives with me
73:13
but she definitely has her own opinions
73:15
about things
73:19
and she's not happy with it either but
73:21
she also understands
73:23
and she does pray for people people who
73:26
are seniors in certain situations in
73:28
their life
73:28
she prays all the time for them she
73:31
actually has an anointing for people for
73:33
married couples
73:34
that can't have children she's highly
73:36
anointed if she prays for you i have a
73:38
baby in nine months
73:40
it has happened over and over and over
73:42
usually when she comes to me she has her
73:44
own prayer line
73:47
so she's brought many babies from heaven
73:48
to earth by praying for people releasing
73:51
her anointing
73:52
to to bring them from heaven to earth
73:54
for god
73:55
she still does that she still prays for
73:57
people and it works
73:58
her faith is there she operates i
74:01
operate
74:02
you know in the revelation zone she
74:04
operates in the baby zone
74:08
so i i love what i do i love people i
74:11
can honestly say
74:12
i love you i love you with the father's
74:15
love
74:17
and he does have great plans for us and
74:19
i wish everyone
74:20
could hear these words he cares
74:23
he doesn't like sickness and disease he
74:26
doesn't like
74:27
anger he doesn't like violence he
74:29
doesn't like life being taken from us
74:31
that's nothing he purposed for us
74:35
and so if people don't know jesus christ
74:38
i will encourage anybody
74:39
watching right now that you make sure
74:42
you receive jesus christ as your savior
74:45
it gives you more than just hell
74:47
insurance okay
74:48
it gives you authority dominion it helps
74:51
you to step into the supernatural
74:53
and in these days of greater glory we'll
74:55
see things never seen before on the
74:57
earth with the signs and wonders that
74:58
will be done
75:00
people will be shocked and stunned to
75:02
see really the power of god in
75:04
us because of his son so i look forward
75:08
to seeing you all again
75:10
and i i pray that you have a blessed day
75:16
oh i'm absolutely going to be speaking
75:18
at the inaugural prayer breakfast okay
75:26
i got to pray for him back in 2000 when
75:29
they had the last
75:30
prayer breakfast i actually got to pray
75:32
for him for the vice president for their
75:34
families for the future of america
75:37
and i'm telling you god and don't and
75:39
you reserve your judgment
75:41
for pence okay
75:44
don't judge people when you don't know
75:46
everything
75:48
you don't understand covert activities
75:50
you don't know what's going on
75:52
so reserve your judgment for him okay
75:57
they're very close they really care for
75:59
each other i know people
76:00
in their administration so don't jump on
76:03
something because you see something or
76:05
hear something
76:06
you can't tell everything that's going
76:08
on especially if it's covert it won't be
76:10
covered
76:11
amen so we will see what is decided
76:15
about that what decisions are made
76:17
i do know that god did pick pence for
76:20
eight years also
76:21
like he did the president and i need to
76:23
let you know
76:24
that means if trump won the election
76:26
that means vice president pence
76:28
also won that election amen so we'll see
76:31
what god's going to do
76:33
i do want you to get ready to celebrate
76:35
in your life like you never have before
76:38
eat cake in moderation
76:42
and right now i had already asked them
76:46
if i could teach you a dance
76:50
[Applause]
76:55
if i if i could teach this dance to you
76:57
i'm kind of fine if i
76:59
actually have now i do have
77:03
music can you all play
77:06
everybody dance now can you dance now
77:10
i'm teaching them
77:27
you might have to play that one from
77:29
your phone
77:32
dancing
77:35
[Applause]
77:35
[Music]
77:42
everybody
77:50
i'm trying to stop it first because i
77:52
have to teach it to you first
77:56
because we can play it up here through
77:57
this pa system my husband's brother
78:10
now we're going to okay this first if
78:12
you go why do you do this because it's
78:14
heaven culture okay
78:16
uh church is supposed to be fun amen
78:20
it is god in heaven but when i started
78:23
speaking not only did i have to show up
78:25
with my pink hair which freaked out a
78:27
lot of pastors
78:28
i don't know why i thought you know and
78:30
i even knew like 40 some pastors in mine
78:32
was sitting they said
78:33
you've gone too far you fell off the
78:35
edge so now we can't work with you
78:43
it's just while some people will look
78:45
and go know that you don't qualify
78:47
anymore
78:48
well you know the holy spirit already
78:50
warned me
78:51
and he i actually saw angels doing this
78:53
dance that we're going to learn
78:55
in my own church we had a prophet
78:58
several prophets coming at a panel they
79:00
did a q a session
79:01
and all their angels were standing
79:03
behind them on the platform because i
79:05
see the angels
79:06
see all of yours by the way they're
79:07
excited because they you're going to do
79:09
this famous
79:10
they're going to be doing this dance
79:11
with you okay and so i saw them doing
79:14
this dance and i'm like well that's wow
79:16
that looks like
79:16
fun what was that the holy spirit said
79:19
they're doing the revelation dance
79:20
because the people have received
79:22
revelation this day and they're excited
79:25
and then i went to canada about two
79:26
weeks later and i was speaking with
79:28
people there we had four hour meetings
79:30
they would break for lunch and we'd come
79:32
back i said boy they did it
79:34
and and in the second meeting the
79:36
hospital said you're going to teach them
79:37
all that dance
79:40
what dance the humor in all this is
79:43
all three of my daughters their gift is
79:46
dance
79:48
they do ballet do all the traditional
79:50
beautiful stuff they're anointed people
79:52
been raised from the dead when they
79:54
dance they've been healed when they
79:55
dance
79:56
it is who they are and i don't dance at
80:00
all
80:00
i've been kicked out of jazzercise
80:02
classes okay
80:04
and now he's telling me all my daughters
80:06
laugh hysterically every time i talk
80:07
about it you have to teach them you're
80:09
teaching everyone in there this dance
80:11
because we want them to celebrate
80:13
they're going to learn to celebrate when
80:14
they receive revelation they need to
80:16
celebrate
80:17
and so i did and i think the only song i
80:19
at that time knew about was when the
80:21
saints come marching in
80:23
so i talked to him and so when i get
80:25
back to
80:26
where i live um i heard this music
80:30
and the holy spirit said that's the
80:32
music we want you to learn to teach it
80:33
to
80:34
them and that's that's that's a secular
80:36
song
80:38
he said yes but we like that song
80:42
we want everyone to tell us they're
80:43
going to dance when they get to heaven
80:45
they may as well practice now
80:47
and so ever since then i have taught
80:49
this dance to that song
80:51
and does anybody here know that dance
80:53
anyone
80:55
i know you do you really come up here if
80:58
anyone has done the students before
81:00
you can come up here a couple of you
81:01
come up here
81:26
everything on camera is going to be
81:28
doing this dance too
81:29
they will jump in and do it a lot of
81:31
them already know it it's actually
81:33
caught the revelation names but for some
81:35
reason
81:35
because i talked to my angels everybody
81:37
calls it if you google angel dance
81:39
it will bring up congregations all over
81:41
the world doing this dance
81:44
and so it's it has three movements
81:48
that's all i'll tell you what they each
81:50
mean and then i'll show you with you
81:52
the first one is that um i'm receiving
81:55
revelation it's treasure so i'm digging
81:57
up treasure
82:00
that's that's the first movement the
82:02
second one is i'm
82:03
celebrating the revelation
82:10
the third one is i'm gonna share it
82:12
everywhere
82:14
[Applause]
82:16
and i didn't know anything about counts
82:18
or beats or nothing okay i can't even
82:20
play a tina marine i was going off the
82:22
stage
82:25
that is not my gift i can't even keep me
82:27
to that
82:28
and so someone uh the holy spirit said
82:31
you gotta do to account
82:32
eight and i'm like
82:35
i was coming and then this angel appears
82:37
again when i wake up in the morning
82:39
which is noon this angel appears to me
82:42
in my room and he goes
82:43
watch i don't know if he was happy with
82:45
the assignment or not
82:48

82:49
thing and he was speaking he said wow

82:54

82:56
of eight
82:58

87:06
[Applause]
87:16
oh
87:31
i can tell you uh probably my hardest
87:34
group to teach
87:36
was a group of 80 baptist
87:39
ministers
87:42
[Applause]
87:44
god doesn't cut any i was invited in
87:47
canada they had a monthly prayer meeting
87:50
unit for like 15 years right they'd have
87:53
a guest speaker well they didn't tell
87:55
anybody
87:55
i was going to be there so when we got
87:58
there margaret and i sat at this table
87:59
we could see
88:00
eyes piercing us right who's this woman
88:04
with pink hair
88:07
i'm like margaret i think they got tired
88:09
feather
88:11
feathering in their mind and this little
88:13
guy gets up
88:14
and they all knew him because there was
88:18
a few catholics there there were a few
88:20
presbyterians a few but mostly
88:23
retired practice winners not even like
88:26
new young ones and by the time i got up
88:30
and i
88:31
introduced myself and and the guy played
88:34
his little accordion for worship
88:36
that wasn't enough to burn my flesh
88:49
all their angels were behind them
88:51
laughing so hard they could hardly stand
88:54
up
88:55
and so i said i was here to share heaven
88:58
they got to call me up in heaven
88:59
and they were like this
89:03
there was not one bit of emotion on
89:05
their faces they were so angry at the
89:08
the guy who was the head of the
89:09
breakfast and i said i'm just going to
89:11
press him
89:14
and i started talking about what it was
89:16
like to stand before the son of god
89:18
and of course in their mind i could read
89:20
it no one can stand see the face of god
89:22
then die
89:22
they would die i mean that's what was in
89:24
their minds and then about
89:26
five minutes in they started to cry
89:30
i saw tears coming down their eyes and
89:33
then across their arms
89:35
and they sat there they were so undone
89:38
by the love of god
89:40
and explaining what it was like to see
89:42
before him
89:43
and the ways of consuming passion that
89:45
came from him
89:46
and how you well he welcomed you home to
89:48
heaven as his son and daughter
89:50
no one cared in that room that i was a
89:53
woman
89:54
nobody cared i had pink hair they began
89:57
to shake
89:58
visibly shake sitting in their seats
90:00
because of the presence of the holy
90:02
spirit
90:02
they didn't even know they didn't know
90:04
how to respond they didn't know what to
90:05
do all they could do was shake
90:07
and then when we got vienna said now i'm
90:10
going to teach you something they do in
90:11
heaven by that time
90:13
they didn't care what i said i said so
90:15
heaven does this dance
90:17
angels do the same uh
90:20
revelation about heaven and about the
90:23
father and about his son
90:25
they do this dance would you all like to
90:27
learn this dance and they yelled at the
90:28
top of their lungs
90:29
yes
90:33
and we had our little computer with us
90:35
and we were going to plug it in to get
90:36
the music
90:37
that music and i said when we do it to
90:40
this music you may not understand but we
90:42
have to do
90:42
everybody dance now because you know
90:44
they don't dance in church they don't
90:46
raise hands in church
90:47
and i'll tell you before we were done
90:48
they were dancing raising their hands
90:52
and we couldn't get our music converted
90:54
so the little guy said well i can play
90:56
you know uh when the saints come
90:59
marching in
91:00
on my little thing
91:11
got up and learned that dance and they
91:13
were laughing and they were crying in
91:15
her hands
91:16
okay in the beginning when he did his
91:18
little recording thing he was saying
91:19
it's okay to raise your hand god won't
91:21
strike you down
91:22
and none of them raised their hand they
91:24
were all like
91:27
they were doing the whole thing the best
91:29
part was they were going to have a
91:31
second meeting
91:34
and they called all their friends you
91:37
have to come this person didn't say lady
91:40
this person has been the handwritten
91:42
talked about the throne of god
91:43
there was twice as many pastors in that
91:46
room
91:47
it was like there were 200 glasses in
91:50
that room and the animals couldn't
91:52
wait until i said now we're going to
91:55
learn a dance
91:58
it was life changing life changing for
92:01
all of them so
92:03
if they can do it you
92:06
can do it amen and we did that all over
92:09
america wherever i traveled in the world
92:12
everybody learned that dance and we know
92:15
some pastors that had it taken on
92:16
purpose
92:17
and they welcome people to the church
92:19
then they play the dance on the screen
92:21
and everybody gets up they either want
92:23
to stay or they want to leave
92:26
but heaven is like that they celebrate
92:28
all the time
92:30
you know and people love their life
92:32
there
92:33
they can't wait for you to get there
92:35
they make plans for you
92:36
they get these little things to actually
92:38
record places
92:40
that they go that they can keep that
92:42
they know you will love specifically to
92:44
go and see in heaven
92:45
so you're going to be really busy when
92:47
you get there amen
92:49
so the other thing i want to do is lay
92:52
hands on every person here
92:54
amen and i'm going to give out
92:56
importations to everybody
92:58
amen if you want it i promise you that
93:02
i'm
93:02
healthy and whole
93:06
but you know it says that that you get
93:08
implications by the laying on of hands
93:10
is that right
93:12
so i'm not going to mock laying my hand
93:14
on you i'm actually going to put my hand
93:15
on you right here
93:17
i'm going to release the love of god
93:22
so the way i usually do this is we get a
93:24
line going and you walk
93:26
i'll like i'll stand here and that line
93:28
will form all the way around
93:30
and you come up to me and i'm just going
93:32
to say come here honey
93:35
are you just come up here and i'll go i
93:37
i impart the
93:38
love of god into you and it will go from
93:41
here because i operate in it it'll go
93:44
here into your heart
93:45
okay and you'll begin to feel his
93:47
presence
93:48
in you so and remember whatever it is
93:51
you need from him because this is from
93:53
him
93:54
you can ask for if you need healing if
93:57
you need finances
93:58
if you need you know things in your mind
94:01
restored whatever it is you can ask me
94:03
for it at that moment okay
94:05
so oh and make sure you say i receive it
94:08
okay everybody practice i receive it
94:11
and that's you saying yes that you do
94:13
accept that so
94:15
remember you have not because you asked
94:16
not so by coming being willing to come
94:19
up here
94:19
you're saying you're going to have it
94:22
amen
94:23
so we need to get that line somebody
94:25
needs to get that line
94:27
going maybe i think we usually start
94:29
where we start from the back or the
94:31
front i don't remember
94:33
yeah so i think the last the last row
94:37
come around here and just get in line
94:39
right here and as you receive it just go
94:41
back and sit down
94:42
this doesn't take very long because i'm
94:46
not going to go to every person and take
94:48
hours to do that okay this is an
94:50
accelerate
94:51
accelerated way to receive we're
94:54
entering into accelerated days so
94:56
it won't take very long to do that all
94:58
right
95:02
that's what i was thinking

00:00
[Applause]
00:07
if you see me making hand motions i'm
00:09
copying the angels in the room
00:13
they never are stagnant
00:17
they're always moving they're always
00:19
moving and so they really loved
00:22
anything that worships the lord
00:26
every time they go wild leaving in the
00:29
throne room when
00:29
when you're worshiping or adoring jesus
00:32
christ
00:33
just for a while but a lot of them they
00:35
were going like this well most of them
00:36
were going like this
00:40
except the ones behind her one behind
00:43
her was going
00:47
so i have to call you when i'm watching
00:49
it's hard not to do it
00:51
the throne room is a powerful powerful
00:54
place
00:55
it is so amazing to have been there and
00:58
the seraphim when the seraphim starts
01:00
singing
01:00
they come out of the glory cloud over
01:02
the throne and their hair is on fire
01:04
it's like blue fire
01:05
and they sing and they sing and they
01:07
sing and they sing
01:09
i keep inviting them to come so if they
01:11
ever showed them though your hair
01:12
probably turned blue and catch on fire
01:17
there's some of the fire carriers in the
01:19
throne room but to be there on purpose
01:21
there's nothing like
01:23
no one is up there crying that they
01:27
died as hard as that might seem to you
01:31
to imagine
01:32
they're not no one's crying no one is
01:36
sad
01:37
no one is grieving no one remembers
01:40
anything
01:41
bad that rhyme that wasn't me his holy
01:43
spirit
01:45
they they don't they're so in the glory
01:48
really and that thing about for all of
01:52
sin that comes short of the glory of god
01:54
it's not about you committing sins
01:56
i hear that you know if they don't have
01:57
revelation they don't understand what
01:59
that means
02:00
that means you you should be carrying
02:03
the glory
02:04
you should be carrying the glory you
02:05
should be carrying it for him releasing
02:07
it for him
02:08
it comes out of you like shockwaves
02:09
begin to permeate
02:11
everything it touches every person every
02:13
place
02:14
we we we don't do that we don't know how
02:16
to do that
02:17
it's something we'll do now in this time
02:21
you are in one of the most important
02:24
times on the face of the earth one of
02:26
the most blessed times regardless of
02:28
what your i see your ears here no
02:31
you were chosen from the beginning of
02:33
time to be here you were meant to be
02:35
here
02:38
all of your family members are so
02:40
excited you're here
02:41
amen you're not looking at the mass
02:44
you're not looking at the virus which is
02:46
you know
02:46
pretty much gonna be taken off the face
02:48
of the earth by god
02:51
it's being used against everybody it
02:53
really is
02:54
i'm not saying it's not there i'm not
02:56
saying it hasn't touched some people
02:58
but it's nothing like what they're
03:00
saying it is
03:01
you need to know the truth i bring the
03:05
truth i have to speak the truth okay
03:08
all of this that you're living in now
03:10
will be like
03:11
dust in a very short time
03:22
acceleration in this world
03:26
and not just america this whole thing is
03:28
yes
03:29
it's here we know it's here uh we we
03:31
talk about it we share what do we do
03:33
but let me tell you it's worldwide what
03:35
god is going to do
03:38
he he is planning and his plan will take
03:42
place
03:43
it will say it will say god's will
03:47
god's way not man's way
03:51
not the enemy's way it will be god's way
04:00
this country will be known by the glory
04:03
of god
04:04
the presence of god
04:10
and he's setting it up
04:13
you yes to understand there's covert
04:15
operations in heaven
04:16
and there's covert operations on earth
04:20
and maybe you don't know all that but
04:21
yes things are happening you cannot see
04:24
but you will see them suddenly say
04:26
suddenly
04:28
it will all be known say everything will
04:31
be known
04:34
all the stuff about the elections will
04:36
be known
04:43
[Applause]
04:53
and we will celebrate
04:56
[Applause]
05:04
and i know wonderful people talk about
05:06
revivals
05:08
a lot of people talk about moves of god
05:11
a revival is kind of i don't want to say
05:13
stagnant
05:14
but it's kind of centralized in certain
05:16
places what's coming isn't going to be
05:18
centralized
05:21
moves of god will come together to
05:23
create one
05:25
thing and that is called a habitation
05:29
say habitation is what is coming
05:34
it can't be controlled it can't be
05:37
stopped
05:39
and it can't be changed it's coming from
05:43
heaven
05:45
and we will be the habitation
05:50
no one can move us or take
05:53
us from the place god puts us
05:59
so no matter how people are putting it
06:01
what really is coming is a habitation of
06:03
god
06:04
yes that has never happened before on
06:08
the face of the earth
06:09
and you will not just get delivered
06:12
you'll get to share it you get to
06:13
experience it you get to carry it say
06:15
carry it
06:17
say the knowledge of the glory
06:20
will happen because we
06:24
will carry that glory all over this
06:27
world
06:30
so don't think of yourself of being left
06:32
out okay
06:33
that's not possible say if i'm alive
06:37
and breathing i'm part of it
06:44
that's how it's gonna be this time amen
06:46
amen say for
06:48
generations step out of your box and
06:52
just say it for generations
06:55
until god is done the boy will grow and
06:59
build
07:00
and cover the whole earth like the
07:03
waters cover the sea
07:06
the world will know there is a god
07:11
and they better decide amen
07:18
the other thing that i know is truth we
07:20
can all say this together
07:23
nothing that was done
07:26
through cheating stealing
07:30
lying unjust
07:34
accusations will not escape
07:38
being brought to justice
07:44
[Applause]
07:51
and let me tell you the god side knows a
07:54
whole lot that's been going on that
07:55
maybe you don't know
07:57
and i am talking about trump
08:01
that's okay if you're not okay come
08:03
outside we'll get you saved
08:09
and you know the person who likes him
08:12
the least is the devil
08:15
truly the one who's most terrified of
08:18
him of trump
08:19
is the devil say the devil doesn't like
08:22
him
08:23
maybe i should
08:28
one of the few presidents who has said
08:30
to the people i'm here to give your
08:31
country back to you
08:33
and i'm here to welcome jesus back into
08:35
the white house
08:41
he wasn't always perfect everyone knows
08:43
that especially the fake news but
08:45
they're stuck
08:46
on it they all they do is hit replay
08:51
and i've traveled all over the world
08:53
when all that stuff started people were
08:54
what's wrong with your news i want
08:56
nothing not my news
08:59
and not my news by the way you'd be
09:01
better off not listening
09:03
to anybody okay they know that they can
09:06
brainwash you they know that they can
09:08
compromise your soul to believe
09:10
exactly what they're saying and that's
09:12
why they keep
09:14
saying it if you've never heard things
09:16
about people that have gotten
09:18
brainwashed
09:18
that's how they do it they get you in a
09:22
place
09:23
so you will believe what they're saying
09:24
then they'll say it over and over and
09:27
over and guess what's going to come out
09:28
of your soul
09:29
say as a man thinketh in his heart
09:32
that's his soul so is he
09:36
that's what's happened to all of them
09:39
their souls have been compromised
09:41
they know it okay the darkness knows it
09:44
all the others who are part of all that
09:46
mess they all know that
09:48
and that's why they keep it going that's
09:50
why they don't want the truth to be
09:52
known
09:54
that's why they don't want us saying
09:55
anything that's why they block you or be
09:58
in you whatever they're doing
09:59
they're so terrified that people will
10:03
hear the truth and begin to believe it
10:06
they don't want them i know i know i
10:08
have i have really close friends
10:10
who just did that they fed on it they're
10:12
not the same people
10:14
they're not the same people that's why
10:15
every now and then anyway free soul
10:17
checkup
10:18
and i offer help to all those out there
10:20
who have been compromised
10:23
lose it from your soul
10:26
and i'm really serious about that he
10:28
made us that we can
10:29
loose things remember the keys of the
10:32
kingdom what you loose on earth
10:34
will be loose from heaven what you bind
10:36
on earth
10:37
can be bound on him loose all the bad
10:40
all the negative
10:41
all the hurt trauma tragedies
10:44
all of the fear all the fake news every
10:47
word you've ever heard lose it all from
10:48
your soul
10:49
heaven will come down and pull it out
10:52
and they really do that they will do
10:54
that i've seen people change in three
10:56
minutes from doing that
10:58
then then you bind the things of god i
11:00
choose my will to find the life of god
11:03
the love of god the presence of god his
11:05
will
11:06
his way his word i find the truth to my
11:09
soul
11:10
and there is no one on the earth that
11:12
can take it out of you
11:14
that's what they need to heal the world
11:17
actually needs a soul checkup right
11:20
so it's not that hard to be free
11:24
it's not number one you have to know
11:26
that you're not
11:28
you need to know when you've been
11:29
deceived because the devil for eons and
11:32
ages always use fear as his number one
11:34
weapon
11:34
now it's deception
11:38
it really is because when you say yes to
11:40
deception you're deceived
11:42
and when you're deceived you can't see
11:43
the truth understand the truth
11:45
or even want to know the truth so
11:49
this whole country and other people all
11:51
over the world
11:52
i always do those soul checkups if you
11:54
hear me doing it that's why i'm doing it
11:55
i want them to be free
11:56
right that's right and after the first
11:58
election i offered it free to all the
12:00
democrats
12:03
a post-election therapy i called it
12:08
to have your soul set free
12:11
and a lot of people did it and i have
12:13
that a lot of people call me contact let
12:14
me
12:15
play says hey i did that i'm free
12:19
we will get some new networks i promise
12:21
you the truth is
12:23
some of them will close and be shut down
12:25
we'll keep on with the truth okay
12:27
from the justice that's coming some of
12:30
them will lose their network
12:33
and you don't even know this but some
12:34
ceos have already started stepping down
12:38
the thing about deception is when you
12:40
aren't deceived and you willingly
12:42
knowingly
12:43
do what's wrong and you know commit
12:45
crime you're
12:46
quite aware that it just might not work
12:49
yeah
12:50
so this whole thing that they're doing
12:52
when they see isn't working
12:54
they just put more barbed wire around
12:56
them
12:59
he's not god they can't stop god
13:02
i'm not going to stop god
13:06
so i also knew this that when these
13:08
things the landslide
13:10
starts can't stop it that's called
13:12
justice amen
13:14
a lot of them will try to run some may
13:16
end their life
13:17
we need to pray for those people because
13:19
they don't want
13:20
they don't want what that word was
13:21
saying up there about the shame they
13:23
didn't want
13:23
people to know what they were doing but
13:25
everyone's going to know what everybody
13:27
was doing because it's already been
13:28
collected
13:29
amen and so they they have proof all the
13:33
proof they need
13:34
and i will just mention this for those
13:36
who don't know this is a truth
13:38
meeting how about that this is the truth
13:41
the truth is that they've already been
13:43
uh tried
13:45
in a different kind of a court and been
13:47
found um guilty
13:50
and uh in case you didn't know uh trump
13:52
is actually a president i just say that
13:58
he did win he wants anyone
14:02
they tried to steal it it's not going to
14:06
work
14:07
[Music]
14:08
and the crazy thing in all this is
14:10
they're trying they
14:11
when i say they i mean the left delivers
14:13
whatever you want to call them they
14:15
god calls me villains i'll just say what
14:16
he does the villains
14:18
we're hoping we would just give up and
14:20
do what they wanted
14:22
they forgot one thing we
14:25
we the people do not
14:29
a third world country where we are in
14:32
control
14:34
say we are free and we're staying free
14:37
man that made a big mistake and one
14:42
thing he didn't consider
14:44
that we wouldn't don't all dumb goblin
14:46
has happened
14:47
no they're not smart because we run
14:49
closer to him
14:52
we get closer to him we hear him clear
14:54
we become more dangerous against hell
14:57
that's what happens when you press on
15:00
god's people that's exactly what
15:01
happened so
15:02
mistake number one was that you thought
15:04
everybody would just dump god and give
15:06
him up
15:08
they don't know us say they don't know
15:09
us
15:11
they're about to find out amen
15:13
[Music]
15:14
so that was their first mistake the
15:15
second mistake is we're already free
15:18
we live free say we're free right now
15:22
we aren't bound get anything to villains
15:26
has written down his new laws
15:30
and i have to say this to you because
15:32
the father said this to him he said tell
15:33
them this please
15:34
it says when the righteous are in power
15:36
the people rejoice so why don't you
15:38
rejoice
15:41
because the truth is the humans
15:44
have no power they are not in power say
15:47
the villains
15:49
are not in power the righteous are in
15:52
power
15:53
so we're going to keep rejoicing while
15:56
they remove the others
16:01
the best show on earth jesus christ
16:03
wiping out hell
16:09
these are going to be glorious days and
16:11
i am so excited to be here
16:13
okay i got born again i i came out born
16:16
again i think
16:17
i do remember at age four receiving
16:19
christ and because i'm a senior i saw
16:20
him step inside of me
16:23
you can't tell a child is four years old
16:25
that he's not real and that doesn't
16:26
really happen
16:28
you're really more open to it than most
16:29
people when they get older it's a little
16:31
bit harder because your mind gets in the
16:32
way
16:35
i saw him step inside of me i liked it
16:37
so much when i turned five for my
16:38
birthday i did it all over again
16:41
this is how precious jesus he stepped
16:43
out to step back in
16:45
[Music]
16:47
for a birthday present
16:51
so living life with heaven all the time
16:53
is definitely different
16:54
i tell people all the time i'm i'm like
16:56
an eight-year-old if you pick on me
16:58
you're picking on nate road they forget
17:00
it really soon right
17:02
they see a pretty flower a crawling bug
17:04
or a piece of cake and they forget it
17:08
so he really did i i worked with ceos
17:11
most of the time i was
17:12
i love business i'm a business person
17:14
actually i'm a ceo hey
17:16
this is how we dress when you get in
17:18
here and having your ceo right
17:20
they're the best apparel ever you don't
17:23
get a nightgown in the bathrobe and
17:25
having people i hope you didn't
17:31
not for the one who owns everything
17:35
he's not going to give you that that's
17:37
not what people wear up there
17:38
you have an apparel wardrobe room it's
17:41
like a thousand square feet maybe more
17:43
than that
17:44
and every kind of beautiful amazing
17:46
thing because there's so many things to
17:48
do in heaven you can't ride a roller
17:50
coaster in a gown
17:53
in case you wonder i wouldn't try it
17:58
for so long i grew up in the church
18:01
trust me from the day i was born i was
18:03
in church
18:04
and i was there for every revival every
18:07
special visitor it didn't matter if it
18:08
lasted six weeks i was there every night
18:10
for six weeks along with all my siblings
18:13
and my parents would space the older
18:15
ones in between the younger ones you
18:16
know when you got 15
18:18
i mean several people i was i was an
18:20
adult at age eight
18:21
that's why he kept me video see i earned
18:23
it
18:24
because from that age i had to help take
18:26
care of my 12 of my siblings
18:29
everyone was a chief okay they were all
18:32
in charge
18:33
all highly anointed uh you know they
18:36
they needed to be tempered a whole lot
18:40
they practiced on me
18:45
and from a very young age i could see in
18:47
the spirit room i understood it
18:49
being the father son holy spirit i
18:51
remember when i invited the holy spirit
18:53
he came
18:53
inside me like a whirlwind and he's been
18:56
there ever since and i can tell you how
18:57
that happens
18:58
who wants to know how he can be
19:00
everywhere at the same time anybody want
19:01
to know
19:03
he has unlimited layers of himself
19:07
one of the key words in heaven is layers
19:10
there's layers of everything layers of
19:13
space
19:14
you can have like 10 places on your
19:16
space your one mansion's on
19:19
and it's hard to explain except when
19:20
they teach me how to say it
19:22
you can see it and so on your mansion
19:25
let's say you have a city
19:26
i've seen some people's mansions the
19:28
size of new york city so maybe you
19:30
better expand
19:31
your thinking say expand that
19:38
and on your management property there
19:39
are these doors suspended just above the
19:41
ground
19:42
a beautiful door different colors
19:44
different doors
19:45
like around your or your whole property
19:47
where your actual mansion is sitting on
19:49
whether it's in the middle of the
19:51
crystal sea under the crystal sea on top
19:53
of the mountain spices in the valley of
19:54
the falls
19:55
uh wherever it is that he puts it uh
19:58
on that property will be doors and if if
20:01
you
20:02
open the door you can see the other
20:04
space that yours
20:06
with places in there that are yours
20:09
you can walk around the door like i
20:11
could walk around this this is how
20:12
there's no limit to space in heaven
20:15
here's the door let's pretend this is
20:17
the door
20:18
you can walk around the door you see the
20:20
door right you see it
20:21
you can walk around it's just this but
20:24
if you open
20:25
the door you step into another whole
20:28
area that belongs to you
20:30
that could be in the valley of the falls
20:32
the mansion out here is maybe on the
20:34
beach of the crystal sea
20:35
or the mountain spices so you get many
20:38
he said
20:39
what do you say i go to repair a place
20:42
for you
20:44
in my father's house
20:48
a world not a flat place in the sky
20:54
are many mansions
20:57
i go there to prepare a place for you
21:02
so he's not going to tell you any more
21:03
than that
21:05
oh until you get there and then you find
21:09
out
21:10
really how magnificent and amazing he is
21:17
there's so many things adventure
21:19
excitement intensity
21:21
a joy humor all of that is in heaven
21:24
that's why we have it here say it was
21:28
there first
21:30
it trickled down to here
21:34
they have mountains they have valleys
21:36
they have oceans you can ride a 200 foot
21:38
wave and
21:38
not die when you crash off of your board
21:40
because you haven't done enough times up
21:42
there
21:44
the waves can change direction while
21:46
you're on them okay they can open
21:47
up they can swing you back and forth
21:52
is heaven
21:55
it says eyes have not seen your ear
21:57
heard or entered in the heart or mind of
21:58
man
21:59
but he has prepared for you except
22:02
and unless is revealed by the spirit of
22:05
god i stand
22:06
on that scripture for every time they've
22:08
taken me every time they've shown me i
22:10
can stand on
22:11
that because of that i can see
22:15
i can know and i can't understand
22:18
and that's my commission my commission
22:21
is to reveal heaven to this earth
22:23
that's why i go all the time non-stop
22:25
they have not stopped since
22:27
1996 taking me
22:30
i used to try to count gave that up
22:33
pretty soon
22:35
and guess what when does he do it
22:37
whenever he wants to
22:39
why i gave him permission you have my
22:42
permission to do with me whatever you
22:43
want if you ever said that you better
22:44
watch out
22:45
because these are the days of the
22:47
glorious signs and wonders that
22:49
manifested signs
22:51
with through the daughters and sons of
22:52
god on the earth
22:54
those aren't other beings who are going
22:56
to come here and have it
22:58
yes you say it's us
23:02
we're your sons and daughters
23:05
we'll manifest and demonstrate
23:12
[Applause]
23:18
hearing things and uh seeing things you
23:20
never saw before
23:22
and don't worry when he tells you you're
23:25
going to hear him
23:26
how does he do that uh step up and do
23:29
that
23:30
step out go up to the front of the
23:32
funeral and raise the dead that was
23:34
cremated
23:37
[Music]
23:38
[Applause]
23:48
that happened a few times maybe facebook
23:51
won't block it
23:55
that's probably going to be replaced
23:56
also by the way
23:59
yeah they'll just be replaced
24:03
and you know they didn't really do all
24:04
that until guess who started running for
24:06
office
24:08
because he's a threat
24:11
he said you can't be bought talk about
24:12
trump again i don't mind insane
24:14
it can't be bought can't be controlled
24:17
they can't make him afraid
24:18
and he already knows the truth
24:21
so they can't convince him to lie they
24:24
can't even deceive him
24:25
he knew all of them before this started
24:27
happening
24:29
because the wealthy and the rich are
24:30
invited to everybody's inner circle
24:32
whether the good or not they know
24:34
he knew the corruption that's why he was
24:36
willing to do it
24:38
we don't know what they're lying out of
24:40
their teeth i know what they're doing i
24:41
know all the stuff they're involved in
24:42
no hey
24:43
yes i will run
24:46
and they were afraid from the day he
24:48
said that they tried everything we could
24:50
of 17 people trying to get that spot on
24:52
the republican ticket
24:54
and god told me i will eliminate them
24:56
one by one
24:58
by one and they will be forced to put
25:00
him there
25:01
guess what happened they were forced to
25:03
put him there
25:06
amen
25:09
i know even even through history there's
25:11
always been people that nobody else
25:12
would have picked but god
25:16
and some of them were very colorful
25:20
yeah but if anybody ever heard all the
25:23
stuff that was said against him
25:24
they would think he wasn't worth
25:26
anything and yet right now he's very
25:27
valuable to god
25:29
if anybody likes it or not he will be
25:31
leading all this stuff that's going to
25:33
be happening
25:35
and while we've been out here some
25:36
people not maybe y'all
25:38
people are afraid not knowing what their
25:39
life is going to be like how's
25:41
everything what about all these horrible
25:42
things being made from the
25:44
villains laugh
25:49
that's what heaven is doing about it
25:55
there probably was never anything on the
25:56
papers just so you know that
25:59
they didn't waste the time to do it they
26:01
whatever they can get away with the food
26:03
people they're doing this is to say this
26:04
is truth
26:08
we just can't be deceived amen
26:11
and most of people i've talked to i
26:12
start to start a conversation
26:14
anywhere in the airport the grocery
26:16
store i don't care where it is so what
26:18
did you think about the elections
26:21
see i used to say
26:24
hey i voted for trump
26:30
90 of everyone i talked to by the way
26:32
you voted for trump yeah
26:34
they did and the ones that didn't don't
26:37
even know what the other ones are doing
26:38
up there right now i confronted one of
26:40
those the other day in my own yard
26:44
yeah my husband hired him to mow front
26:46
yard and came to the back he should have
26:47
never done that
26:49
i was about there i was back there
26:53
because
26:53
we released a home from friends of ours
26:55
who were pastors in new york so
26:57
uh the guy was replacing the little
26:59
fertilizer fertilizer see i can't even
27:01
think that what are they called where's
27:03
my husband
27:05
where are they putting the ground those
27:06
tubes to kill the bugs that come in to
27:08
eat your house up
27:09
terminator
27:12
see my natural brain don't ask me a
27:15
question
27:17
heaven spirit round future past you know
27:20
anything about
27:21
god father son holy spirit the 12
27:24
you know what are they the 12
27:28
the 24 elders know i know all of them
27:32
already
27:35
oh the seven spirits of god aren't just
27:37
his attributes
27:38
those are seven spiritual beings in case
27:40
you wonder
27:41
oh yeah they are actually seven smooth
27:44
the wednesdays so they're seven
27:46
spiritual beings
27:48
it's one of the images they use god
27:50
sends them on special assignments
27:54
i laugh when you hear cloak and dagger
27:55
that's usually about you know murder
27:57
mysteries but
27:58
actually holy spirit wears a club all
27:59
the time he loves to
28:01
he wears one the seven spirits of god
28:03
wear them that came from heaven that's
28:05
not a hell thing
28:07
hell stole too many things okay
28:10
say house deals because they can't
28:13
create something new
28:18
and so anyway so i was back there with a
28:20
guy replacing those termite tubes
28:22
and i said the same thing hey so uh he's
28:24
up say he's a millennial too
28:26
i said so what did you think about the
28:28
elections i think they were stolen
28:30
yes they were still on the
28:33
lousy themselves
28:36
they're all villains i want you to say
28:38
what god calls them
28:40
and then comes around the corner the
28:42
other guy
28:45
so what do you think about the elections
28:47
oh i think i am so glad they got someone
28:49
in there the other one was such a rotten
28:50
lousy guy
28:51
oh you're talking about fighting right
28:54
might as well say his name
28:55
yeah now i'm talking about something so
28:57
oh no no no no he is the good
28:59
guy do you know what the other ones are
29:02
doing
29:02
do you even know what they're doing well
29:04
i know they're doing good things for
29:05
this country but
29:07
you cannot watch one single thing that
29:09
they said they're doing
29:12
and you don't know that they want to let
29:15
all the terrorists in the world
29:16
here with no pulse bar
29:19
did you know they want to break down the
29:20
law so all those human trafficking
29:22
people can come through and just gather
29:23
more
29:24
to take out and and you obviously don't
29:27
know that they're going to wipe out
29:28
church completely because they don't
29:29
want god here
29:31
and this guy guy had already said to me
29:33
god bless you well
29:34
that's who you believe then you don't
29:36
need to know those people up there
29:39
because god's not blessing now he's
29:42
going to remove them
29:43
oh i don't think that let's just end
29:45
this really quick conversation
29:47
i would tell you they have all the
29:49
evidence if they had no no i'm not
29:50
talking about
29:51
civil civil evidence i'm talking about
29:53
military tribunal
29:55
evidence i'm talking videos i'm talking
29:58
testimonies i'm talking things that have
29:59
been taped that you would be so
30:00
horrified to find out what they actually
30:02
have been doing
30:03
even before they started their what they
30:05
knew who they connected to what they've
30:07
been doing all around this world
30:08
it's already there it's there and they
30:11
have it
30:12
these guys who are in there now faking
30:16
who they think they are they will be
30:17
wiped out and god will say exactly who
30:19
our president
30:20
is back there maybe not in that spot but
30:23
he's going to play back he will still
30:25
run this country he is president he
30:27
doesn't have to be proven to be
30:28
president he already has won
30:30
he won the other guy over here going yes
30:34
yay the termite guy
30:38
and this guy was probably in his late
30:40
40s and this young guy knew more than he
30:42
did
30:43
he was he was very aware of what was
30:45
going on you'd be surprised
30:47
if you talked to how many people voted
30:49
for the other guy
30:50
don't know anything that they're doing
30:53
because all they know
30:54
is they hate the other one
30:58
and that was their plan we will bring
31:00
this i'm serious
31:01
it's what they do in other countries
31:04
they brainwash people to believe what
31:05
they want to
31:06
then they go do whatever they feel like
31:09
that's how those people live that's how
31:11
people live in venezuela
31:12
and other countries they know what
31:15
socialism and communism is and they
31:17
don't want it this way they try to
31:18
escape
31:21
so they made a few announcements and the
31:23
whole rest of their campaign on the left
31:25
was
31:25
how horrible he is and if you ask him
31:29
why is he horrible well i don't know but
31:30
he's just
31:33
i can free you from that right now in
31:34
your soul do you wanna then they run
31:36
come over here i'll get rid of that of
31:38
your soul you need to get that out of
31:39
your shoulder you can live a normal life
31:41
again
31:44
and actually tomorrow's when i talk
31:45
about america
31:48
this is this commercial for tomorrow
31:52
amen because heaven
31:55
is celebrating everywhere right now
31:58
they're celebrating because they do know
32:00
what time it is on god's timeline
32:03
and if people don't know this is i'm
32:05
talking about pastors and i won't talk
32:06
about pastors revenge as well okay
32:08
evangelists kind of got it made because
32:10
they're still going for the big harvest
32:12
right now we're going to talk about the
32:14
naked harvest we're going on with the
32:16
big harvest that's what we're here for
32:17
what
32:17
no you should be a voice for truth no
32:19
matter what else you do you should say
32:21
the truth
32:22
let people know where you stand with
32:24
what god
32:25
wants what god asks of us let
32:28
life live let life live and don't take
32:32
it amen
32:34
and anyone who wants to take life you're
32:36
already in a really hard spot
32:38
but god if you voted for life to be
32:41
taken from babies
32:42
you are in trouble and i can honestly
32:45
say that according to the word of god
32:46
you're in trouble
32:48
you are and one day you'll be falling on
32:50
your face repenting when you find out
32:51
the truth of what the other ones were
32:53
doing continually amen
32:55
so i gotta let go let's let go and set
32:58
it back here
32:59
somewhere up here
33:03
because god is right now beginning to
33:05
create that habitation
33:06
and people need to know number one the
33:08
world's not ending
33:10
now i'm talking about heaven it's not
33:11
over say it's not over
33:14
i just the father says it's over
33:18
not even jesus knows when it's over
33:24
and i have new spheres not coming for a
33:26
church that is fighting each other angry
33:28
at each other
33:29
despising each other spitting on each
33:31
other shall i continue
33:34
coming for a church and a bride who has
33:38
no sin and no
33:41
flesh showing up in flesh and
33:44
fleshy fighting it is what the spiritual
33:48
mind is
33:49
life refreshing mind it is
33:54
he said i offer you life and death what
33:55
do you say to choose my life
33:57
a lot of people miss that this time
33:59
around
34:01
because life is what you're going to get
34:02
everybody's going to get life even the
34:04
ones who didn't want it it's going to
34:05
come it's not going to stop from coming
34:07
and he knows his timing he has a
34:09
timeline around his
34:11
behind his own throne his throne is in
34:13
the middle of the throne room
34:16
it's not on the back wall and you'd
34:18
always seen these paintings
34:20
there's god on his throne and there's
34:23
millions of people all over here who
34:25
can't get to him he didn't ever do that
34:28
it's in the middle when four sets of
34:30
steps
34:31
and people run up there all the time all
34:34
the time
34:35
if you make it to heaven you're going to
34:37
get to see god okay you get to see
34:39
father you get to see jesus
34:41
i never understood these people that
34:42
said there's levels you have to get you
34:43
after you get up there
34:44
no the bible doesn't say does that
34:47
no no it says the pure in
34:50
heart shall see god
34:54
amen and that means it can be now once
34:57
you get born again
34:58
or when you go to heaven people need to
35:01
get over that
35:02
no one can see the face of god and live
35:04
oh trust me
35:05
everything within you that was wrong
35:07
would die instantly if you saw him
35:10
but the bible clearly says the pure
35:12
heart shall see
35:14
god right so guess what i see him
35:20
i see him i see jesus christ i didn't
35:22
see the invisible spirit of god
35:24
i see the outline of his person usually
35:27
fires going around him
35:28
or whirlwinds of the rainbow or going
35:31
around him
35:32
but i see him he's big
35:37
and he is called the drama king in
35:38
heaven
35:42
well he sure creates drama every time he
35:45
touches the earth doesn't he
35:48
they were not suspecting him back in the
35:51
day when he fell
35:54
and began to do things that people were
35:56
spinning and jumping
35:58
over furniture and they really were
36:00
doing crazy wild things way back they
36:02
didn't even know what they didn't
36:03
really know what they had they just knew
36:05
it felt good
36:07
we should be well acquainted with it he
36:09
is my best friend and he speaks to me
36:12
all the time
36:13
guess what he's always speaking
36:17
always say always are you hearing him
36:22
you're hearing but maybe we need to
36:25
unclutter our soul
36:27
the more stuff you get in the layers you
36:29
are a later being holy spirit as
36:30
unlimited layers thank you holy spirit
36:32
for reminding me i was supposed to talk
36:33
about that
36:34
see i told you you don't smell the time
36:36
holy spirit is
36:38
very powerful being he's still with
36:40
celebration and joy
36:42
drama excitement that's him if there's
36:45
enough roar in heaven
36:46
holy spirit there then i get corrected
36:50
doctrinally i thought he moved to the
36:52
earth
36:54
why don't you have a conversation with
36:55
him i'll let you talk to him about that
36:57
and see what he says to you
36:58
okay he has unlimited layers of himself
37:01
so when he involves you you don't get a
37:03
little piece you get a hold of him
37:08
he takes a layer of himself and throws
37:11
it in you
37:13
that's how that happens unlimited
37:16
layers that's how he can be everywhere
37:19
all the same time
37:20
all over the world know everything see
37:23
everything
37:23
hear everything
37:27
you can invade any places he's invited
37:29
to somebody's not invited to
37:32
he's the most exciting single beings the
37:35
most excited
37:37
being in existence
37:40
right now right now i see jesus can't
37:43
come back right now
37:45
the father's up there delegating through
37:47
governmental stuff all the
37:49
stuff that's going on right now on earth
37:50
but the holy spirit
37:52
well he didn't move his operations here
37:55
that doctrinal person was right
37:57
he did jesus said when i leave i will
37:59
send who
38:00
the holy spirit the comforter the one
38:02
who will walk alongside hey walk
38:03
alongside
38:06
yeah unless you invite him in
38:09
if you ever wonder what spiritual
38:10
protocol is
38:13
even in heaven you must invite
38:16
okay you must invite i'll prove it you
38:19
invited jesus christ
38:20
right yes say yes he did we can take
38:23
care of that right now
38:24
[Music]
38:26
you must invite jesus christ
38:29
to be your savior repent of your sins
38:32
invite him to come in this is all
38:34
scriptural
38:36
john 3 16 he will come into you
38:39
he also has unlimited layers
38:42
and he made you with unlimited layers of
38:45
you
38:46
everyone in here has layers that look
38:49
just like you
38:51
is this exciting yeah it should be it's
38:54
the way you meet your soul
38:55
your soul your emotions are all your
38:57
layers the more emotional we are the
38:59
more
39:00
layers of you you have in you what does
39:01
it do with those layers well
39:03
when you get born again because you
39:05
invited him
39:07
right he takes one and he seats it in
39:10
heavenly places
39:12
and it's you it literally is it
39:14
literally really
39:15
truthfully is you it's a part of you it
39:18
looks just like you
39:21
still connected to your soul
39:24
so all around your will let's say this
39:26
is your will
39:28
it's a strong column off of that from
39:30
all these layers that look just like you
39:32
but they move like they're living
39:34
because they are this is a spiritual
39:36
part of you
39:37
not talking about your flesh your flesh
39:40
suit is your flesh seep okay
39:42
until it gets super glued together at
39:43
the end
39:47
that's glorified when you're glorified
39:51
that'll happen one day okay you don't
39:53
get glorified in heaven
39:54
you can glorify when your spirit person
39:58
who moves to heaven while your body
40:00
rests or if it's blown up or eaten by a
40:02
shark or
40:03
burnt up to nothing he knows where every
40:06
cell and molecule of you is this is true
40:08
because some people think
40:09
you can't get cremated say it's cheaper
40:12
say it's cheaper your family member was
40:16
standing right here said why didn't you
40:17
cremate me
40:19
you would have saved money and god will
40:22
still put everybody back together again
40:23
one
40:24
day because is he going to leave all the
40:25
people who were burnt out somewhere
40:28
no no you get your body back say yay
40:36
he's going to look a whole lot better
40:40
[Music]
40:42
your spiritual bodies didn't turn you
40:43
right now you go man i look good
40:47
because guess what everyone says in
40:48
heaven man you look good
40:52
you look funny you look good too
40:56
but they recognize you it says so in the
40:58
bible
40:59
it says you will be known that means
41:02
your images
41:03
you'll be known as you were known on the
41:05
earth so people will know you
41:07
everyone in heaven knows your first name
41:09
everyone's going to want a hug
41:10
say no masks in heaven
41:14
no social distancing in heaven
41:18
no handshakes in heaven
41:22
they give up hugs father abraham will
41:26
probably be the first one
41:29
if you make it to the gate because
41:32
sometimes your family members are
41:33
waiting outside
41:34
the gate when you come up to heaven
41:36
there's a landing place you come
41:38
no matter how they bring you in jesus's
41:40
own chariot
41:41
somebody's chariot a spaceship
41:44
a world war ii biplane whatever people
41:48
come in many different things whatever
41:49
would delight you the most is how you're
41:51
going to be taken some people step in
41:52
the elevator and they just go they don't
41:53
want to mess around
41:56
they're the people with few layers in
41:58
their soul okay
42:00
they got five layers just taken young
42:03
their angels stepped in this spiritual
42:05
elevator
42:06
they step in with the person and up they
42:08
go and they're there they bypass going
42:10
to see
42:10
the whole galaxies and everything which
42:12
he will take you to see if you want to
42:14
so even leaving is an experience is
42:17
a powerful experience
42:21
but you have layers in you and he made
42:23
you that way number one
42:24
spirit soul and body shall we count them
42:27
say spirits
42:28
that's a layer body that's a layer soul
42:32
that's a layer even your body
42:35
has layers right the skin the muscles
42:39
the bones you have layers there's no way
42:42
you can deny that
42:44
you have layers your spiritual layers
42:46
are some of the most exciting
42:49
so people who have a lot of emotions
42:51
down here
42:52
probably going to be magnified in heaven
42:54
your personality gets magnified in
42:56
heaven
42:58
yes the jokes are better okay
43:02
number one there's nothing defiling
43:05
nothing breaking nothing evil
43:06
nothing that anybody couldn't see the
43:09
movies are all clean
43:11
the jokes are clean stay clean
43:14
it's heaven
43:18
most exciting intense beautiful amazing
43:21
that would wonder
43:22
and splendor and creatures you've never
43:25
even seen before are there
43:27
but he made you layer for different
43:29
reasons okay
43:30
so when this layer that you're wearing
43:33
right now
43:34
sleeps or like i said it's melted down
43:36
or whatever happens to it's going to be
43:37
okay
43:38
god got it okay he's got that thing so
43:41
yeah make sure you get cremated it's
43:43
cheaper
43:45
i meant people said i'm on i want to
43:47
give my family member a funeral but
43:49
would have been seventy thousand dollars
43:50
of what i had to create it for seven
43:52
months they're probably happy you did
43:53
that
43:56
because guess what we're all going to be
43:58
back say we'll all be back
44:01
we get our bodies back they will be
44:04
young
44:05
they will be timeless timeless
44:09
there's no time in heaven everyone is
44:12
young
44:14
time doesn't go by okay
44:17
it comes from god time comes from the
44:21
father
44:22
he's in charge of time okay he does
44:25
things in heaven by
44:26
events say by events on god's timeline
44:31
it's whatever event is on there is
44:34
what's happening
44:36
there's an event right now it's not send
44:39
jesus to
44:40
get the people on the rapture rug that's
44:42
not what's on there
44:43
that's way way down way away
44:47
okay say beginning of time i could draw
44:50
a timeline
44:51
all the way down to here
44:53
[Music]
44:54
we still have all of this left at least
44:57
several hundred years maybe more
44:59
i might still be here amen y'all want to
45:03
be here during all that time
45:04
yes are you sure about that
45:07
no i am
45:11
i've not been given an option when i
45:13
said yes to do this
45:14
and my family knows they already know
45:16
i'll be here when they're gone their
45:17
kids are gone their grandkids are going
45:19
the great friends
45:19
i'll still be here i'll make them some
45:21
brownies
45:26
because he chose me for that and i said
45:28
yes
45:30
you know john could have still been here
45:33
say john
45:34
that beloved the one who jesus loved
45:38
will be very scriptural could have
45:40
remained
45:41
and be here right now if he chose that
45:46
god's not a respecter you just have to
45:49
say yes
45:50
and you have to be willing yes is nice
45:52
willing is better
45:54
willing and obedient is what he needs
45:56
okay
45:57
for people who have commissions like
46:00
that
46:00
and that's not even my gift my gift i
46:03
as you look at me i am a photographer
46:07
my passion that i'd rather do 24 hours a
46:10
day if i could would be photography
46:12
i create moments in time
46:16
that's how i look at it i don't just
46:17
take a picture there is no taking
46:19
picture
46:19
if you take pictures around me i will
46:20
correct you hold the camera up
46:23
get the light on it before you bring it
46:24
down if you stand there you're gonna
46:26
have a shadow and all those things are
46:28
outlined
46:29
when i travel and speak overseas people
46:31
always want to take pictures what's got
46:33
a picture of the castle
46:34
all their 15 friends are lined up you
46:36
see the top of the castle
46:38
if i can help you please if you all will
46:41
stand like this
46:42
leave a space for the castle then like
46:44
this you'll all be in it but you can see
46:46
the castle
46:48
because this is what you take a picture
46:49
of right now
46:53
so that's what i am i was sent from god
46:57
in my soul photographer when i go to
47:00
heaven
47:01
i'll have my own studio please come
47:03
it'll be for free which is a joke
47:05
because nothing
47:06
costs anything anyway
47:10
i will for sure have a studio because i
47:12
know whatever gift he made you
47:14
is what you would do in heaven is what
47:15
you love the most that's how heaven
47:18
uprights that's why there's so many
47:19
things to do in heaven does that make
47:20
sense to your head
47:24
well most people thought we would just
47:25
be worshipping you never stop
47:28
because when you see all the things he
47:29
made for you you will worship in the
47:31
middle of the street
47:32
anywhere everywhere you start shouting
47:34
praises to god
47:36
because he remembered all the things
47:37
that you love amen
47:40
there'll be pictures of some of your
47:41
family members in your mansion
47:43
and right now they take pictures that
47:45
you if you lost if they were burned up
47:47
in a fighter
47:48
they'll be in your mountain on the wall
47:52
it's one of the things he does i know i
47:54
saw somebody's mansion
47:56
and i saw siblings they have right now
47:59
and i saw other ones like probably maybe
48:01
i don't know 10 11 12 something like
48:03
that they weren't even born yet
48:04
and i know how many siblings this other
48:07
person
48:08
will have so people's mountains will be
48:11
quite a delight to you your crowning
48:13
room is
48:14
massive because you get more than one
48:16
crown
48:16
[Music]
48:18
he gives them out say he gives them out
48:22
at one time we will throw a specific one
48:26
we're not going to throw all of them at
48:27
him we bury him maybe i don't know
48:34
it's okay to laugh you need to know that
48:37
humor is one of the number one things in
48:39
heaven there is peace people go well
48:42
peace
48:42
be with them they die don't even rest in
48:44
the arms of jesus they're not resting
48:46
[Music]
48:47
they're riding a roller coaster
48:52
they're eating desserts somewhere
48:55
because jesus loves desserts
49:00
honey was his number one thing he ate
49:02
while he was on the earth
49:04
and guess what his cousin ate it too
49:06
right
49:07
what did johnny where's the last thing
49:11
say it loud his family was hooked on
49:14
honey
49:17
jesus loved honey we made that that
49:19
feast for them on the
49:20
shore fish and it was honey
49:25
he loves honey guess what he still loves
49:26
me i have a jar in my pantry that says
49:28
this is for jesus if he shows up
49:32
i'm ready
49:36
and to make this whole thing even
49:37
funnier people don't think they'll laugh
49:39
sometimes you laugh or cry when i talk
49:41
about it sometimes you just don't know
49:42
what to say because your
49:43
your natural brains like blanked out a
49:46
long time ago
49:49
it's going to be in the ground anyway or
49:51
where else it ever is
49:52
but but i was the person in the family
49:56
of 15 who wanted to number one be alone
50:00
in a family of 14 siblings i always
50:03
wanted to be alone was that ever going
50:04
to happen
50:06
do you think it was ever going to be
50:08
about me say no really loud
50:14
i wanted to be alone and i didn't care
50:15
if anybody knew who i was i don't know
50:17
if they knew my name i didn't want to
50:18
hug
50:18
anyone i didn't want to hug anybody that
50:21
won't be kissed
50:22
don't go to italy unless you want to be
50:24
kissed
50:26
if you go to a meeting 500 people you're
50:28
going to get a thousand kisses because
50:29
they don't just kiss you once they kiss
50:31
you on both cheeks
50:36
kiss kiss kiss kiss by these 400 people
50:39
they had four four meetings
50:42
they're making so much for my life so i
50:45
want to be alone right
50:47
i didn't want to be hugged or kissed i
50:50
didn't want anyone to know me
50:51
i knew two people and all of the schools
50:54
i attended all three of my schools i
50:56
knew two people that was it
50:58
i wasn't seeking for people i was never
51:01
part of a clique i was probably better
51:03
off
51:04
i wasn't a part of any of the crimes and
51:06
other stuff i never got into that stuff
51:08
because number one remember i could see
51:09
i saw the demons around it
51:12
you didn't have to ask me what hell was
51:13
involved in heaven was i could see it
51:16
so i didn't want any of that
51:19
so here i am just wanted to be left
51:21
alone that that wasn't going to happen
51:23
in my life
51:24
first of all i had to give myself to my
51:25
family i was always on my parents side
51:27
that made you
51:28
unpopular had 150 pets to take care of
51:34
the person we learned in the bible was
51:36
how to do a funeral
51:38
we sent every one of our pets to heaven
51:40
don't argue with me about that
51:43
i saw them there like every pet we ever
51:46
have is in heaven
51:48
my dad has him on his ranch every time
51:51
he's someone i hear
51:52
these words from my father in heaven he
51:55
gets another one
51:58
that was my dad's favorite words it was
52:00
whatever he said about anything
52:03
he he eat gas
52:08
he gave himself to the world he loved
52:09
his enemies literally
52:11
he loved his enemies it ticked him off
52:15
he loved everybody dragged him in our
52:16
house got him a bed on the floor
52:18
somewhere
52:19
fed them found them jobs got them
52:20
clothes helped them get a house
52:22
that was my dad's part in the world was
52:25
to be the love of god
52:26
my brother rj said he was meant to kill
52:29
wicked people
52:31
we only did one meeting if you never met
52:33
my brother rj you should search for
52:34
someone
52:35
yeah my brother despises injustice if he
52:39
ever was a warrior he's the warrior he
52:41
is the word
52:42
he lives out in the wilderness away from
52:43
everybody so he doesn't kill you know
52:45
half the harvest
52:46
before they get saved but he won't take
52:49
down people who call the police i found
52:50
the criminal you've been looking forward
52:51
such as
52:52
there he is already dad but they all
52:55
know him so you know he's not going to
52:57
hurt anyone that
52:58
that didn't deserve it that's what he
53:00
says our one meeting began together
53:02
he let me go first and i was just
53:04
talking about the love of god in heaven
53:06
and everything
53:07
then he gives her that high i'm rjs she
53:09
was uh she was
53:10
created by god she loved people i'm
53:12
created to kill him it's a wicked
53:16
this is the funny thing we were in a
53:17
block church because almost no white
53:19
pastors that time would invite me
53:20
i might tell you something
53:24
they weren't threatened by me
53:27
because you know their whole culture
53:28
they already had heaven culture right
53:30
yeah and i have a lot about 50 000 black
53:33
friends i love them all
53:34
right and they might guess what
53:36
righteousness truth they want all that
53:38
they do again the line drawing news
53:41
that's what god calls him the lion
53:42
crying news
53:44
but anyway so that's what he said i'm
53:46
created to kill people who would take
53:48
her out
53:48
or kill people who are wicked and evil
53:50
and belong to the devil he gets locked
53:52
on death row
53:53
he's about my height to minister to
53:56
people who are about to be
53:58
taken out yeah and he won't
54:01
not look down he will not look down most
54:03
people won't even go there's like three
54:04
levels of bars between you and the
54:06
people
54:06
he'll walk up to the closest bars he can
54:08
get to put his face right there and
54:09
stare a hole in him
54:11
and he move his eyes he'll just sit
54:13
there and then they'll go like this who
54:15
do you serve
54:17
i started the living god of heaven on
54:18
earth you made you
54:20
carried you before you he gave you
54:21
commission said he earth to bring life
54:23
to people not to hurt them
54:25
you need to know jesus christ because i
54:26
know what hell looks like too and you'll
54:28
burn forever and you won't like it
54:31
they don't know what to do with him
54:33
right he goes and gets all these
54:34
prisoners one to jesus christ
54:37
he won't back down he's certainly not
54:38
back now and i won't tell you what he
54:39
wants to do to those people in the
54:41
barbed wire in dc
54:45
so my siblings are very different from
54:47
each other i learned to love everybody
54:49
no matter where you're from
54:50
where you're at you know i can honestly
54:52
say i love you because god
54:54
in me loves you so our job here is to
54:58
love to share the truth right
55:01
you don't have to force people to get
55:02
saved you can't do that anyway it has to
55:04
be a decision in here right
55:06
and make a decision we just water it you
55:09
know and share and then water it
55:10
somebody else water then somebody
55:12
wins them to jesus christ holy spirit
55:15
draws them say holy spirit draws them
55:20
it would be much harder with that holy
55:22
spirit on the earth okay that's why he
55:24
was sent way back in jesus
55:25
time it wasn't easy to live that either
55:28
but easy to live in the beginning right
55:31
after jesus left
55:33
but it certainly is different now and
55:36
you were made
55:38
by god very specific when he sent you
55:43
he wrote words on the will on your will
55:46
wrote on your actual will sometimes i
55:48
can see him on people's will
55:50
because i'm a seer i see spiritual
55:52
things he wrote words of what he
55:55
wanted you to be what he created you to
55:57
be in the earth
55:58
that book she writes every day of your
56:00
life in you're in a book
56:02
that's there you get it when you go to
56:04
heaven this is what he intended for you
56:06
this is what he purposed for you but
56:08
sometimes the enemy got you off track
56:10
sometimes wicked people did things
56:12
he didn't intent and he he that was not
56:14
his purpose he created the earth so he
56:16
could take you
56:17
from him where you live and when
56:20
the time of conception comes holy spirit
56:22
takes your little spiritual being
56:24
and knits you together to that dot of
56:26
flesh
56:27
that's i knit you together in your
56:29
mother's womb
56:30
that's not putting your arms and legs
56:32
down this nobody on this earth can do
56:34
this spiritual thing nobody
56:36
can even know where your spiritual being
56:38
is
56:39
the spirit of life talked about the
56:41
bible was you
56:44
you wrote in and out on the rays of the
56:46
rainbow from the father they still do
56:47
send me i want to i want to love people
56:50
to send me i want to go to earth for you
56:51
they'll say that to the father all the
56:53
time
56:54
that's what you did you played in the
56:56
river of life inside him he jumped on
56:57
the stones and fired
56:58
a massive gemstones burning with his
57:02
passion
57:03
that's where everyone here came from
57:06
everyone who's on the earth
57:10
came from that place the father carries
57:13
you
57:14
in him in him we live we move we have
57:17
our being
57:18
the prophets and poets of the old have
57:20
spoken of these things
57:23
that means they will show that it
57:25
reveals them where they came from
57:28
everyone no matter what they believe or
57:31
where they're at right now in this world
57:33
came from him
57:37
he is our father we are his offspring
57:41
his heart is that you know him that you
57:44
love him that you receive his son
57:47
so you can be with him in heaven because
57:48
jesus is the way
57:50
back to the father
57:54
and when anyone dies and they are caught
57:56
up to heaven
57:57
jesus meets you he walks you up the
57:59
steps of the throne
58:00
and says to his father here i have
58:02
brought them home to you
58:05
is part of his reward for dying for us
58:09
he knows everything about you still
58:11
loves you
58:12
still wants you has purpose for your
58:16
life here
58:18
this is the thing about the babies this
58:19
is awesome every baby when every baby
58:22
was sent he wrote on their wills
58:24
and by the way he wrote whether they
58:25
were male or female
58:28
yeah some other group can't teach
58:30
anybody that i know they'd like to do
58:31
that too by the way
58:33
they wrote that on some piece of paper
58:35
somewhere
58:38
he wrote in here and when people try to
58:41
be
58:41
some other thing that they're not they
58:44
have great
58:45
conflict in their soul their soul fights
58:47
against them
58:48
because their soul already knows if
58:52
you're male or female let alone what
58:53
your body is saying to you
58:55
they know that's what they were meant to
58:56
be and i have talked to many
58:58
people who switched that and have
59:02
switched back and would all tell me the
59:03
same thing
59:04
i had conflict all the time in my soul
59:06
it would fight and say no that's not you
59:09
that is not you that's not how you were
59:10
made you're meant to be
59:12
i will tell you this there is going to
59:13
be in one of these of god
59:15
millions of homosexuals will get born
59:18
again like
59:19
like in a sudden a way
59:24
and if they had operations they get
59:26
their stuff put back on
59:27
yeah talk about a sign and a wonder
59:31
right here
59:35
he's going to do it
59:38
he's going to do that because he made us
59:41
very specifically
59:42
he made us detailed our personalities
59:46
are different your personality is still
59:47
different in heaven
59:48
you're just nicer if you weren't nice
59:50
down here
59:52
you laugh and control me and you won't
59:54
get to stop it either
59:56
this place isn't heaven they go just for
59:58
the laughter okay waves of it
60:00
come out of places and hit you and just
60:02
roll on the ground you never did that
60:04
get used to it
60:06
practice maybe then i saw a spot
60:11
i was one of those people that didn't
60:12
laugh i was so serious i was serious
60:14
serious with the capital s
60:16
i was serious i was serious
60:19
i wanted everything to be done right
60:20
that was me
60:22
you know when my mom knew she left me
60:23
the house would still be burning and not
60:25
be burnt down
60:26
that i'd know where everybody was and
60:28
they'd be okay they may not be happy
60:29
with me
60:31
but but that was my assignment to keep
60:33
everybody together and keep them safe
60:35
and i i made like 10 sandwiches every
60:38
day for their lunch and helped them with
60:39
homework at night
60:41
then if i was they were sick i've got to
60:42
pray for them and sit with them until
60:44
they were better and
60:45
this was my life this was my life like
60:47
young my life
60:49
and i didn't say no to my parents i
60:51
honored my mother and my father
60:54
i get to do this now i get to have pink
60:57
hair which was ordered by heaven okay
60:59
i get to eat cake i still have to watch
61:01
how much i eat
61:02
okay i celebrate all the time because i
61:05
already know
61:06
i know what my end is i also pretty much
61:08
know what your end is
61:10
and it's because i'm willing have been
61:12
taken back in the past and shown how
61:14
things happen so i can give revelation
61:16
taken forward in the future i've had
61:18
glimpses of the new earth
61:20
and all the other worlds around it
61:24
i've seen father son holy spirit seven
61:27
spirits of god
61:28
melchizedek who is the father's high
61:30
priest and always has been
61:32
he has always had flesh on him i'm going
61:34
to really mess with your mind now
61:36
now has always had flesh before god made
61:38
flesh
61:39
on people on the earth
61:42
he's really neat looking he serves the
61:45
father at the obedience of the father
61:47
he came to the earth became the king of
61:49
salem collected tithes from abraham
61:51
that's why he could see
61:52
him he's also the one who's oh head of
61:55
the tribe of angels that there's a whole
61:57
tribe of angels
61:59
that god put flesh on so you can send
62:02
them to the earth as watch your angels
62:04
not all of them fell everybody says oh
62:06
my god not all of them
62:07
some did some did not they have flush
62:12
that's why they can make offspring i
62:14
hope your answers are getting
62:15
given okay but melchizedek still serves
62:18
the father
62:19
that's his position personal high priest
62:22
to the living god
62:24
the seven spirits of god also serve god
62:27
they serve him
62:28
they are his that means they serve him
62:31
that doesn't mean that they're his seven
62:32
attributes everybody
62:34
every syllabus i've ever seen okay seven
62:36
spirits of god here's the syllabus and
62:37
in five minutes i can tell you what it
62:39
is
62:41
okay how to explain the trinity some
62:43
people can't they think we have a
62:44
three-headed god
62:45
no they have the ability to step inside
62:48
of each other
62:50
father you know son holy spirit
62:53
holy spirit steps in the father jesus
62:56
steps in the father here's the three in
62:58
one
62:59
and that's how he showed me helped up to
63:01
heaven said i'm going to show you the
63:02
three in one
63:03
and they all came i said here we are
63:04
father son holy spirit
63:06
in a couple minutes of time if there was
63:08
time
63:09
i understood what people have tried to
63:11
figure out for years
63:12
when he said jesus said father me and
63:15
you when you and me
63:16
he literally meant me inside you and you
63:19
inside me
63:20
and when they began to create before
63:22
there was anything there was heaven
63:25
the father's house there's nothing but
63:27
the spirits around
63:28
the father would step up where there's
63:30
nothing he would speak
63:32
physical realm jesus stepped out of him
63:35
he was called the word stepped out
63:36
and a drop of water in his hand he
63:39
stretched it into a canvas
63:41
and he wrapped it around just like this
63:44
a huge part of the spirit realm
63:46
and we created the physical round and
63:48
then he began to hang
63:50
the planets on there anything visible
63:53
he couldn't hang physical things on a
63:55
spiritual thing
63:58
that's why spirits can walk through this
64:00
physical wall because the original realm
64:02
supersedes this physical realm which is
64:04
temporal
64:06
that's how he did it and from that
64:08
moment they began to create everything
64:10
in the physical realm we created the
64:11
planets
64:12
they didn't make the sun in the moon yet
64:17
because the first earth when he made it
64:19
the first time was lit with his glory
64:24
millions of years between verse
64:27
one mercy millions
64:31
millions say millions
64:35
i hope that messes up your mind too you
64:37
know who doesn't mess it up it doesn't
64:39
mess up scientists
64:42
they ask the uh i'm not going to say
64:44
astrological
64:46
the astronomy people already have an
64:48
understanding
64:49
that this earth is well well over
64:52
millions and millions and millions and
64:53
millions of years
64:54
old those who dig in the dirt and find
64:55
the dinosaurs and the layers of the
64:57
earth
64:57
they already understand that man man
65:01
man has been here for a limited time but
65:04
the earth itself has been here for a
65:06
very very long time
65:08
so when there's darkness covering the
65:10
earth because of what happened before
65:11
that
65:12
right in the beginning means before
65:14
there was time
65:16
in the beginning was when the earth was
65:18
just a thought in god's head
65:20
when he made the earth
65:23
it was perfect it was beautiful there
65:24
was no sin in it
65:26
he said to watch your angels to watch
65:28
over all the creatures that were on the
65:29
earth the dinosaurs roamed the earth
65:32
there was a water vapor shield around
65:33
the whole earth that put mist on the
65:36
ears because it hadn't
65:37
rained there had been no storms yet on
65:39
the earth there was only one landmass
65:41
and all this ocean was around it how do
65:44
i know
65:45
he took me back in time and showed me
65:47
how he created the heavens and the earth
65:49
and when i explain this to an
65:50
evolutionist they want to know god
65:55
because they have answers to the
65:57
questions they've always had
65:58
what about that footprint they found by
66:00
the dinosaur that was a watcher angel
66:04
who had flesh on him so his footprint
66:06
was in the dirt
66:07
there's no crow magnum man there were
66:08
never there never was a chromatin a man
66:11
okay
66:12
god didn't make people that were half
66:13
ape and half person and put them on the
66:15
earth okay
66:16
we are we didn't come from monkeys say
66:18
we didn't come from monkeys
66:21
say we're made in the image of god
66:24
he's not a monkey
66:28
the angels laugh every time they hear us
66:30
every time they watch the slime pool
66:32
thing
66:32
every time they watch someone talk about
66:34
the big bang they laugh so hard they
66:36
would cry if they could
66:37
[Music]
66:39
because that takes a lot more faith to
66:41
believe
66:42
than god making us putting us here right
66:46
so having this involved very much in our
66:48
lives always has been involved
66:50
the angels are all over in here they all
66:53
your angels are here and most of mine
66:56
are outside because they couldn't fit in
66:58
here
67:02
and god gave me promises all kinds of
67:03
promises just said yes i'll do this for
67:05
you however long it takes i don't care
67:07
he said one day i'll open their eyes
67:09
everybody will see the angels one day
67:10
i'll take everybody to heaven
67:12
so everybody raise always do this raise
67:13
your hand up
67:15
say we're ready right now take us for a
67:19
trip
67:21
let's see if it happens not today
67:27
that may seem strange to some people but
67:29
one day it will be happening the closer
67:31
we get
67:32
towards the end and the end for people
67:35
might be
67:36
the rapture but i can tell you this
67:40
all the stuff in the bible is going to
67:41
happen it will all happen the
67:42
tribulation the perilous times
67:44
it's going to happen christening on the
67:46
third jerusalem is going to happen for
67:48
that thousand years
67:49
satan being taken off the earth during
67:50
the time is going to happen he'll be
67:52
back on the earth to tempt all the ones
67:55
who were born
67:56
people lived to be seven eight nine
67:57
hundred years old during that time
67:59
uh if you died at 100 that would be like
68:01
a child
68:03
say timelessness is coming to the earth
68:08
before them
68:12
yes it said that there would be a
68:14
generation of people
68:15
on the earth that would taste of the
68:17
powers of the age to come the
68:19
age to come after this age we're in
68:22
is the millennial age so he's not done
68:26
with this one yet it's not going to end
68:28
okay but there would be people living
68:31
in your time i'm saying over the next
68:34
couple hundred years
68:35
in this time who will be timeless will
68:37
begin not to age
68:39
who will travel to the spirit realm all
68:40
the time rather than the physical realm
68:43
who do amazing signs and wonders for him
68:45
that's why he needs
68:46
this time right now to clean a lot of
68:49
the evil off of the earth
68:51
he can't even send new inventions
68:53
there's inventions that haven't happened
68:55
yet that will actually make our life
68:57
so much easier and so different that he
69:00
won't put them here until the evil is
69:02
pushed back
69:04
say god is not willing to give those
69:07
inventions
69:09
to the wicked if you see his big picture
69:13
about all this is happening you will
69:14
understand
69:15
why all the evil is being exposed and
69:19
it's being exposed
69:20
all over the world why is this happening
69:23
say god's going to clean
69:26
that platform off collard
69:31
so we can step into the greater days of
69:35
glory
69:38
that's why if everything had happened is
69:41
normal
69:43
and there's all kinds of stuff going on
69:44
we didn't know if everything had
69:46
happened as normal on november 3rd
69:48
then a lot of that would never be found
69:50
out it wouldn't be known
69:52
the evil wickedness would still be there
69:54
hiding plotting and planning
69:56
and god isn't going to do some things
69:58
until a lot of them are taken off
70:02
who understands please raise your hand
70:05
if you were god and you had great things
70:06
to send to the earth
70:08
would you allow all that to remain
70:11
and you can see just in our country
70:13
alone how that has interfered
70:16
you can imagine saying no holds barred
70:18
for anybody easier than what you want to
70:21
it would be really hard to have any of
70:22
that happen right
70:25
so he does have a plan it is going to we
70:28
are having justice it will come
70:31
not just here but around the world and
70:33
there's be some people here you will see
70:35
no more see there'll be people here
70:38
say it wicked people
70:42
who will be here no more
70:45
that is his plan amen amen so you're
70:48
living in different days
70:49
this is all different our lives have had
70:51
to be different right
70:53
it's going to be worth it for what is
70:56
coming that no
70:57
man can stop or interfere with and your
71:00
family member is going to be running to
71:02
you to find out who jesus christ
71:04
is there's going to be a lot of
71:06
salvations happening
71:07
because people number one are going to
71:08
know there's a god
71:10
because only god could do all what's
71:13
going to be done
71:14
so on god's timeline we're right there
71:17
at one of his things right now on his
71:19
timeline
71:20
right now we're there so everybody here
71:23
is born because he needs you here he
71:25
wants you here okay
71:26
no one is a mistake no matter how
71:30
you got here or who he sent you to
71:34
he never purpose evil for you or
71:37
harm or tragedy so everybody's seeing
71:40
enough we're going to do oh we're going
71:41
to do a soul checkup
71:43
and i do it for the sake of those who
71:45
probably wouldn't ever do it
71:48
this is available to the body of christ
71:50
to be free of everything that's hindered
71:52
you hurt you
71:53
any tragedy anything that happened in
71:55
your life that you keep having memories
71:57
of
71:58
maybe even nightmares about you won't
71:59
have them no more
72:01
if you're involved in addictions and you
72:04
sincerely lose that addiction from your
72:06
soul he'll come down and pull out of you
72:08
amen and this is something the father
72:12
taught me himself
72:13
it's the first time i actually looked at
72:14
my clock and then he told me that i'm
72:16
going to teach you something and i
72:17
looked at my clock it's all the time
72:19
when i came back it was four hours later
72:23
my staff had been beating on my door my
72:25
daughter come over to see me
72:27
and i didn't answer anybody my body was
72:28
there i wasn't there
72:31
he took me and showed me how he made a
72:33
human soul why he mean it that way
72:36
how important it is to understand the
72:37
fullness of the peace of the kingdom
72:40
i'm telling you about the keys of the
72:42
kingdom that's what this is you call it
72:43
something else he calls it a soul
72:45
checkup
72:45
you should do it all the time i used to
72:49
teach it once and then that was nice
72:51
and i found out a few weeks later no
72:52
this is a lifestyle
72:55
if someone says something horrible
72:56
bashing hurting to you
72:58
you turn around loose those words from
73:00
your soul
73:01
and him will go and it will be to you
73:04
like they never happened
73:06
if you saw traumas if you had tragedies
73:09
if you
73:10
lose that tragedy from your soul he'll
73:12
come down and go shh
73:13
it'll be like it never happened to you
73:16
you can talk about it there's no hurt
73:19
there's no fear
73:20
there's no suffering no matter what it
73:22
was you don't have to have
73:24
that in you he doesn't want it in you
73:26
his explanation to me was
73:28
i don't have time for them to have six
73:29
weeks or six months or six years of
73:31
therapy
73:32
i don't have that kind of time i need
73:34
them free i need them free right now
73:36
that's why i'm going to teach you this
73:37
and if you're willing to learn it and
73:39
train them
73:40
then i will show you who melchizedek is
73:43
you give me promises i'll do this for
73:45
you and i didn't ask him
73:46
i'll do this for you do this video i'll
73:48
do this for you and of course you know i
73:50
said yes
73:52
i know you'd be the whole world i'd be
73:53
training that's okay
73:56
it's the most important thing you
73:57
probably learn other than knowing jesus
73:59
christ you can walk through your life
74:01
with no pain no suffering no fear
74:04
no grief no traumas
74:07
no addictions now it may try to come
74:10
back to you saying nope
74:12
i got rid of you i'm not taking you back
74:14
and the devil will try to bring back
74:16
whatever he can you say nope it's gone
74:19
and i've done this with too many people
74:20
for you to try to tell me
74:22
it doesn't work it does work
74:26
so if you're a born-again believer you
74:28
can do this
74:29
okay so first i always start with we're
74:31
all going to repent and say father
74:33
father i come before your throne i come
74:35
before you
74:37
i love your son jesus christ i love you
74:40
right now i'm going to clean up my salt
74:42
right now i'm going to clean it up
74:44
i repent of any sin
74:47
since my original repentance
74:50
i don't want any of it in me so i'm
74:53
giving it back to your son
74:56
i thank you jesus thank you jesus for
74:59
cleansing my soul for blessing
75:01
my soul that i can be free of all sin
75:05
amen amen now we're going to do this
75:08
soul checkup
75:09
i will list things that you need to lose
75:11
from your soul but if i don't say
75:13
something you can say that yourself
75:15
and everyone does it so nobody's going
75:17
to be figured out
75:18
or pointed out the one thing i will see
75:20
is stuff leaving you
75:22
i'ma the seer i will see jesus come down
75:24
he pulls gray matter out of you
75:27
that's what it looks like it looks like
75:28
gray because you have the light of god
75:31
but if you have darkness in there if you
75:32
play with sin or play with stuff
75:35
and the enemy looks in you he will see
75:37
gray he will go after you
75:40
he'll already go after you so that's why
75:42
number one you don't want to keep it
75:43
right
75:44
he also doesn't want people bashing
75:46
screaming
75:47
yelling because you sound like hell when
75:50
you do that
75:52
our words are supposed to bring life
75:55
yes amen we're here to bring light and
75:58
love
75:59
and life those three things that's why
76:01
you're here
76:02
so if you have anger issues there's
76:04
something in your soul
76:06
that keeps making you do that so you can
76:08
lose anger from your soul it won't ever
76:10
come back again
76:12
don't go watch 10 movies with profanity
76:15
in them
76:16
i have to say this about profanity that
76:18
is hell's language
76:20
you are literally speaking the language
76:22
of hell
76:23
if they hear enough they're going to
76:25
start showing up
76:27
because they recognize those words
76:30
that's why god says no profane word
76:33
should come out of your mouth there it
76:35
is right there
76:35
no profane words should be spoken by you
76:38
amen
76:39
it's not in heaven no one in heaven
76:42
talks like that
76:43
i've been to hell three times and it was
76:45
filled that's the only language they
76:46
speak
76:48
so we don't want to represent now we're
76:50
not here for that right
76:52
and i'm sure you may have good reasons
76:54
to get angry
76:55
or upset it says you can be angry and
76:57
sin not okay
76:59
don't add that to your list we're not
77:02
supposed to wound people with our words
77:04
so please don't bash
77:05
people when people they say this when
77:08
people lash out at you
77:10
they're afraid fear
77:13
causes people to lash out they'll never
77:15
admit that
77:17
they won't even think that but fear
77:19
makes you lash out
77:21
that's what happens and i always know
77:23
that person needs help
77:24
if they're bashing me they need help and
77:27
so that's how i look and that's how god
77:29
has taught me to look at it so
77:32
we should always be here to help people
77:34
if people don't like you or they're mean
77:36
to you
77:36
please forgive them go in a room forgive
77:38
them loose all of it out of your soul
77:40
whatever it is maybe teach little kids
77:42
do this
77:43
even little kids if they're if they're
77:45
bashed at school or bullied at school
77:47
you as their parent can lay your hand on
77:49
their head and say as a watcher over
77:51
their soul
77:52
i choose to loose from my child's soul
77:54
all the hateful mean
77:55
ugly words that were spoken to him today
77:58
i loose them in jesus name and jesus
78:00
will come down and pull them out of the
78:02
soul of the child and those children
78:04
will act like it never happened
78:07
you have the right to do that because
78:08
you're the parent amen
78:10
so this is something you can live do for
78:12
the rest of your life
78:14
when something happens immediately to
78:16
you that's the best time to do it
78:17
if you're in grief i understand you miss
78:19
somebody but don't let that grief still
78:21
be there a year two years three years
78:22
five years
78:23
like don't build like a memorial it's
78:26
okay to put the pictures on the wall
78:27
i'm saying don't go in there and reap
78:29
over them all the time
78:30
they're in heaven saying please have a
78:32
life
78:34
they're up there saying please laugh
78:36
please let it go please release me
78:38
some people if your parents or loved
78:41
ones have died and you're still grieving
78:42

78:44
with my will to release my loved one
78:46
into the hands of jesus to complete
78:48
whatever destiny he has for them in
78:49
heaven
78:50
when you do that they will hear that in
78:52
heaven number one it will make them very
78:54
happy
78:55
it will remove grief out of you that
78:57
didn't leave yet

79:03
to you all the time
79:04
about how horrible it was that they died
79:06
they repeat how they die
79:08

79:10
they just know one thing
79:11
they're happy they're there and people
79:14
got saved in the last minute are really
79:16

what god called you to be no matter
86:19
what's going around you
86:21
but when those things aren't in you it's
86:23
much easier
86:24
but if you want the fullness of god
86:27
you can ask for more than just your rent
86:30
being paid
86:31
food on your table you know things that
86:33
need to be fixed or hold us fine
86:35
but he wants you to be more than that
86:38
you
86:38
have not because you asked not
86:41
today we're going to ask to have things
86:44
bound to our soul
86:46
when you do that he comes and he puts
86:48
them in you
86:49
some of them come in waves i see whole
86:52
waves
86:53
of the joy of the lord whole waves of
86:55
his presence
86:56

87:00
do you are you all ready to ask for them
87:01
yes say i choose
87:04
as an act of my will to bind to my soul
87:08
my soul the love of god the love of god
87:13
the life of god the light of god the
87:16
presence of the lord
87:19
the joy of the lord
87:22

88:16
time
88:16
all the time in jesus name
88:22
i bind to my soul the goodness of god
88:27
and it will be
88:28

89:05
extreme discernment i can operate for
89:08
him the way he needs to
89:11
be in jesus name so be it
89:15
[Applause]
89:22
amen
89:40
[Music]
89:43
he has great plans for all of us
89:46
and it doesn't depend on your age your
89:49
position
89:50
doesn't depend on anything but one thing
89:53
you belong to his son
89:55
right do you mean that decision to
89:57
accept christ and his sacrifice
90:00
i know a lot about things that happened
90:03
the day
90:04
that he died on the cross a lot about
90:07
what happened
90:08
from the moment his he had his spirit
90:10
leave his body
90:12
i think if he hadn't told him to leave
90:14
he might still be there
90:16
because he did he commanded the spirit
90:18
mentally leave his body
90:20
and his body was taken down it was
90:21
placed in the tomb
90:24
god appointed two angels to be with
90:26
christ
90:27
through many different times in his life
90:29
if it said angels came and comforted him
90:31
it was the same two angels
90:33
that they were always with and they were
90:34
with him in the garden they were chosen
90:36
to bring that cup that cup is a real cup
90:41
the thing he drank all the wickedness
90:43
and evil and every sin and wickedness
90:45
that existed he drank that that's what
90:48
had to be nailed to the cross it wasn't
90:49
just his physical body
90:51
it's what he carried to the cross
90:54
if people ask you how come jesus is the
90:56
only one who can forgive sins you tell
90:58
them that
90:59
he's the only one to drink all of the
91:02
evil of
91:03
every single sin into his being
91:07
and was willing to nail back to the
91:09
cross
91:10
and at that time he can abolish sin
91:13
in our lives when we repent is the only
91:16
one who's done that
91:17
he's the only one who's made that
91:18
sacrifice willing so he is the only one
91:21
that has the power to forgive sin
91:23
and he is the only way back to heaven
91:27
someone else has another heaven good
91:29
luck
91:30
the one i saw belonged to the god of the
91:33
bible
91:34
his son jesus christ holy spirit so many
91:37
angels
91:38
millions upon millions upon millions
91:40
upon millions upon millions upon
91:42
millions of angels
91:43
i've seen in heaven around in heaven all
91:45
over the earth
91:47
they belong to him amen
91:50
he made them for specific purposes
91:52
they're made in tribes
91:53
like there's tribes of watcher angels
91:55
tribes of couriers trying
91:57
of scribes and then there is the army of
91:59
heaven
92:01
that is a whole different creature
92:06
when it talks about the living creatures
92:08
before the throne of god you're pretty
92:09
much describing
92:10
most of the army of heaven they don't
92:13
look normal
92:14
they don't look like human eye and they
92:17
have wings whether you ever see them or
92:18
not
92:19
some are made out of just force i can't
92:22
even explain that they
92:23
they don't have any kind of shape that
92:25
you can identify
92:26
some have eyes some have 30 eyes some
92:29
have eyes all over their body some have
92:30
eyes in the front in the back
92:32
some have two heads front and front
92:36
i'm not going to explain that hello
92:41
hello
92:46
i was present when they brought
92:50
a gift to my grandson when he was born
92:52
and he is a carrier of the love of god
92:56
and he's going to be an athlete who will
92:58
win olympics
92:59
and he's focused he's got two things in
93:01
his life he's so focused i can't figure
93:03
his brain out
93:04
he can run faster than his father or
93:06
anybody who's ever tried
93:08
to beat him but what he will talk to you
93:10
about
93:11
is the love of god he was assigned these
93:15
two angels who were one being and their
93:17
names are passion
93:18
and compassion and they're with him all
93:21
the time
93:23
he has other angels who are with him uh
93:25
his main angel's name
93:26
is flash
93:30
your number one angel assigned to you is
93:32
because of the gift
93:34
you have mine is about 40 foot tall i've
93:37
never seen him
93:38
when i was a little tiny thing i could
93:39
see him following me around all the time
93:42
i apologize to him all the time
93:44
you probably shouldn't have heard me say
93:46
that i'm sorry
93:49
then he grins at me sometimes he rolls
93:51
his eyes at me but not often
93:54
he's there to protect me to watch over
93:56
me
93:57
sometimes he'll bring me things from
93:58
heaven and but
94:00
but this grandson's angels always uh oh
94:04
i know all my brain kids angels actually
94:06
speak to them hi thank you for watching
94:08
over them
94:09
you know they're going to be going here
94:11
i know you know that but
94:12
just pay attention
94:15
and and so yeah the one who's fast is
94:18
almost the speed of light
94:20
the first one is the first friends and
94:22
is very creative he started making trips
94:24
to him when he was three
94:26
he seen my dad talk to my dad described
94:28
my dad he never met my dad on the earth
94:30
my dad keeps giving his favorite candies
94:33
candies were around in the 50s that they
94:36
don't even have anymore
94:38
he's gone inside of a volcano in heaven
94:40
and rode the lava hound
94:42
with my dad he described
94:45
cars that could drive up the side of
94:46
mountains without wheels
94:48
they exist in heaven i never told him
94:50
about that
94:51
he's been making trips now for five
94:53
years
94:55
and he'll just say the most surprising
94:57
things come out of his mouth
94:58
nobody's saying anything he could lead a
95:01
service baptized so get people saved
95:03
baptized in water
95:04
cast demons out they have never been a
95:06
trim in the public school that was
95:07
probably a good thing
95:08
you'd be down the principal's office all
95:10
the time
95:12
your son just baptized someone in the
95:13
water fountain again
95:17
and he would yeah and the second one is
95:20
over the love of god will pray for
95:21
everybody
95:22
if he sees anyone limp in the store
95:24
anyway he'll run up to them in jesus
95:26
name
95:26
be healed
95:30
and the third one is a girl
95:35
and she would be she will dance and sing
95:38
and there will be weapons she'll be very
95:40
fierce they should
95:41
named her middle name fierce and i got
95:44
two pages on her before she was born
95:46
one whole one and a half pages of how
95:48
fierce it she'll be
95:50
she is fierce she runs for brothers
95:56
she totally understands things from god
95:59
she's for
96:00
sees things here's things her passion to
96:03
worship
96:04
surpasses everything else she's got
96:05
she's all about worship
96:07
singing and dancing and now she's
96:09
wanting to learn to play the violin i'm
96:10
sure that will be very
96:12
dangerous to hell when she does that
96:13
because what you do in worship is
96:15
dangerous against hell
96:18
your prayers are your worship is however
96:20
you do that by
96:23
that's painting danger to how when you
96:25
sing
96:26
dance if you flag whatever it is that
96:29
you do is worship
96:30
you create images that are captured and
96:32
taken before the throne of god
96:35
so she's fierce her angel that protects
96:38
her is the size of a mountain
96:40
his name is rock and he's got this
96:43
little tiny
96:44
person that he follows around you know i
96:47
every time i visit wherever they're all
96:48
at i thank them all the time for
96:50
watching over them
96:52
and so i know their names i know what
96:55
they will be
96:56
one of my rewards god loves children
97:00
she needs children you are not just
97:04
raising a child
97:05
you are shaping souls to the kingdom
97:08
and i talk more about the kingdom
97:10
usually than i do the actual world
97:13
that's why christ came he came to tell
97:16
us about the gospel of the kingdom
97:18
it wasn't just about dying that's just
97:21
how everything begins with you
97:23
ruling and reigning in the spirit realm
97:25
is what he actually has
97:27
for you you rule with him because he
97:30
rules
97:31
we have ultimate authority in this earth
97:34
over this earth over anything in this
97:37
earth
97:38
everything of satan has been put under
97:41
our feet
97:42
we have power over all say all
97:46
the power of the enemy we're going to
97:49
learn how to use it
97:53
we are he's starting something new brand
97:56
new
97:57
right in the middle of all this time
97:59
actually gave all the revelation about
98:01
it on the day of the fake
98:03
inauguration
98:06
it will happen the body will learn who
98:09
they are
98:10
what your authorities in the spirit
98:11
realm how to use that authority
98:13
how to crush darkness push it back it'll
98:15
be a different life to live in this
98:17
world
98:18
amen demons will run from you they won't
98:21
try to attack you they will try to get
98:23
away from you
98:24
because what you carry will cause great
98:27
pain to them yes
98:28
the light and the glory of god is
98:30
painful to the enemy
98:32
that's why when it showed up in hell on
98:34
the third day they were screaming
98:36
their faces were melting they couldn't
98:38
get away from christ fast enough
98:41
that is what it's going to be like to
98:43
live in this world with you
98:46
so you're not unimportant you're not
98:48
just a person you're not an old sinner
98:50
say by grace don't ever say that again
98:53
you are considered royalty in heaven
98:55
your manifested sons and daughters of
98:58
the most high god you are the love
99:02
of jesus christ life he gave
99:05
everything for you that's how much he
99:06
loves you
99:09
holy spirit can't wait to get to know
99:11
you better
99:13
he will share things with you that will
99:14
probably undo your natural mind
99:18
because heaven is not this world
99:21
it's only a shadow earth is a shadow of
99:24
what is in heaven
99:26
and what he has waiting for all of us
99:28
now in this life
99:29
probably won't be repeated again
99:32
what he starts now will continue until
99:35
the end of this age
99:37
and even those christians who would
99:39
become christians during the tribulation
99:41
will be a thorn in the flesh of satan
99:44
they won't be crying they won't be
99:46
hiding when it comes time
99:49
it's going to be executed i've already
99:50
been shown that they will be dancing in
99:52
the line
99:54
which would be the biggest irritation to
99:56
say who finding things
99:57
i'm really going to get them now they'll
100:00
already know they already had trips to
100:02
heaven by that time a lot of people will
100:03
be
100:04
uh it will be normal for people to be
100:06
caught up to have many times
100:07
doing greatest some of the greatest
100:09
things on the earth until things begin
100:11
to switch
100:11
okay i cannot tell you for sure
100:14
that the body will not be on this earth
100:16
when that happens but i will just repeat
100:18
what the word says
100:19
until he that is with hell is removed
100:22
the antichrist cannot appear on the
100:24
earth well i can tell you what if we
100:27
were all here
100:27
he would be able to do nothing he is not
100:31
here anywhere in the earth right now god
100:34
wouldn't be starting these greater days
100:36
of glory with so much
100:37
power of god being seen and felt and
100:39
known in the earth
100:41
satan would not be able to fulfill his
100:43
thing
100:44
his few years his bump in the road
100:47
that's what god says he gets a bump in
100:48
the road
100:50
he won't be able to operate that operate
100:52
like that in those days people will be
100:53
looking for a savior someone who can
100:56
rescue them from the horrific perils
100:58
times
100:58
which will also be a short time they
101:00
will take anybody
101:03
okay so who shows up is the antichrist
101:06
and he's actually going to be good for
101:07
the first three and a half years to fool
101:09
everybody
101:09
he only does all the evil stuff the last
101:11
three and a half years
101:13
and he still won't get the whole world i
101:15
don't know why people think he will
101:17
he won't there's going to be rednecks
101:20
here
101:20
that will not want him that will not
101:24
take satan
101:24
even during the tribulation and there
101:28
will be people
101:28
on the earth when christ comes to sit on
101:30
the thorn in jerusalem that didn't die
101:32
even during that time
101:34
and they will have a long time to make
101:37
their decision for christ you
101:39
have still have to get saved even during
101:41
the time when christ is on the throne
101:43
and some of those kings how about this
101:46
want one in there
101:47
knowing he's the son of god knowing he
101:49
will actually control the weather and
101:51
all these other things he will sit as
101:52
king of the world
101:54
and they will want in there so the satan
101:57
is loosed
101:57
1 000 years later out of the pit he will
102:00
have no authority or
102:01
power in the earth for that 1000 years
102:04
christ will have holy
102:05
ruling in the earth there will be people
102:07
who survive the tribulation that will
102:09
live
102:10
here during that time so
102:13
sometimes you'll understand things
102:14
sometimes you had a big picture given to
102:16
you right now
102:17
we still have a long way to go but at
102:20
this point
102:21
in history in heaven and on the earth
102:24
are the
102:24
greater days it's not the darker days
102:27
amen
102:29
i know some pastors if they don't have
102:31
revelation and they don't know what's
102:32
going on they always go to the end
102:35
this is the tribulation everybody get
102:37
ready for all this to happen
102:38
it's not going to happen evil is not
102:40
taking over this world right now it's
102:42
actually going to be diminished for a
102:44
very long time

02:53
glory here all the time we have so many
02:55
angels here on assignment and I just I
02:58
just got a feeling some of New York and
03:00
just going to get healed you know a lot
03:02
of times it happens during worship
03:03
happens during the word and so we
03:07
definitely haven't opened heaven and
03:08
this is a place where miracles happen
03:10
so when you feel the presence of the
03:12
Lord we like to say it like this just
03:14
reach out reach out and touch him and
03:17
receive your miracle tonight all right
03:23
it's been excited we were living in
03:27
supernatural times and this has been a
03:29
supernatural week I'm sure every
03:31
here knows that Paul Kane went to be
03:34
with the Lord last Tuesday evening and
03:36
today was the afternoon when his body
03:39
was laid to rest in Santa Maria and just
03:43
different the signs and wonders
03:44
happening throughout the week and and so
03:47
I know that we're in the midst but we're
03:50
always in the midst of the supernatural
03:51
but it just seems like something special
03:53
and so we invited Kat a while ago and of
03:56
course nobody but God knew that Paul was
03:59
gonna go home and actually be buried on
04:01
the first day when she's speaking and I
04:03
know that it's not a coincidence I don't
04:05
know exactly what it means maybe she
04:07
does but I know stuff like that is not
04:10
just a coincidence so we're really
04:12
blessed and honored Kat to have you here
04:15
again and I'm sure how many of you have
04:17
never been in a live cat care meeting Oh
04:20
a lot of you good you're in for a treat
04:22
so why don't you can make your way up
04:25
Kat you need to come up around this way
04:26
and yeah you ready oh and while she's
04:32
coming up somebody dropped their glasses
04:34
so if that's you you probably can't see
04:36
but here they are when I put them up
04:42
here so Kat
04:43
um well brought those in you don't know
04:46
the Lord's been taking her to heaven for
04:48
several years and showing her things and
04:50
bringing her back and allowing her to
04:51
share with us so let's just welcome cat
04:54
Kirk
04:54
[Applause]
05:00
Wow
05:02
[Applause]
05:06
I know some people know why I'm saying
05:12
that some may not when the army of
05:16
heaven goes to battle against the
05:18
darkness that is their war cry why
05:25
because they're excited you're gonna
05:28
crush the enemy's plans over you right
05:30
they're gonna crush them they're gonna
05:33
pull down strongholds that have been
05:35
rising against you that's why they were
05:38
created news flash from heaven they
05:41
weren't created to protect heaven they
05:45
were made by the creator of heaven they
05:48
didn't get to kick Lucifer and one-third
05:51
of the angels out then you get to do
05:52
that
05:53
Michael hell them and the Father sent a
05:56
lightning bolt a million megawatts of
05:58
love from himself and took him out and
06:01
then one third of angels went out the
06:04
same way so they've been waiting a long
06:07
time to war on our behalf full time amen
06:13
I may or may not give you scripture for
06:16
that tonight go look it up I think most
06:20
of us know that Jesus was the lord of
06:24
state loud the host is the name of the
06:30
army of heaven yes they're still part of
06:32
the angel tribes but they're different
06:35
in many ways the ones under Gabriel have
06:40
many different positions and jobs in
06:43
heaven and on the earth and they look
06:46
more like us
06:47
they're the ones who look more like us
06:48
the army of heaven mostly does not look
06:51
anything like us they're creatures most
06:53
of them are creatures they're fierce
06:55
looking they're not gonna be pretty boys
06:57
with harps so what the Holy Spirit says
07:02
they're not gonna be pretty boys with
07:04
harps however there was one time when
07:08
they had to take the place of the
07:10
worship angels which were the one-third
07:12
that were kicked out the only ones
07:15
Lucifer got were the ones he was over he
07:17
was over one-third of the angels
07:18
was the worship angels obviously if he
07:22
was the one who led them in worship all
07:24
the time in heaven I'm just gonna give
07:27
you full out Revelation because I want
07:29
to take advantage of all the time I have
07:31
so if you didn't know this he used to
07:33
step inside God to lead worship he
07:36
covered over the very heart of God with
07:38
his wings which were embellished with
07:40
gems he had gems on his back on his
07:43
front people go well he had just a few
07:45
no he had really hundreds of them on him
07:48
and when God made him he made mountings
07:51
like in a ring and every gem was mounted
07:54
and amounting like a ring that you would
07:56
wear like this one here and he was
07:58
beautiful which is one of the reasons
08:00
why he ended up by falling from pride
08:02
from his beauty also he thought he was
08:05
smarter than God and that was a that was
08:08
busted mythbuster it's okay to laugh cuz
08:18
you're gonna laugh a lot tonight
08:19
alright heaven laughs every time the
08:23
devil loses down here all of heaven
08:25
roars yes they know what's going on and
08:29
today they were attendants for Paul Cain
08:33
with Paul Cain not talking about the
08:37
body talk about his spirit man everyone
08:42
gets to see their own homecoming isn't
08:44
that nice
08:45
so we're colors and play lots of music
08:48
and dance because that's what they'll be
08:51
doing in heaven news flash from heaven
08:54
number two they don't have a funeral in
08:56
heaven when you come home say Amen you
09:01
shouldn't expect one we should have a
09:04
party zone down here when we send people
09:07
off instead of a funeral home someone
09:09
opened a party zone I promise you'll
09:11
make more money than other people with
09:12
funeral homes cuz even the world will
09:14
want to send theirs off wherever they
09:15
think they're going they'll pick a party
09:19
anybody say Amen so that is a witty idea
09:24
I've been giving up for years I don't
09:25
think anybody's done it yet so there you
09:27
go the more real heaven becomes to the
09:32
body of
09:33
people will want to send them off with a
09:35
real celebration because of the reality
09:40
of what heaven is and what they're going
09:41
to be experiencing there it won't make
09:43
sense to have a sad funeral while
09:47
they're watching from the party I'm a
09:51
seer that means I see in the unseen
09:57
realm okay mister
10:01
I'm really happy Danny because I got to
10:04
experience all that heaven was doing and
10:06
what was going on with Paul Kane and his
10:09
mother and his sisters you know his
10:11
family that's up there and the others
10:14
who were attending up there watching his
10:16
service he enjoyed every funny thing
10:19
that was told he likes to be real so he
10:22
liked all the reality of who he was he
10:24
liked that personal side of him being
10:27
talked about so next time you plan a
10:30
family members homegoing service tell
10:33
some jokes because they will laugh I was
10:39
at a service one time and back home and
10:42
it was um trying to member the guys name
10:45
I remember told McClellan he was part of
10:47
story side B and he died suddenly and I
10:52
came into his service I didn't know
10:54
anyone but I was coming to bring some
10:56
books about heaven to his family the
10:57
Holy Spirit told me to and I saw him
11:00
watching from the portal that was really
11:03
difficult you know to try to pretend to
11:06
be sad and I never wear black it's okay
11:12
if you if you go to somewhere where
11:13
they're expecting you know to do what is
11:15
proper not to upset them but no one's
11:19
wearing black in heaven they're not and
11:22
they aren't having to partying there was
11:25
I saw Ron McClellan thank you my best
11:27
friend Holy Spirit he makes up for what
11:30
I don't know you know helps my human
11:34
head lots of times
11:35
because they kind of took that away from
11:37
me I used to be kind of brilliant
11:40
really then they made me like eight
11:42
years old
11:43
life is much easier being that way you
11:46
know what you don't worry about things
11:48
you don't think about what's gonna
11:49
happen five years down the road when you
11:51
don't even know or you already planned
11:54
you know prepare for disasters or
11:55
something I never got that really if
11:58
we're over the weather then we shouldn't
11:59
be concerned about the weather we rule
12:02
over it amen
12:03
okay she didn't know news bulletins
12:06
number three writes number three are you
12:07
keeping track you're gonna get a gift
12:11
number three
12:13
Jesus was over the weather we are joint
12:18
ears we get to be over the weather and
12:20
that great you're gonna see that more
12:23
and more I'm serious you're gonna see it
12:25
more and more things stop like stop
12:27
can't wait for that to happen
12:30
meteorologists might have to get another
12:32
job not making fake news by the way
12:37
they don't work now and it's not gonna
12:39
work when it's not actually happening
12:41
what was I talking about
12:46
number three boys over over the weather
12:52
Jesus was over the weather and he tried
12:54
so hard to teach his disciples he really
12:56
was in case you didn't know they were in
12:58
boot camp with him for three years it
13:01
wasn't just watch what I do
13:03
it's learn what I do and then do it
13:06
right he was gonna go he's gonna go back
13:09
for some R&R and he had to make sure
13:13
they understood how this whole thing
13:14
works being a joint heir with Christ
13:17
what do you have we have he said so
13:19
himself the things I did how point-blank
13:22
can you get the things and the works I
13:25
have done you will do well you forgot
13:30
the first part you will do also okay
13:34
these are just the works you got to do
13:36
the works say we got to do the works
13:40
then we get to do the greater say it
13:44
louder okay like you're excited well I
13:50
don't just try things I actually do them
13:54
there's a difference I'm just gonna try
13:57
that means you're not making much of a
13:59
plan about that right but doing it the
14:05
works I did you will do they do also and
14:11
greater works you will do I think that
14:18
means we're socially doing something
14:22
we're entering into a busy season a busy
14:26
season operating in the supernatural not
14:29
just talking about it a busy season
14:32
handling the wealth of the wicked not
14:34
just talking about it a busy season
14:38
living not just existing doing the more
14:43
say the more the more is amazing are you
14:49
getting better I am just as passionate
14:56
about living holy as I am about being
15:00
funny and I will tell you I I have to I
15:04
have to give you both sides of heaven
15:07
there's two sides in heaven there's holy
15:10
profound the other whole half of heaven
15:13
is funny say funny everybody have
15:19
they've thought for ever and for ages
15:22
that it would be boring in heaven maybe
15:24
because all they do is worship let me
15:27
tell you you stand in front of him it's
15:28
not boring
15:30
whether you're staring feeling like
15:33
you're going to faint melting to the
15:34
ground you know you feel like you don't
15:37
have breath in you because of just being
15:39
near him yeah it is an honor a privilege
15:42
and amazing when you worship and it's
15:44
not normal not even worship as normal in
15:48
heaven you ride on it you create things
15:53
as you're worshiping him you're creating
15:56
when you worship given the devil a big
16:00
black eye and a very bad day when you
16:04
worship Him you are shredding bashing
16:07
and crushing his fake little wannabe
16:09
Kingdom
16:10
in the second heaven when you worship
16:12
Him it's amazing from doing one thing
16:17
for him to honor him to bless him to
16:21
adore him
16:22
what destruction you do against the
16:24
kingdom of darkness that's my favorite
16:27
second thing I don't do demons I do do
16:34
Jesus though I love him I honor him I
16:38
can't do anything without him it's
16:40
because of him and with him and it is
16:43
his plan even the pink hair is his plan
16:47
because he's not boring there's nothing
16:51
boring about him there's absolutely
16:53
nothing boring about heaven there's
16:55
nothing boring about our future
16:58
that's like in the next few days the
17:03
more you believe things are real the
17:06
more real they will become and that is
17:10
actually a spiritual truth it's a spirit
17:13
realm truth the more you believe it is
17:15
real and talk about it being real and
17:18
write about it being real and actually
17:20
acting in it being real the more real
17:23
it's going to become to you it's the
17:26
original realm it's the eternal realm
17:29
it's not the temporary realm this is a
17:32
temporary life for you
17:33
it's a temporary place to live a
17:36
temporary to do things because this
17:38
earth is not eternal I know people have
17:41
worked it out in their own mind with
17:43
their head research and they're looking
17:45
up stuff and sometimes assuming because
17:49
I've read a lot of translations and
17:51
someone kind of miss it I know because
17:54
the Holy Spirit shows me those
17:55
scriptures then he'll show me 30
17:58
scriptures of it being translated I take
18:04
the word for the value it gives it's
18:07
real it is for us to repair us to
18:12
accelerate us to propel us into high
18:15
places you never dreamed of doing things
18:18
you never dreamed of we are living
18:21
examples of the
18:23
Father Son and Holy Spirit on this earth
18:26
that's why you're here you here to be
18:29
like them look like them and act like
18:32
them I don't see any failure in any of
18:36
that I don't see hopelessness
18:38
worthlessness I don't see fear at all
18:43
one of the first things the Holy Spirit
18:45
gives me these Kingdom quotes it's what
18:47
we decided to call him there's so many
18:49
we don't know what to call and we didn't
18:50
just say a quote the Holy Spirit is a
18:52
Kingdom quote was don't let fear
18:55
interfere that was a good one right
19:00
teach me never to fear never say never
19:03
at all in any way fear does not control
19:09
our life we do not partner with fear he
19:12
didn't put fear in us when he made us
19:16
we're supposed to be fearless and
19:21
timeless everybody should be yelling I
19:24
receive it say timeless we're supposed
19:31
to be timeless he said you had to die
19:38
I'm being serious not funny now serious
19:42
John didn't have to die did he say no
19:52
didn't Jesus say to the disciples what
19:55
is it so in other words he's saying it
19:56
doesn't matter what they think
19:58
you probably actually said that he's a
20:01
character he's the son of God but he is
20:04
a character the problem with the biggest
20:06
characters in heaven except for Holy
20:07
Spirit Holy Spirit has gotten beat by by
20:09
that much who they called the drama King
20:14
Jesus is the king of kings Holy Spirit
20:19
is a drama King you haven't only seen
20:22
just a little bit of his activity so far
20:24
waiting to the full fledge release on
20:27
this earth
20:30
he's excited he's excited about what's
20:34
about to happen in us they've been
20:37
waiting a long time say they've been
20:38
waiting a long time if I say the word
20:42
day I mean the Trinity they're not
20:46
boring
20:47
none of them they know how to step
20:50
inside of each other and be one one
20:52
thing that's how it happens I know I was
20:56
eight years old father caught me up
20:59
before the throne and said I'm going to
21:00
show you how the three can be one and a
21:03
five-year-old can understand that man's
21:05
head knowledge has expanded it and
21:08
expanded it and all kind of could use
21:10
every other kind of word explaining that
21:12
you know multiply it whatever you want
21:13
to call it made it look amazing powerful
21:15
and hard to understand it's simple they
21:21
can step inside of each other Jesus said
21:24
father I pray that one day that they be
21:27
one even as we are one because he steps
21:31
inside his father all the time when he
21:35
was the word he did the same thing I
21:37
didn't forget I was only on number three
21:40
bulletins by the way I've got some more
21:41
I was the least likely person to anyone
21:49
on this earth would have chosen to do
21:50
this okay I'm from a tribe like a real
21:54
one 15 people in an alligator and an
21:59
iguana innumerable amount of toad frogs
22:02
and lizards and spiders we grew up with
22:06
them in our home I had seven brothers
22:10
what did you think in Florida
22:12
you add that up that's what that comes
22:14
to sell your bike to some kid for a pig
22:17
bring him home wrap him up and close and
22:19
you have a new pet overnight we never
22:23
knew what was going to be in our home so
22:26
I didn't need anyone's opinions I was
22:29
never part of a group or a clique I had
22:30
a tribe God did that to kill me I'm a
22:35
dead person standing before you dead
22:39
people are wonderful for God to use
22:42
they're not full of self they don't have
22:46
their own opinion and the devil cannot
22:49
use a dead person the more dead you are
22:54
to yourself the more dangerous you are
22:57
against hell there are many ways to kill
23:02
me
23:03
before I even grew up and you know it
23:06
doesn't matter I mean I love everyone in
23:08
this room I loved all my siblings I
23:10
survived I conquered I was a leader
23:13
wasn't liked all the time but I was a
23:18
big help to my parents I honor my
23:20
parents greatly every day of my life I
23:22
loved them I didn't want to hurt them
23:26
they needed help say parents they need
23:31
help pastors they need more help
23:39
I'm grateful people can start a church
23:41
Oh No I've already died I don't need a
23:45
church I don't need a whole
23:47
congregations of people although I love
23:50
them I bless you all but I really bless
23:53
the pastor because they die every day to
23:58
be that amen
24:00
you'll notice that God didn't actually
24:04
send his son to be a pastor did you ever
24:07
notice that they actually sent him as a
24:10
businessman
24:11
God loves business people they're easy
24:14
they know how to listen they know how to
24:17
complete things that are given to them
24:19
they don't leave things out forget
24:20
things ignore things they do a job amen
24:24
so he sent his son as a businessman who
24:26
could easily connect with the sinners
24:30
and he did they ate with him all the
24:34
time they liked him he was exciting he
24:38
was interesting he was funny his
24:42
favorite job was to offend the hierarchy
24:47
he was good at it
24:50
and yet lived holy did miracles raise
24:54
the dead they took money from people for
24:57
spotted lambs they weren't high on God's
25:01
list and he had to train his disciples I
25:12
know he only had him for three years and
25:15
I think most of them finally got it
25:17
after he left but they did give him
25:21
credit they did but in the beginning I'm
25:25
sure Jesus would go to the Father when
25:27
he went to the mountain all the time and
25:28
say are you sure I have to that fight
25:33
all the time
25:34
they brawl over women I have one who
25:38
wants to be everything until everybody
25:40
that that would be Peter I have a
25:43
treasure you know that cheats all the
25:45
time right you know that you know he
25:48
takes money all the time I know you know
25:50
that too
25:51
and I have a tax collector and every
25:53
time you walk down the road to go
25:55
Minister we get stones thrown at us
25:56
because they don't like him I don't know
25:59
anybody who likes tax clusters they
26:01
didn't back then either so he did not
26:05
give him the best or the easiest to
26:08
Train and I know I was saying something
26:12
to God about my some of my staff and he
26:16
said I didn't make it easy for my son in
26:18
my conversation ended with that subject
26:22
especially when he caught me up me took
26:24
me back and I got to walk through a
26:26
whole day of their lives
26:28
like in their first year of being
26:30
together all right God I can make it God
26:38
has a plan for you every single person
26:41
is important to him and I do know this
26:44
your birth was timed on this earth God
26:50
created time he knew you before you were
26:53
born because you played inside of him he
26:56
saw you if there was time he saw you all
27:00
the time how great is
27:03
see that he was huge he could make
27:05
himself as big as he wanted to and he
27:07
walked on the mountains he was out where
27:10
there was nothing and he spoke and the
27:12
world would step out of him and make
27:13
space that God would make himself small
27:21
enough to step inside himself and play
27:23
with you he did say he's not a man he's
27:32
God and even being that great he knew
27:36
everything about you knew the mistakes
27:40
knew our faults knew everything that had
27:43
great hope and great plans for you to do
27:47
great things so it's no mistake you're
27:49
here now in this age instead of the ages
27:53
before this time you're here right on
27:55
time for the accelerator time for the
27:59
more of God for the kingdom age for the
28:05
time to command the hosts of heaven
28:07
handle the wealth by host cities for him
28:12
to use because he's not poor he knows
28:18
the names of your children that you'll
28:20
have even before you get married he
28:22
knows them and he put them in your
28:25
family line on purpose in this
28:29
generation that's here now this is a
28:31
special generation for God it's the
28:34
beginning of the group and type of
28:36
people that will remain until all things
28:39
be fulfilled some well the Bible says
28:47
there'll be a group of people like that
28:48
a group and type of people a generation
28:51
that we're generation means a group and
28:54
type of people it doesn't mean like 30
28:56
years or actually that word in the Bible
28:59
that says Jesus says that there'll be a
29:03
group and Type O people on earth that
29:04
will be here when all things be
29:05
fulfilled including the coming of him
29:08
that word means a group and type of
29:11
people that work generation means that
29:14
there will be a grouping type of people
29:16
on this earth that also says in the
29:18
Bible that would taste of the powers say
29:21
powers of the age to come that would be
29:29
the Millennial age of course there's
29:32
people now let's say they're not going
29:33
to be in millennium I go about what the
29:37
Bible says there will be a millennium
29:40
there will be a Tribulation God caused a
29:43
bump in the road it will happen that's
29:48
on his timeline in heaven so no matter
29:53
what other people have come come up with
29:55
or assume or have putting in
29:56
translations I promise you it's going to
29:59
happen and you can't make it happen or
30:01
not happen anyway so to me it's not
30:02
worth agreeing over God's gonna work out
30:06
his plan all the way to the end right
30:09
I'm excited to know that I'm part of
30:12
that generation that will tasted the
30:14
powers of the age to come
30:16
that's why you need revelation because
30:21
that that all that comes from the heart
30:24
of God he already knows what it's going
30:27
to look like she knows what's gonna
30:28
happen
30:29
so he chose you to be here to be a part
30:32
say Amen that word means so be yet might
30:39
as well say it gonna happen there's no
30:43
one on the earth in the earth around the
30:47
earth say it's round I gotta say that
30:50
the Holy Spirit won't let it go okay so
30:54
that's him say the earth is round not
30:59
flat they don't have edges you may say
31:03
that property does not have edges there
31:05
you go
31:06
Holy Spirit truck can we use proper
31:08
grammar Ben m8 that's how they say it
31:14
there is a whole group of people that
31:16
sincerely spend so much time and money
31:20
to try to prove the earth is flat I'd
31:23
rather use that money in that time and
31:24
energy ruling
31:26
right I've flown many times and I didn't
31:31
get halfway around the world then all of
31:32
a sudden here's the flat earth and I'm
31:35
flying it didn't all of a sudden go wait
31:36
shh now you're on the other side no I
31:40
went around besides I've already been up
31:44
over the earth it's round
31:48
God made it round he says he sits on the
31:52
circle of the earth not the square you'd
31:58
be surprised how serious they are they
32:02
think NASA has spent billions of dollars
32:04
faking it and none of that stuff is real
32:08
I don't know who got that thought but it
32:11
didn't come from heaven a man so just
32:17
rest assured that it's around okay been
32:21
there seen that it is round and when I
32:24
almost shown it God caught me up in
32:25
space up and do like like first space
32:28
not I've been way up there but the first
32:30
time he caught me up and showed me the
32:32
earth he put a grid you know like a grid
32:35
you know what that is yeah a grid was
32:38
round and he put it right on the earth
32:40
cheol-ho together and then they begin to
32:42
draw things on this grid that was his
32:45
plan that was called space planning that
32:47
was also the Holy Spirit's joke he's out
32:50
in space put the grid than planned right
32:53
uses every opportunity to be funny so he
32:58
did show me his space planning for like
33:01
the next hundred years that was probably
33:06
15 20 years ago when he showed me that
33:09
that doesn't mean the earth is going to
33:12
end in a hundred years
33:13
except been taken further than that and
33:16
no tribulation had happened I know some
33:20
people think it's supposed to be right
33:21
now well if it was it would be people
33:26
get to heaven they all find out man we
33:29
wasted so much time sitting on our
33:30
rapture rug
33:36
she to roll it up put it in the closet
33:43
well you've you've been around a long
33:45
time you realize I went to church
33:48
everyday it was open and every day
33:51
someone said Jesus could come tomorrow
33:54
and in my I'm like little this is like
33:57
little I had these thoughts why would he
34:00
have all these plans in the Bible and go
34:02
okay not forget that we're just all
34:03
going home I mean he gave my dad a long
34:08
plan I mean my dad knew him he gave him
34:11
a long plan I mean he's not going to
34:12
where we haven't done what God told us
34:14
to do yet
34:15
and God said well many people are in
34:18
fear and they know one day that will
34:21
happen so they want it to come so to
34:24
them that's logical they don't
34:25
understand a lot especially in the book
34:27
of Revelation say revelations means
34:31
revelations that means something you
34:35
don't know so God said I'm calling you a
34:39
Revelator me you know why he did that so
34:41
people couldn't call me a false prophet
34:43
they don't know what a Revelator is so
34:45
they didn't never say nothing against it
34:50
they couldn't say well she's not a
34:54
terrible pastor no he can't call an
34:57
evangelist she doesn't go out and win
34:58
lots of millions we can't call her that
34:59
huh can't call her prophet she's a
35:03
Revelator don't know what that is so
35:04
we'll ignore all of that a Revelator is
35:10
someone who reveals like John did caught
35:14
up showing the future the future no know
35:17
what that was that was a bling glitch
35:19
write that down and don't forget it I
35:21
know Jen is writing it down right now if
35:25
I say word she goes you did a bling
35:26
glitch that means you blended some words
35:28
together okay I won't explain it yes
35:35
you've been there I'm sure people been
35:37
there right you've been there well at
35:40
least I'm not talking about noses
35:42
putting the animals on the art tonight
35:44
that's Moses and Noah doing it together
35:50
when Donna even said Adam did it I did
35:55
hear from people I have a bloopers thing
36:00
one day and just put them all on there
36:01
go there and look at it but now I forget
36:07
we're talking about who is listening
36:12
Revelator you're right so see I hear
36:22
them all the time I have to fight when
36:25
you're eight you need help so he didn't
36:31
pick me to be a professor you know I was
36:34
graduated middle of my class like
36:37
literally middle we had six hundred
36:40
graduating students we have a lot of
36:43
people coming to Florida to go to school
36:45
I guess they like it we're pretty
36:47
laid-back there you know and so it's a
36:51
nice place to live if you want to come
36:52
live someplace different go good
36:55
vacation time try not to come in August
37:00
really hot so being a Revelator's a
37:07
little bit different that usually
37:09
doesn't mean profit just so you've
37:10
wondered you know John was a men and
37:16
it's okay I love doing that but I love
37:20
being with my father my heavenly father
37:24
him all the time I know why Jesus loved
37:29
him so much I know why he wanted to be
37:31
with him I know why he went away to the
37:33
mountain to spend time with him I know
37:36
how hard it was for him to leave home
37:37
and come here okay he was not poor he
37:42
didn't live poor say Jesus was not poor
37:48
he became poor when he left heaven
37:52
because heaven is certainly not poor
37:56
there's nothing poor up there nothing
38:00
splendor and wandering beauty you
38:03
couldn't afford to build the house that
38:05
you're mentioned that your mother lives
38:07
in you wouldn't even have the right
38:10
substances to make it the walls sing
38:15
literally they sing they leave you go on
38:18
tours come back they sing hello to them
38:21
the trees uproot their self and they
38:23
come and sit in your house and be your
38:27
friend for a while they'll go back to
38:29
the friendly forest is this ok it's not
38:36
gonna be normal no you can't be normal
38:41
you've been going to heaven for 20 years
38:43
you be normal to heaven they tell funny
38:48
stories a lot Bob Jones hasn't stopped
38:57
most people when they go there no matter
38:59
how they were here they're all happy
39:01
they love jokes they love to tell funny
39:03
stories hear funny stories they love it
39:06
they make plans for people before they
39:08
come they knew Paul was coming they all
39:15
knew Paul is coming there's a place you
39:19
go in heaven where you find that out and
39:24
you go in this beautiful amazing
39:26
building and these supernatural monitors
39:29
much better than ours but these are good
39:32
and you can see who's coming home who's
39:35
about to come home to heaven everybody
39:37
starts getting things ready they're so
39:38
excited they're there beside their self
39:40
they want to make sure they're all there
39:42
say all to meet you at the gate they
39:48
have a huge celebration they plan one
39:51
themselves heaven plans one the throne
39:53
room plans one people have celebrations
39:56
in the street over someone coming home
39:59
stay home it's because that's where you
40:03
came from we were alone to the earth for
40:07
a while when you go home
40:09
you are really home and you're not dead
40:13
they don't throw parties for people who
40:16
aren't alive they have huge celebrations
40:21
lots of music lots of food everyone
40:25
meeting one another
40:26
visiting Jesus welcomes you if he isn't
40:31
taking you himself sometimes he does
40:34
take people he comes into his own
40:35
chariot flaming horses picks you up and
40:38
takes you up to heaven then when you get
40:42
out you see the sea or the mass of
40:44
people waiting to greet you and then
40:49
Jesus walks you up the steps of the
40:51
throne to give you back to the Father
40:54
and then the father reaches out of that
40:58
glory that moves in and out of him the
41:01
Living colors of the bow coming in and
41:04
out his eyes flames of fire passion for
41:07
you just glowing and he reaches his arms
41:11
out and grabs you he says welcome home
41:14
my son welcome home my daughter you go
41:17
home as his children say we are his
41:20
offspring every morning gets their own
41:24
mansion you don't have to share it with
41:27
your brother or sister I'll have my own
41:31
one day it's made exactly the way you
41:37
would love it but it's made with his
41:40
presence in the walls and the floors and
41:42
it's not gonna be a normal shape trust
41:45
me it's not all your pets to be there
41:47
they'll be waiting to greet you eating
41:51
your food at your table your family
41:59
members will all have gifts for you for
42:01
every year you've been apart they will
42:03
get a gift that represents that year and
42:05
put it in your mansion after your
42:08
welcome home party in the throne room
42:10
which could last for quite a while
42:13
your family will come get you and take
42:16
you to your own mansion then they'll
42:17
have another celebration
42:22
everybody laughs and filled with joy to
42:27
see all the ones they loved before
42:29
little tiny babies they never got to
42:31
raise they get their children given to
42:33
them to raise the same one that you that
42:37
didn't make it all the way through amen
42:41
God keeps them they live with your
42:44
grandparents or whoever when they get
42:46
there they'll go get them and help raise
42:48
them for a while I love the story of a
42:51
mother they lost their son he was either
42:55
7 or 8 he was hit by a car and they of
42:59
course they they grieved over him but
43:01
knew he was in heaven and I think it was
43:03
like 20 years later or 30 years later
43:05
one of the other huh
43:06
she died on the operating table and was
43:10
caught up to heaven saw her
43:12
seven-year-old son playing in the
43:15
streets of gold he goes mom Wow mom
43:18
you're here this is so exciting
43:20
your mom I'm so glad you're here and you
43:22
cuz what have you been doing goes I've
43:24
been playing with my friends what you
43:25
think I've been doing he's been living
43:29
with his grandfather and playing with
43:31
all these friends and the streets to go
43:33
they were playing and he was laughing
43:35
and he said but you can't come yet
43:37
because it's not your time
43:38
and so she came back never forgot it and
43:43
her and her husband went around the
43:45
world talking about it you will be known
43:48
as you are known except you look better
43:53
like a whole lot better you'll have hair
44:01
most guys wear their hair about down to
44:04
their shoulders don't have you know
44:06
that's gonna change y'all I'm just
44:08
letting you know I can't change guys
44:10
unless you really want like a buzz cut
44:13
or something no Marine Corps or my
44:18
husband may still have one I would might
44:20
be surprised to see him alive yeah he's
44:25
still with me by the way another way to
44:26
kill me but that was okay
44:34
it's all worth everything it's worth it
44:40
all no matter what you surrender give up
44:44
miss doing it's worth it and you'll be
44:49
so happy when you stand before God and
44:52
you're welcomed home knowing that you
44:55
gave everything you could not saying you
44:58
have to walk around poor okay that was
45:00
the devil's plan not God's his plan is
45:04
to bless us say bless us and prosper us
45:10
it'll be worth it some people have
45:13
already seen Jesus here right how many
45:15
people have seen Jesus let me see either
45:18
in a vision or dream or in reality if
45:20
you've seen him how many people have
45:22
been encountered an angel there's
45:24
usually a lot there's a lot of people
45:26
here it's going to happen that's part of
45:28
the acceleration that's part of the more
45:31
it's a lot of them more actually that we
45:35
will see angels and they will probably
45:37
be talking to us they came from God
45:41
ignore what we've all been told our
45:42
whole lives don't talk to angels they
45:46
did in the Bible amen
45:49
there's gonna be a lot more of that
45:51
angelic not just visitation because what
45:55
we're going to experience is the
45:56
habitation heavens not coming for a
45:59
visit a heaven
46:01
is not coming for a visit they're coming
46:04
for a habitation you're part of the
46:09
habitation you are all of you sitting
46:11
here say I'm alive and breathing I'm
46:15
part of the habitation but God is about
46:22
to do on this earth does not just take a
46:25
territory here and there what the
46:28
habitation will be is in us say in us
46:34
that's the part of the habitation that's
46:36
why me and won't be able to control it
46:38
like they have in the past say God will
46:42
be in charge
46:45
it's a habitation and it will remain for
46:49
a long time he's gonna transform this
46:53
world right now he is shifting
46:55
government so he can shape Nations it's
47:04
part of the platform he's giving us in
47:06
the habitation
47:07
he's got platforms for us that's the
47:12
place that we will operate from and
47:14
speak from shake things cause things to
47:19
be released to change for him it's not a
47:26
lot of how it's always been in the past
47:28
that's why it's a new thing say a new
47:30
thing it's time for the new thing it's
47:37
where we will be ruling it's one of the
47:40
purposes that Christ died for us that's
47:43
why he went into hell and wasted it took
47:47
back the authority and Dominion the Adam
47:49
had given away he gave it to us he also
47:54
gave his power over all the power of the
47:57
enemy say we have power over all the
48:03
power of the enemy say he did not give
48:10
that to the Angels that's why we need to
48:16
command them they can't just go tear up
48:20
any demon they see they just can't do
48:23
that
48:23
they do it in in the past it was from
48:25
answers to prayer and prayers never
48:27
going to go away it's never gonna go
48:29
away
48:30
he loves prayer prayer is powerful it's
48:33
gonna get even more powerful especially
48:37
when you command part of an army of
48:38
heaven and they pull down strongholds
48:41
for you and crush the plains of darkness
48:46
we need this say we need it
48:49
to rule in this day say every King gets
48:55
the Kingdom and gets an army if we're
48:59
part of the kingdom we get part of the
49:03
army did you ever see a king a natural
49:08
King on this earth title rule with that
49:09
one they wouldn't go very far with a
49:13
they'd be overrun beaten up things
49:17
stolen things killed someone's like the
49:20
devil he comes to kill steal and destroy
49:30
that's what the army prevents heavens
49:35
army was designed created and made every
49:38
one of them unique and different but
49:42
they are fierce they have one job the
49:47
ones under Gabriel have many different
49:49
jobs many different positions to do many
49:52
different things but but Michael is over
49:56
one specific part and that is the army
50:00
they have a headquarters they have
50:02
barracks they have training fields
50:05
they're all in the sky of heaven Rand
50:08
maneuvers for ages in the past Jesus
50:12
would go send up Michael to gather the
50:15
army from the far ends of heaven to
50:18
fight on behalf of Israel people say
50:20
Amen
50:20
it's in the Bible go read it sometimes
50:25
they even fought the flesh did you know
50:27
that yeah some of them could fight the
50:30
flesh in this time on earth it's mostly
50:36
battles in the spirit battling the
50:39
demonic even those in the high places
50:42
the principalities and the powers the
50:46
things the beings in wickedness in high
50:48
places many of those high places will be
50:51
shredded and pulled down say our weapons
50:58
they are mighty to the pulling down of
51:03
strongholds that's one of the things the
51:07
army does I can only share what I have
51:13
been told and I can only tell you what I
51:16
have been shown shown and told that's
51:21
what I talk about but they didn't just
51:24
show me things and tell me things I had
51:26
to live it every way something mom is
51:29
trained in it was for the body of Christ
51:32
so I had to live it to let you know it's
51:36
real and it really does work she follow
51:39
heavens protocol see on earth as it is
51:44
in heaven
51:45
that's what we've been asking for for
51:49
generations we should have expected it
51:56
jesus bushwhacked us all he did he told
52:01
me is it I knew if I taught them that
52:03
and said you say that eventually it
52:06
would come you mean one thing I could
52:10
get them to agree on no matter what
52:14
denomination they rod to clear that
52:17
prayer because they need us to call
52:21
things in is that right you have not
52:27
because you ask not
52:31
if you've ever said to Jesus I'll give
52:34
you anything you want no matter what it
52:36
is where it is what time it is I give
52:39
you permission to use me as anyone ever
52:41
says something like that let me see your
52:44
hands
52:45
well I'll get ready because he's calling
52:51
in those words yes it's gonna be amazing
52:56
say amazing heaven is amazing it's gonna
53:01
be amazing here we can live on earth
53:04
like they live in heaven which is mainly
53:08
his will being done
53:11
his way say his way not our way that's
53:18
part of the more she's gonna do new
53:21
thing he goes revelation and then ways
53:25
for you to use that revelation it means
53:28
a lot of things are gonna change so if
53:31
you're stuck in your own mind or your
53:33
own mindset of what you think is gonna
53:35
happen and because it didn't it's not
53:37
going to you need to just so that away
53:40
because he does have a timeline in his
53:44
own throne room and those dots on that
53:47
timeline is when his things are going to
53:50
happen regardless of what anybody on the
53:54
earth is doing it's his sovereign will
53:57
and what right now this time we're in
54:00
it's on his timeline it is many of the
54:04
generals are going home doesn't mean
54:07
they'll be oblivious to what we're doing
54:10
that means they'll know all about it
54:12
after they get there and the thing
54:13
they'll be celebrating is us who are
54:15
still down here being a part of it so
54:21
God really needs us right now he's
54:34
intimidating me although I probably
54:36
would have never chosen except when he
54:40
asked me I said yes say it's important
54:44
to say yes to being chosen many are
54:50
called but few are chosen because they
54:55
don't choose that's why many aren't
54:59
chosen he can't make you do it right
55:04
you're called you're being called but he
55:07
can't make you do that you have to
55:09
choose yes and when you do that you're
55:11
saying yes I want to be chosen and then
55:14
you're chosen what does it take to be
55:15
chosen say choose yes
55:21
then you got to be willing he makes it a
55:23
little bit you know gotta be willing and
55:25
obedient say willing obedience next say
55:35
surrender is not control a lot of people
55:42
think it is because you know God does
55:45
have he does have I'm trying to think of
55:52
the natural earthward it's like not
55:54
there he does have guidelines is that
56:00
right even Jesus had them that he
56:03
operated by Jesus didn't just pick
56:06
things on his own all the time where did
56:10
he say I do yeah what his father said
56:17
right but he showed him and what he told
56:20
him that's what he did that's why we
56:24
need revelation otherwise we're gonna
56:27
get man's mind set on everything and
56:30
that hasn't worked well has it he's not
56:36
going to abandon the church I've heard
56:39
all kinds of things when people's gonna
56:40
abandon the church it's just gonna go
56:42
away burn down we don't need it anymore
56:45
let's get rid of it when he's not saying
56:47
that to me he's going to set it on fire
56:52
amen this is a time to be willing and
56:56
obedient if you want to eat the fat of
56:59
the land and Jesus did ask us to pray
57:03
about one other thing pray that my
57:05
people say we are his people be willing
57:11
and the day of his power well obviously
57:16
if he's going to give us revelation to
57:18
operate like he does and part of that is
57:22
power
57:22
he says he'll give you power over all
57:25
the part of the enemy there's one right
57:26
there
57:26
he's given us power and he does have
57:31
power
57:33
so if this is the day of his power the
57:36
biggest thing the most important thing
57:37
is remember the willing and obedient
57:38
thing what he asked probably won't seem
57:42
natural or normal to you wasn't natural
57:46
normal to ask me to have pink hair I
57:49
wasn't a pink haired person I liked it
57:53
he wouldn't have asked me it's better
57:57
than camel hair I like pink here any day
58:02
over camel hair it smells it's stiff not
58:09
comfortable and he had to wrap himself
58:11
in it okay my pink hair is a test it
58:18
divides asunder the Spirit from the
58:21
flesh so those who trash or bash it or
58:26
in the flash are we still so walking the
58:30
flash say no we're supposed to walk in
58:35
the so people don't have to tell me if
58:40
they're hearing their flesh or hearing
58:42
their spirit it's the way they react to
58:45
the pink care now people who like pink
58:48
hair they think is amazing so the world
58:49
must be passing their tests because they
58:53
all love it that's amazing you look
58:56
amazing what do you do I'm a
58:59
spokesperson for haven't I've been there
59:02
and then they all say the same thing
59:05
they don't say you're liar your father's
59:07
property was that they go what was it
59:09
like what was it like is it beautiful is
59:14
it amazing is it real is is God real is
59:16
there a god and go oh yes there is a God
59:20
and you lived inside of him before you
59:22
came here okay that makes him interested
59:26
not bashing amen
59:30
try that next time you did live in him
59:36
you moved in and out of him he was your
59:39
very existence you had your very
59:40
existence in him that's why he knew you
59:43
that's why he saw you before he sent you
59:46
here you're wonderfully and perfectly
59:51
made your souls were the most amazing
59:54
parts of you of all you change your very
59:57
life by what you feed it you change how
60:01
you feel about things by what you say
60:04
yourself if you don't like you then
60:08
change change what you're saying change
60:12
what you're watching change what you let
60:14
other people say around you because you
60:16
need to guard your heart what goes in
60:20
there is what you will become
60:22
amen if you've never heard that before
60:26
it's Revelation on your soul your soul
60:28
is what you are people say well I'm
60:32
missing that no Adam became a living
60:36
Saint loud he became a living soul
60:43
that's how important it is to God that's
60:45
why he gave you a soul you could choose
60:47
yourself you could choose with your will
60:50
you can think about things choose it and
60:52
then you do it and then your emotions
60:56
display who and what you believe with
61:00
your life it's probably one of the least
61:03
talked about things in the church it's a
61:06
soul growing up I always heard that it
61:09
was bad and went but God made it right
61:13
he it's one third of us is that right
61:16
we'll always have our soul
61:18
why would he make it bad it's a powerful
61:22
thing and it's a good thing because you
61:25
can feel yourself with God and then
61:26
you'll be like him you can talk about
61:29
him then you really believe he is real
61:32
you can feed your soul 24 hours a day
61:36
your body gets fed a few times a day
61:39
your spirit man gets fed once a week
61:43
most people go to church once a week but
61:48
your souls fed all the time by what you
61:52
watch what you say what people say to
61:54
you you can be crushed by tragedies and
61:57
you can't you can't forget it you hang
61:59
on to it somebody
62:00
you wound and hurt eunuch stays there
62:02
forever your soul has layers and it
62:06
collects things in those layers that's
62:09
why you have a memory but your layers
62:12
are supposed to be used for different
62:13
something different than that every
62:16
layer of you looks like you who wants
62:19
revelation on the soul let me see your
62:20
hand I was shown one and the father
62:26
spent four hours with me earth time I
62:28
never usually know but I looked at my
62:30
clock and I was talking to him then he
62:32
just catches me up and begins to show me
62:35
a human soul what it look like how he
62:37
made it why did he make it that way how
62:39
people can cause her soul to prosper all
62:41
the time and then they live in divine
62:43
health there was a requirement about
62:47
that prospering it says even as your
62:51
soul prospers you will prosper and you
62:55
will be in health that where B means lib
62:59
it's called divine health so I since I
63:05
learned about the father taught me about
63:07
that he said people can loose with the
63:09
keys of the kingdom you can loose things
63:10
out of your soul when you loose it it's
63:13
gone
63:14
and that doesn't matter what it is he
63:17
started giving me this very long list of
63:19
things that you can loose from your soul
63:21
and he said I know most people buying
63:24
the devil but the keys to the kingdom
63:26
but they mostly never talked about the
63:29
loosing thing what are gonna do with the
63:30
loosing key and yet the binding key is
63:34
more important to bind the things of God
63:37
to your soul because then they can't be
63:38
taken away what you choose to bind to
63:43
your soul about God will never be taken
63:46
from you and so people I know you know
63:51
if you still want to bind the devil go
63:52
ahead and do it I'd rather loose the
63:56
stuff out of my soul that he tried
63:57
putting there you know if you have an
64:00
anger issue in your anger anger angry
64:02
all the time you don't even know you're
64:03
just angry it's all it comes out of you
64:05
it's in your soul you choose with your
64:08
will to loose that's that anger then
64:12
heaven comes down and they pull it out
64:14
saywhat sluiced on earth is loosed in
64:18
heaven you know how amazing you would be
64:22
if you didn't have all that junk in
64:23
there especially wounds and wounds can
64:28
keep you from the things of God as much
64:31
as sin can don't leave a wound in you
64:35
because then the enemy will come and try
64:37
to use it amen
64:40
so tomorrow night not tonight we're
64:43
gonna do a soul checkup I hope you're
64:47
coming who's coming tomorrow night hope
64:48
everybody's coming home you don't want
64:52
to miss tomorrow night this is just the
64:53
introduction we're gonna do some
64:57
spiritual warfare with the hosts they'll
65:01
be excited you mean leaving an army if
65:04
you don't have one they were made for us
65:08
amen they won't let you worship them
65:11
they don't have time for that and
65:14
neither do you
65:15
amen tomorrow night we're gonna have
65:19
some fire sent the Angels already
65:22
outside waiting but they're gonna do
65:24
that tomorrow night I did this recently
65:27
where I mean people were literally
65:28
flaming like they were flaming because
65:34
this is time just darkening I want to
65:37
say drops of it the fire of God is
65:41
amazing it comes from himself inside him
65:45
say our God is a consuming fire I'm
65:49
about to get consumed it's one of the
65:54
most asked asked things by the body of
65:56
Christ send the fire I want the fire
66:01
give me the fire let me be consumed let
66:03
me burn for you it burns everything off
66:07
the walls of your heart I mean literally
66:09
make sure your heart white you are
66:15
filled with boldness like you've never
66:16
had before in your life you're fearless
66:20
you're bold you you got filled with God
66:23
the fire it burns it out then he puts
66:28
him in
66:28
selves in there he heaps more stones of
66:31
fire inside of you those came from God
66:35
two stones a fire I find a one
66:39
translation said that they were they
66:41
were flaming stones that Satan left on
66:43
some other planet that was in a Bible
66:48
and I already knew what they were so God
66:51
made me look up like 29 different
66:53
translations to go see what they say it
66:54
is like they missed that one no they
66:59
didn't ever belong to Lucifer okay they
67:03
were inside God or he burns with this
67:07
fire for you under the water they burn
67:11
in the River of Life that's in him the
67:14
river flows out of him the gemstones
67:17
flow out of him even the steps of the
67:19
throne room have gemstones they flow out
67:22
of heaven and become the crystal see is
67:24
called the crystal see because there's
67:26
gemstones in it not sand
67:30
that's why it's cut crystal faceted
67:33
gemstones they're all over heaven they
67:36
all come from one place when the father
67:38
and the firewood burn inside of him and
67:41
Lucifer would step in and there's his
67:43
holy mountain inside God say God is not
67:47
a man he doesn't look the same inside
67:52
that we do but we lived there that's why
67:57
we like sparkly things way back in our
68:01
way back in our spirit man we remember
68:06
that we met we remember that there's
68:09
something that connects when we look at
68:11
something that's brilliant and beautiful
68:13
gemstones represent the love of God his
68:17
love his revelation upon this rock I
68:21
know he said Peter was a rock when God
68:24
says rock in the Bible he's talking
68:25
about a gemstone you know that white
68:29
rock that white rock rock or stone
68:31
you're gonna get when you go home to
68:32
heaven and there's a name under the only
68:34
he and you know it's a white diamond
68:37
it's not a River Rock
68:40
every syllabus I ever saw showed a river
68:43
rock when it talked about that that
68:46
stone so inside his eternity you never
68:52
see at the end there's no end inside of
68:56
him no end and we ran up and down this
69:00
mountain and we slid down the river of
69:02
life and would jump on the stones of
69:04
fire through the flames we lived in
69:07
those flames you're about to get
69:10
baptized with him it's amazing I don't
69:16
even know what time it is I better check
69:17
what time is it oh my my see gem she's
69:31
at it you didn't finish talking about
69:35
Ron McClellan remember I was at his
69:41
service right and I can I come in with
69:44
these books in his parents and
69:46
grandparents are sitting on the front
69:47
row I didn't know him so but I knew a
69:49
couple people there at celebration
69:51
Church they let me come in and I just
69:53
was going to wait till everything was
69:55
over and they were everybody with their
69:57
line going by the casket and he had this
70:01
bright yellow suit on I mean bright with
70:05
his big white tie and and he had the
70:07
biggest fro I've ever seen on a human
70:09
they had to stick it down in the casket
70:12
and as I was walking I was walking up I
70:17
looked up I was trying not to laugh out
70:21
loud because it was an open portal and
70:24
he was watching his service and now this
70:27
is a band right band in a van travelling
70:32
telling jokes non-stop doing sock
70:35
puppets you know crazy stuff he did
70:37
crazy things in the van with the guys
70:39
and his band was there and they were
70:42
telling the funniest stories and every
70:44
time they say something funny he would
70:45
go like this is here we go
70:53
so here I'm looking at the casket and
70:56
then I look up there
71:00
he was alive for now and there was a lot
71:02
of funny stories right so I'm like this
71:04
is just this crazy it was so much fun
71:06
and so I went back sat down and then it
71:10
came up when I gave out the books and I
71:13
didn't know who his parents were I knew
71:15
who his wife was and her mom dad were
71:17
there and I gave them one and I didn't
71:21
know that was his father sitting there
71:22
so I was telling you know his wife this
71:24
is a book about heaven I really think it
71:26
a bless you and I started to turn away
71:28
and and the Holy Spirit to tell me take
71:30
an extra one so of course willing and
71:32
obedient I had an extra one in a little
71:35
bag wondering who was gonna give it to
71:36
and he grabbed my arm II said did you
71:38
say that book was about heaven
71:40
I said yes I I've been there he says can
71:42
I have that book and I said yes yes you
71:45
can have and he goes well I'm Randstad
71:48
well was then this was for you because I
71:51
didn't know you were gonna be here but
71:53
he told me to bring it so this is your
71:55
book and a few months later I get a
71:57
phone call it's always in the middle of
71:59
night and it's his parents and they're
72:02
undone they were so full of joy in
72:04
celebration after reading about what
72:07
heaven was like they already knew what
72:09
their son would be doing having a band
72:10
and he does have a man and it's called
72:12
the other side of the story his heaven
72:17
he went from story side be to the other
72:20
side of the story that was his bayum but
72:23
in the band
72:24
angels were playing and singing with him
72:27
because he said he wouldn't let anyone
72:29
take the place of his band when they
72:31
came to heaven which I told their band
72:34
and so his parents called they were
72:37
really excited about everything and and
72:39
then I they gave me their daughter's
72:42
phone number he and his sister were
72:43
really close together and so I called
72:46
and just spoke to her for a few minutes
72:48
and and then about I don't know it was
72:50

73:08
she's on the phone to me God caught me
73:09
up to heaven and I saw her brother
73:13
standing at a portal
73:15
this goes sound wild but it didn't
73:17
matter he was throwing Cheetos at her
73:19
from the portal and he was singing the
73:24

about this but I got to tell you what
73:43
what I just saw in heaven I saw your
73:46
brother and he was throwing Cheetos over
73:49
the portal at you and she starts to yell
73:52
and scream she goes that that's she said
73:57
he even had a throw by he run by what do
74:02
you want a Cheeto throwing whatever he
74:04
had her fro to so he said his greatest
74:07
thing to do was run through the room and
74:10
throw as many Cheetos in her fro that
74:12
would stick there and she said he did it
74:16
all the time and I was so irritated but
74:17
now it's the most precious thing in the
74:19
world that you told me that because I
74:21
know he didn't forget me this is on her
74:23
birthday remember and I said oh I don't
74:25
know how to tell you this but he he
74:26
sounded the worst I have ever heard
74:29
for someone who's anointed to sing she
74:31
said was it the worst happy birthday you
74:33
ever heard in your life I want ya she
74:35
said he did that every year too so she
74:39
was so blessed to find out she that he
74:43
had not changed he still remembered her
74:46
he was still himself and she was so
74:50
blessed by that so now if Jen there Jen
74:53
I finished the story I'm done with okay
74:56
so I want to encourage you to understand
75:00
that your family still loves you no one
75:04
has forgotten you
75:06
they're making plans for you in this
75:10
little vapor of time that we're in right
75:12
now on this earth use it powerfully
75:17
to love to forgive and to be willing and
75:22
obedient understand John
75:26
his last message loved one another that
75:31
should be the thing we do the most amen
75:33
don't forget to love if you get a choice
75:36
forgive people who are bashing you when
75:39
you do that it really does wound the
75:41
demons and it is our time to torment the
75:44
Nieman's say it's our honor and
75:49
privilege to torment the demons those
75:57
demons ask Jesus have you come to
75:58
torment just before our time that meant
76:01
that was going to be a time when they
76:02
would be tormented is that right but he
76:07
didn't do that he gave us power right so
76:12
stand up for a minute I'm sure that Paul
76:20
is still enjoying his celebration party
76:23
it goes on for quite a while I know that
76:27
has something spent planned for him for
76:30
anyone who ever wanders he made it no
76:36
matter what you thought about his life
76:38
or consider for him he loved God he had
76:44
Christ in his heart he made mistakes he
76:47
repented for them amen and he's highly
76:52
honored and recognized in heaven for
76:54
what he did for God and they're happy to
76:58
have him home and so is his mom amen so
77:03
let's make a declaration I love to make
77:05
declarations say father thank you for
77:11
timing my birth on the earth for right
77:17
now I expect to receive the more to live
77:25
in the more to be
77:28
the more it is my commission I'm saying
77:34
yes right now I want to be chosen help
77:41
me to be willing and obedient and laugh
77:47
while I do it I asked for and receive
77:53
lots of fun
77:55
I need fun heaven has fun on earth as it
78:02
is in heaven I want to be dangerous
78:05
against hell the enemy is my doormat but
78:13
I am a ruler with Jesus Christ
78:17
I am royalty I am your son or daughter
78:23
this is the time I've been waiting for
78:29
amen amen sit down
78:55
do people have children here okay yeah I
79:04
don't want to run too late that I don't
79:06
get to lay hands on them if you have
79:11
children so maybe in a few minutes I
79:14
don't know what time do they pick them
79:15

79:19
okay wherever they are okay yeah I
79:31
really want you given I know I'm gonna
79:33
do an impartation tomorrow night I
79:35
really would like to do one tonight I
79:39
[Applause]
79:43
think instead of talking for another 45
79:46
minutes I'd rather do that amen so I'm
79:55
guest tonight because tomorrow night I'm
79:58
probably getting the lightning power God
80:00
last time I did it John G showed up
80:05
that's who I call John G Lake he did he
80:11
came and stood right next to me
80:12
other seers saw him it was really zap
80:16
BAM time but tonight I really want to
80:21
give out a measure of the fire amen I've
80:24
had a measure of baptism and fire and
80:26
let me tell you I've not ever been the
80:28
same so I want you to take it home with
80:31
you let it burn on the inside of you
80:34
don't let the fire go out what you're
80:38
really doing is preparing a place for
80:39
more to come say more say when I receive
80:44
some of something from God I can have
80:49
more
81:03
I know there's major things that are
81:05
about to happen in your lives shifts
81:08
because this is the time to shift
81:10
there's a lot of shifts the other thing
81:13
is suddenly those are two different
81:17
things a suddenly comes when you least
81:21
expect it but just one suddenly can
81:25
change your life it will fill you so
81:28
full of faith when God moves his hand
81:31
for you it's always a good thing
81:33
say suddenly are good things because God
81:39
is preparing you to receive more of him
81:42
amen suddenly just send you over the
81:46
edge probably about half the time
81:52
suddenly czar about finances or wealth
81:56
like a lot not like wow someone gave me
82:00
a hundred dollars like a lot we've had
82:04
quite a few sudden ease ourselves so I'm
82:06
asking God to give you some of those
82:08
also amen
82:10
so when I when I heart fire to you I'm
82:15
gonna add suddenly okay say I want the
82:20
Sun lease say I expect them I'm getting
82:25
ready for them I'm serious I really
82:29
wanted God I'm a suddenly son or
82:33
daughter so send it there you go now you
82:39
set yourself up so I just want to get
82:43
ready to lay hands on people it doesn't
82:48
matter how old you are you can have a
82:49
suddenly and you can also have the fiery
82:51
men I see some kids running around
82:56
they're gonna be fierce I'm talking
82:59
about children yeah I have several
83:05
grandchildren that already are fierce so
83:10
I expect them to be fierce amen say
83:13
fierce
83:15
is a good word in this more time of God
83:20
it's passionate remember the word says
83:25
we take it by force so don't do don't be
83:32
mediocre don't be lukewarm you have to
83:38
take it by force amen
83:41
in the time of John the Baptist until
83:43
now the Kingdom of Heaven stirs up and
83:47
encourages for us to be fierce amen and
83:54
dangerous and violent
83:58
say violence in the spirit realm is a
84:04
good thing when we have it that word
84:10
suffers does not mean that heavens being
84:12
beat up by somebody however back to the
84:15
translations God said go read some of
84:20
the translations and see how they have
84:21
translated or interpreted that verse
84:24
from the time of John the Baptist until
84:26
now the Kingdom of Heaven suffers
84:28
violence and the violent take up by
84:30
force and it literally said people are
84:32
running into heaven and stealing things
84:34
I don't know where they got that heaven
84:38
is under attack no I don't believe that
84:42
for a second it's us who are supposed to
84:47
be violently passionate against the
84:51
enemy and we had the right to take back
84:54
whatever he has taken from us because he
84:57
had no right to it Amen I love giving
85:02
revelation in the word - it actually
85:04
makes sense amen training up your child
85:09
and the gift God put in them whether
85:12
it's a drummer or a baker or an interior
85:14
designer in the never depart from that
85:19
gift because they'll be doing the thing
85:22
they love the most that word in there
85:26
says train up a child in the Ben
85:28
or the way he made them that means who
85:34
he sent you as what gift he made you and
85:36
sent you here every good and perfect
85:38
gift comes down from the Father of
85:40
lights and God said everybody sits on
85:42
the few of the chair every Sunday trying
85:45
to figure out what their spiritual gift
85:47
is but one of the most important gifts
85:52
he gave you is your natural gift your
85:54
passion what you love what he made you
85:57
to be or do in this earth that's not
86:00
your job it's the thing you're the most
86:03
passionate about you know your child is
86:05
a drummer if they beat everything
86:07
everything they have they beat on the
86:08
table with it you know straw spoons
86:11
forks whatever it is you buy them a farm
86:15
you know the farm is set for Christmas
86:17
and they pick them up and start beating
86:18
on something with them the cow and the
86:20
horse here they go take them in a
86:22
restaurant they use the straws take them
86:24
outside so they'll be quiet and then
86:26
they break branches off the bush and
86:27
start drumming with the bush say I think
86:31
they're a drummer so raise them up as a
86:35
drummer and they'll never run around the
86:38
world trying to figure out who they are
86:39
does that scripture make sense it's a
86:43
revelation that's how important your
86:46
natural gift is because when you go to
86:49
heaven he plans to use it it's
86:55
irrevocable you meant to be a baker make
86:58
the best brownies or whatever it is you
87:00
make everybody in the neighborhood loves
87:02
them that everybody tells you to sell
87:03
them when you go home to heaven you're
87:05
going to make that and everybody will
87:07
have it for free and everybody will love
87:10
you they have rodeos amusement parks
87:13
because people have gifts that do that
87:16
is that right that's why we have fun in
87:19
heaven and it's so natural they walk in
87:23
heaven and here's all the stuff they
87:25
need to design and to put together
87:26
something that won't take forever to
87:29
make it you're gonna be a baker as part
87:31
of your mansion you have a full out
87:33
kitchen with supernatural devices to use
87:36
and all the supplies you need and then
87:39
out in the front you have a bakery where
87:41
everybody comes body
87:42
your stuff Jesus will visit you
87:45
regularly he has a sweet tooth that's
87:51
why he liked honeycomb remember we
87:54
served on the beach to his disciples
87:56
remember he served him a meal he gave
87:58
them what fish and say honey when it is
88:05
cousin eat locusts and it ran in the
88:10
family say I'm in the family now I know
88:15
why I have a sweet tooth amen
88:20
okay we're going to we're going to do
88:22

88:25

88:28

88:30

88:32
