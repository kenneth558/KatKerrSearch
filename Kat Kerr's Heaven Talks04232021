02:31
well I don't know about you but I'm
02:33
really expecting it's been a great day
02:35
today so far and we haven't seen
02:37
anything yet and so again we want to
02:40
welcome you to the Healing Rooms
02:42
Apostolic Center and you know I I just I
02:47
always say this because it happens
02:48
almost every time we meet together you
02:50
just may be healed it happens in the
02:53
glory here all the time we have so many
02:55
angels here on assignment and I just I
02:58
just got a feeling some of New York and
03:00
just going to get healed you know a lot
03:02
of times it happens during worship
03:03
happens during the word and so we
03:07
definitely haven't opened heaven and
03:08
this is a place where miracles happen
03:10
so when you feel the presence of the
03:12
Lord we like to say it like this just
03:14
reach out reach out and touch him and
03:17
receive your miracle tonight all right
03:23
it's been excited we were living in
03:27
supernatural times and this has been a
03:29
supernatural week I'm sure every
03:31
here knows that Paul Kane went to be
03:34
with the Lord last Tuesday evening and
03:36
today was the afternoon when his body
03:39
was laid to rest in Santa Maria and just
03:43
different the signs and wonders
03:44
happening throughout the week and and so
03:47
I know that we're in the midst but we're
03:50
always in the midst of the supernatural
03:51
but it just seems like something special
03:53
and so we invited Kat a while ago and of
03:56
course nobody but God knew that Paul was
03:59
gonna go home and actually be buried on
04:01
the first day when she's speaking and I
04:03
know that it's not a coincidence I don't
04:05
know exactly what it means maybe she
04:07
does but I know stuff like that is not
04:10
just a coincidence so we're really
04:12
blessed and honored Kat to have you here
04:15
again and I'm sure how many of you have
04:17
never been in a live cat care meeting Oh
04:20
a lot of you good you're in for a treat
04:22
so why don't you can make your way up
04:25
Kat you need to come up around this way
04:26
and yeah you ready oh and while she's
04:32
coming up somebody dropped their glasses
04:34
so if that's you you probably can't see
04:36
but here they are when I put them up
04:42
here so Kat
04:43
um well brought those in you don't know
04:46
the Lord's been taking her to heaven for
04:48
several years and showing her things and
04:50
bringing her back and allowing her to
04:51
share with us so let's just welcome cat
04:54
Kirk
04:54
[Applause]
05:00
Wow
05:02
[Applause]
05:06
I know some people know why I'm saying
05:12
that some may not when the army of
05:16
heaven goes to battle against the
05:18
darkness that is their war cry why
05:25
because they're excited you're gonna
05:28
crush the enemy's plans over you right
05:30
they're gonna crush them they're gonna
05:33
pull down strongholds that have been
05:35
rising against you that's why they were
05:38
created news flash from heaven they
05:41
weren't created to protect heaven they
05:45
were made by the creator of heaven they
05:48
didn't get to kick Lucifer and one-third
05:51
of the angels out then you get to do
05:52
that
05:53
Michael hell them and the Father sent a
05:56
lightning bolt a million megawatts of
05:58
love from himself and took him out and
06:01
then one third of angels went out the
06:04
same way so they've been waiting a long
06:07
time to war on our behalf full time amen
06:13
I may or may not give you scripture for
06:16
that tonight go look it up I think most
06:20
of us know that Jesus was the lord of
06:24
state loud the host is the name of the
06:30
army of heaven yes they're still part of
06:32
the angel tribes but they're different
06:35
in many ways the ones under Gabriel have
06:40
many different positions and jobs in
06:43
heaven and on the earth and they look
06:46
more like us
06:47
they're the ones who look more like us
06:48
the army of heaven mostly does not look
06:51
anything like us they're creatures most
06:53
of them are creatures they're fierce
06:55
looking they're not gonna be pretty boys
06:57
with harps so what the Holy Spirit says
07:02
they're not gonna be pretty boys with
07:04
harps however there was one time when
07:08
they had to take the place of the
07:10
worship angels which were the one-third
07:12
that were kicked out the only ones
07:15
Lucifer got were the ones he was over he
07:17
was over one-third of the angels
07:18
was the worship angels obviously if he
07:22
was the one who led them in worship all
07:24
the time in heaven I'm just gonna give
07:27
you full out Revelation because I want
07:29
to take advantage of all the time I have
07:31
so if you didn't know this he used to
07:33
step inside God to lead worship he
07:36
covered over the very heart of God with
07:38
his wings which were embellished with
07:40
gems he had gems on his back on his
07:43
front people go well he had just a few
07:45
no he had really hundreds of them on him
07:48
and when God made him he made mountings
07:51
like in a ring and every gem was mounted
07:54
and amounting like a ring that you would
07:56
wear like this one here and he was
07:58
beautiful which is one of the reasons
08:00
why he ended up by falling from pride
08:02
from his beauty also he thought he was
08:05
smarter than God and that was a that was
08:08
busted mythbuster it's okay to laugh cuz
08:18
you're gonna laugh a lot tonight
08:19
alright heaven laughs every time the
08:23
devil loses down here all of heaven
08:25
roars yes they know what's going on and
08:29
today they were attendants for Paul Cain
08:33
with Paul Cain not talking about the
08:37
body talk about his spirit man everyone
08:42
gets to see their own homecoming isn't
08:44
that nice
08:45
so we're colors and play lots of music
08:48
and dance because that's what they'll be
08:51
doing in heaven news flash from heaven
08:54
number two they don't have a funeral in
08:56
heaven when you come home say Amen you
09:01
shouldn't expect one we should have a
09:04
party zone down here when we send people
09:07
off instead of a funeral home someone
09:09
opened a party zone I promise you'll
09:11
make more money than other people with
09:12
funeral homes cuz even the world will
09:14
want to send theirs off wherever they
09:15
think they're going they'll pick a party
09:19
anybody say Amen so that is a witty idea
09:24
I've been giving up for years I don't
09:25
think anybody's done it yet so there you
09:27
go the more real heaven becomes to the
09:32
body of
09:33
people will want to send them off with a
09:35
real celebration because of the reality
09:40
of what heaven is and what they're going
09:41
to be experiencing there it won't make
09:43
sense to have a sad funeral while
09:47
they're watching from the party I'm a
09:51
seer that means I see in the unseen
09:57
realm okay mister
10:01
I'm really happy Danny because I got to
10:04
experience all that heaven was doing and
10:06
what was going on with Paul Kane and his
10:09
mother and his sisters you know his
10:11
family that's up there and the others
10:14
who were attending up there watching his
10:16
service he enjoyed every funny thing
10:19
that was told he likes to be real so he
10:22
liked all the reality of who he was he
10:24
liked that personal side of him being
10:27
talked about so next time you plan a
10:30
family members homegoing service tell
10:33
some jokes because they will laugh I was
10:39
at a service one time and back home and
10:42
it was um trying to member the guys name
10:45
I remember told McClellan he was part of
10:47
story side B and he died suddenly and I
10:52
came into his service I didn't know
10:54
anyone but I was coming to bring some
10:56
books about heaven to his family the
10:57
Holy Spirit told me to and I saw him
11:00
watching from the portal that was really
11:03
difficult you know to try to pretend to
11:06
be sad and I never wear black it's okay
11:12
if you if you go to somewhere where
11:13
they're expecting you know to do what is
11:15
proper not to upset them but no one's
11:19
wearing black in heaven they're not and
11:22
they aren't having to partying there was
11:25
I saw Ron McClellan thank you my best
11:27
friend Holy Spirit he makes up for what
11:30
I don't know you know helps my human
11:34
head lots of times
11:35
because they kind of took that away from
11:37
me I used to be kind of brilliant
11:40
really then they made me like eight
11:42
years old
11:43
life is much easier being that way you
11:46
know what you don't worry about things
11:48
you don't think about what's gonna
11:49
happen five years down the road when you
11:51
don't even know or you already planned
11:54
you know prepare for disasters or
11:55
something I never got that really if
11:58
we're over the weather then we shouldn't
11:59
be concerned about the weather we rule
12:02
over it amen
12:03
okay she didn't know news bulletins
12:06
number three writes number three are you
12:07
keeping track you're gonna get a gift
12:11
number three
12:13
Jesus was over the weather we are joint
12:18
ears we get to be over the weather and
12:20
that great you're gonna see that more
12:23
and more I'm serious you're gonna see it
12:25
more and more things stop like stop
12:27
can't wait for that to happen
12:30
meteorologists might have to get another
12:32
job not making fake news by the way
12:37
they don't work now and it's not gonna
12:39
work when it's not actually happening
12:41
what was I talking about
12:46
number three boys over over the weather
12:52
Jesus was over the weather and he tried
12:54
so hard to teach his disciples he really
12:56
was in case you didn't know they were in
12:58
boot camp with him for three years it
13:01
wasn't just watch what I do
13:03
it's learn what I do and then do it
13:06
right he was gonna go he's gonna go back
13:09
for some R&R and he had to make sure
13:13
they understood how this whole thing
13:14
works being a joint heir with Christ
13:17
what do you have we have he said so
13:19
himself the things I did how point-blank
13:22
can you get the things and the works I
13:25
have done you will do well you forgot
13:30
the first part you will do also okay
13:34
these are just the works you got to do
13:36
the works say we got to do the works
13:40
then we get to do the greater say it
13:44
louder okay like you're excited well I
13:50
don't just try things I actually do them
13:54
there's a difference I'm just gonna try
13:57
that means you're not making much of a
13:59
plan about that right but doing it the
14:05
works I did you will do they do also and
14:11
greater works you will do I think that
14:18
means we're socially doing something
14:22
we're entering into a busy season a busy
14:26
season operating in the supernatural not
14:29
just talking about it a busy season
14:32
handling the wealth of the wicked not
14:34
just talking about it a busy season
14:38
living not just existing doing the more
14:43
say the more the more is amazing are you
14:49
getting better I am just as passionate
14:56
about living holy as I am about being
15:00
funny and I will tell you I I have to I
15:04
have to give you both sides of heaven
15:07
there's two sides in heaven there's holy
15:10
profound the other whole half of heaven
15:13
is funny say funny everybody have
15:19
they've thought for ever and for ages
15:22
that it would be boring in heaven maybe
15:24
because all they do is worship let me
15:27
tell you you stand in front of him it's
15:28
not boring
15:30
whether you're staring feeling like
15:33
you're going to faint melting to the
15:34
ground you know you feel like you don't
15:37
have breath in you because of just being
15:39
near him yeah it is an honor a privilege
15:42
and amazing when you worship and it's
15:44
not normal not even worship as normal in
15:48
heaven you ride on it you create things
15:53
as you're worshiping him you're creating
15:56
when you worship given the devil a big
16:00
black eye and a very bad day when you
16:04
worship Him you are shredding bashing
16:07
and crushing his fake little wannabe
16:09
Kingdom
16:10
in the second heaven when you worship
16:12
Him it's amazing from doing one thing
16:17
for him to honor him to bless him to
16:21
adore him
16:22
what destruction you do against the
16:24
kingdom of darkness that's my favorite
16:27
second thing I don't do demons I do do
16:34
Jesus though I love him I honor him I
16:38
can't do anything without him it's
16:40
because of him and with him and it is
16:43
his plan even the pink hair is his plan
16:47
because he's not boring there's nothing
16:51
boring about him there's absolutely
16:53
nothing boring about heaven there's
16:55
nothing boring about our future
16:58
that's like in the next few days the
17:03
more you believe things are real the
17:06
more real they will become and that is
17:10
actually a spiritual truth it's a spirit
17:13
realm truth the more you believe it is
17:15
real and talk about it being real and
17:18
write about it being real and actually
17:20
acting in it being real the more real
17:23
it's going to become to you it's the
17:26
original realm it's the eternal realm
17:29
it's not the temporary realm this is a
17:32
temporary life for you
17:33
it's a temporary place to live a
17:36
temporary to do things because this
17:38
earth is not eternal I know people have
17:41
worked it out in their own mind with
17:43
their head research and they're looking
17:45
up stuff and sometimes assuming because
17:49
I've read a lot of translations and
17:51
someone kind of miss it I know because
17:54
the Holy Spirit shows me those
17:55
scriptures then he'll show me 30
17:58
scriptures of it being translated I take
18:04
the word for the value it gives it's
18:07
real it is for us to repair us to
18:12
accelerate us to propel us into high
18:15
places you never dreamed of doing things
18:18
you never dreamed of we are living
18:21
examples of the
18:23
Father Son and Holy Spirit on this earth
18:26
that's why you're here you here to be
18:29
like them look like them and act like
18:32
them I don't see any failure in any of
18:36
that I don't see hopelessness
18:38
worthlessness I don't see fear at all
18:43
one of the first things the Holy Spirit
18:45
gives me these Kingdom quotes it's what
18:47
we decided to call him there's so many
18:49
we don't know what to call and we didn't
18:50
just say a quote the Holy Spirit is a
18:52
Kingdom quote was don't let fear
18:55
interfere that was a good one right
19:00
teach me never to fear never say never
19:03
at all in any way fear does not control
19:09
our life we do not partner with fear he
19:12
didn't put fear in us when he made us
19:16
we're supposed to be fearless and
19:21
timeless everybody should be yelling I
19:24
receive it say timeless we're supposed
19:31
to be timeless he said you had to die
19:38
I'm being serious not funny now serious
19:42
John didn't have to die did he say no
19:52
didn't Jesus say to the disciples what
19:55
is it so in other words he's saying it
19:56
doesn't matter what they think
19:58
you probably actually said that he's a
20:01
character he's the son of God but he is
20:04
a character the problem with the biggest
20:06
characters in heaven except for Holy
20:07
Spirit Holy Spirit has gotten beat by by
20:09
that much who they called the drama King
20:14
Jesus is the king of kings Holy Spirit
20:19
is a drama King you haven't only seen
20:22
just a little bit of his activity so far
20:24
waiting to the full fledge release on
20:27
this earth
20:30
he's excited he's excited about what's
20:34
about to happen in us they've been
20:37
waiting a long time say they've been
20:38
waiting a long time if I say the word
20:42
day I mean the Trinity they're not
20:46
boring
20:47
none of them they know how to step
20:50
inside of each other and be one one
20:52
thing that's how it happens I know I was
20:56
eight years old father caught me up
20:59
before the throne and said I'm going to
21:00
show you how the three can be one and a
21:03
five-year-old can understand that man's
21:05
head knowledge has expanded it and
21:08
expanded it and all kind of could use
21:10
every other kind of word explaining that
21:12
you know multiply it whatever you want
21:13
to call it made it look amazing powerful
21:15
and hard to understand it's simple they
21:21
can step inside of each other Jesus said
21:24
father I pray that one day that they be
21:27
one even as we are one because he steps
21:31
inside his father all the time when he
21:35
was the word he did the same thing I
21:37
didn't forget I was only on number three
21:40
bulletins by the way I've got some more
21:41
I was the least likely person to anyone
21:49
on this earth would have chosen to do
21:50
this okay I'm from a tribe like a real
21:54
one 15 people in an alligator and an
21:59
iguana innumerable amount of toad frogs
22:02
and lizards and spiders we grew up with
22:06
them in our home I had seven brothers
22:10
what did you think in Florida
22:12
you add that up that's what that comes
22:14
to sell your bike to some kid for a pig
22:17
bring him home wrap him up and close and
22:19
you have a new pet overnight we never
22:23
knew what was going to be in our home so
22:26
I didn't need anyone's opinions I was
22:29
never part of a group or a clique I had
22:30
a tribe God did that to kill me I'm a
22:35
dead person standing before you dead
22:39
people are wonderful for God to use
22:42
they're not full of self they don't have
22:46
their own opinion and the devil cannot
22:49
use a dead person the more dead you are
22:54
to yourself the more dangerous you are
22:57
against hell there are many ways to kill
23:02
me
23:03
before I even grew up and you know it
23:06
doesn't matter I mean I love everyone in
23:08
this room I loved all my siblings I
23:10
survived I conquered I was a leader
23:13
wasn't liked all the time but I was a
23:18
big help to my parents I honor my
23:20
parents greatly every day of my life I
23:22
loved them I didn't want to hurt them
23:26
they needed help say parents they need
23:31
help pastors they need more help
23:39
I'm grateful people can start a church
23:41
Oh No I've already died I don't need a
23:45
church I don't need a whole
23:47
congregations of people although I love
23:50
them I bless you all but I really bless
23:53
the pastor because they die every day to
23:58
be that amen
24:00
you'll notice that God didn't actually
24:04
send his son to be a pastor did you ever
24:07
notice that they actually sent him as a
24:10
businessman
24:11
God loves business people they're easy
24:14
they know how to listen they know how to
24:17
complete things that are given to them
24:19
they don't leave things out forget
24:20
things ignore things they do a job amen
24:24
so he sent his son as a businessman who
24:26
could easily connect with the sinners
24:30
and he did they ate with him all the
24:34
time they liked him he was exciting he
24:38
was interesting he was funny his
24:42
favorite job was to offend the hierarchy
24:47
he was good at it
24:50
and yet lived holy did miracles raise
24:54
the dead they took money from people for
24:57
spotted lambs they weren't high on God's
25:01
list and he had to train his disciples I
25:12
know he only had him for three years and
25:15
I think most of them finally got it
25:17
after he left but they did give him
25:21
credit they did but in the beginning I'm
25:25
sure Jesus would go to the Father when
25:27
he went to the mountain all the time and
25:28
say are you sure I have to that fight
25:33
all the time
25:34
they brawl over women I have one who
25:38
wants to be everything until everybody
25:40
that that would be Peter I have a
25:43
treasure you know that cheats all the
25:45
time right you know that you know he
25:48
takes money all the time I know you know
25:50
that too
25:51
and I have a tax collector and every
25:53
time you walk down the road to go
25:55
Minister we get stones thrown at us
25:56
because they don't like him I don't know
25:59
anybody who likes tax clusters they
26:01
didn't back then either so he did not
26:05
give him the best or the easiest to
26:08
Train and I know I was saying something
26:12
to God about my some of my staff and he
26:16
said I didn't make it easy for my son in
26:18
my conversation ended with that subject
26:22
especially when he caught me up me took
26:24
me back and I got to walk through a
26:26
whole day of their lives
26:28
like in their first year of being
26:30
together all right God I can make it God
26:38
has a plan for you every single person
26:41
is important to him and I do know this
26:44
your birth was timed on this earth God
26:50
created time he knew you before you were
26:53
born because you played inside of him he
26:56
saw you if there was time he saw you all
27:00
the time how great is
27:03
see that he was huge he could make
27:05
himself as big as he wanted to and he
27:07
walked on the mountains he was out where
27:10
there was nothing and he spoke and the
27:12
world would step out of him and make
27:13
space that God would make himself small
27:21
enough to step inside himself and play
27:23
with you he did say he's not a man he's
27:32
God and even being that great he knew
27:36
everything about you knew the mistakes
27:40
knew our faults knew everything that had
27:43
great hope and great plans for you to do
27:47
great things so it's no mistake you're
27:49
here now in this age instead of the ages
27:53
before this time you're here right on
27:55
time for the accelerator time for the
27:59
more of God for the kingdom age for the
28:05
time to command the hosts of heaven
28:07
handle the wealth by host cities for him
28:12
to use because he's not poor he knows
28:18
the names of your children that you'll
28:20
have even before you get married he
28:22
knows them and he put them in your
28:25
family line on purpose in this
28:29
generation that's here now this is a
28:31
special generation for God it's the
28:34
beginning of the group and type of
28:36
people that will remain until all things
28:39
be fulfilled some well the Bible says
28:47
there'll be a group of people like that
28:48
a group and type of people a generation
28:51
that we're generation means a group and
28:54
type of people it doesn't mean like 30
28:56
years or actually that word in the Bible
28:59
that says Jesus says that there'll be a
29:03
group and Type O people on earth that
29:04
will be here when all things be
29:05
fulfilled including the coming of him
29:08
that word means a group and type of
29:11
people that work generation means that
29:14
there will be a grouping type of people
29:16
on this earth that also says in the
29:18
Bible that would taste of the powers say
29:21
powers of the age to come that would be
29:29
the Millennial age of course there's
29:32
people now let's say they're not going
29:33
to be in millennium I go about what the
29:37
Bible says there will be a millennium
29:40
there will be a Tribulation God caused a
29:43
bump in the road it will happen that's
29:48
on his timeline in heaven so no matter
29:53
what other people have come come up with
29:55
or assume or have putting in
29:56
translations I promise you it's going to
29:59
happen and you can't make it happen or
30:01
not happen anyway so to me it's not
30:02
worth agreeing over God's gonna work out
30:06
his plan all the way to the end right
30:09
I'm excited to know that I'm part of
30:12
that generation that will tasted the
30:14
powers of the age to come
30:16
that's why you need revelation because
30:21
that that all that comes from the heart
30:24
of God he already knows what it's going
30:27
to look like she knows what's gonna
30:28
happen
30:29
so he chose you to be here to be a part
30:32
say Amen that word means so be yet might
30:39
as well say it gonna happen there's no
30:43
one on the earth in the earth around the
30:47
earth say it's round I gotta say that
30:50
the Holy Spirit won't let it go okay so
30:54
that's him say the earth is round not
30:59
flat they don't have edges you may say
31:03
that property does not have edges there
31:05
you go
31:06
Holy Spirit truck can we use proper
31:08
grammar Ben m8 that's how they say it
31:14
there is a whole group of people that
31:16
sincerely spend so much time and money
31:20
to try to prove the earth is flat I'd
31:23
rather use that money in that time and
31:24
energy ruling
31:26
right I've flown many times and I didn't
31:31
get halfway around the world then all of
31:32
a sudden here's the flat earth and I'm
31:35
flying it didn't all of a sudden go wait
31:36
shh now you're on the other side no I
31:40
went around besides I've already been up
31:44
over the earth it's round
31:48
God made it round he says he sits on the
31:52
circle of the earth not the square you'd
31:58
be surprised how serious they are they
32:02
think NASA has spent billions of dollars
32:04
faking it and none of that stuff is real
32:08
I don't know who got that thought but it
32:11
didn't come from heaven a man so just
32:17
rest assured that it's around okay been
32:21
there seen that it is round and when I
32:24
almost shown it God caught me up in
32:25
space up and do like like first space
32:28
not I've been way up there but the first
32:30
time he caught me up and showed me the
32:32
earth he put a grid you know like a grid
32:35
you know what that is yeah a grid was
32:38
round and he put it right on the earth
32:40
cheol-ho together and then they begin to
32:42
draw things on this grid that was his
32:45
plan that was called space planning that
32:47
was also the Holy Spirit's joke he's out
32:50
in space put the grid than planned right
32:53
uses every opportunity to be funny so he
32:58
did show me his space planning for like
33:01
the next hundred years that was probably
33:06
15 20 years ago when he showed me that
33:09
that doesn't mean the earth is going to
33:12
end in a hundred years
33:13
except been taken further than that and
33:16
no tribulation had happened I know some
33:20
people think it's supposed to be right
33:21
now well if it was it would be people
33:26
get to heaven they all find out man we
33:29
wasted so much time sitting on our
33:30
rapture rug
33:36
she to roll it up put it in the closet
33:43
well you've you've been around a long
33:45
time you realize I went to church
33:48
everyday it was open and every day
33:51
someone said Jesus could come tomorrow
33:54
and in my I'm like little this is like
33:57
little I had these thoughts why would he
34:00
have all these plans in the Bible and go
34:02
okay not forget that we're just all
34:03
going home I mean he gave my dad a long
34:08
plan I mean my dad knew him he gave him
34:11
a long plan I mean he's not going to
34:12
where we haven't done what God told us
34:14
to do yet
34:15
and God said well many people are in
34:18
fear and they know one day that will
34:21
happen so they want it to come so to
34:24
them that's logical they don't
34:25
understand a lot especially in the book
34:27
of Revelation say revelations means
34:31
revelations that means something you
34:35
don't know so God said I'm calling you a
34:39
Revelator me you know why he did that so
34:41
people couldn't call me a false prophet
34:43
they don't know what a Revelator is so
34:45
they didn't never say nothing against it
34:50
they couldn't say well she's not a
34:54
terrible pastor no he can't call an
34:57
evangelist she doesn't go out and win
34:58
lots of millions we can't call her that
34:59
huh can't call her prophet she's a
35:03
Revelator don't know what that is so
35:04
we'll ignore all of that a Revelator is
35:10
someone who reveals like John did caught
35:14
up showing the future the future no know
35:17
what that was that was a bling glitch
35:19
write that down and don't forget it I
35:21
know Jen is writing it down right now if
35:25
I say word she goes you did a bling
35:26
glitch that means you blended some words
35:28
together okay I won't explain it yes
35:35
you've been there I'm sure people been
35:37
there right you've been there well at
35:40
least I'm not talking about noses
35:42
putting the animals on the art tonight
35:44
that's Moses and Noah doing it together
35:50
when Donna even said Adam did it I did
35:55
hear from people I have a bloopers thing
36:00
one day and just put them all on there
36:01
go there and look at it but now I forget
36:07
we're talking about who is listening
36:12
Revelator you're right so see I hear
36:22
them all the time I have to fight when
36:25
you're eight you need help so he didn't
36:31
pick me to be a professor you know I was
36:34
graduated middle of my class like
36:37
literally middle we had six hundred
36:40
graduating students we have a lot of
36:43
people coming to Florida to go to school
36:45
I guess they like it we're pretty
36:47
laid-back there you know and so it's a
36:51
nice place to live if you want to come
36:52
live someplace different go good
36:55
vacation time try not to come in August
37:00
really hot so being a Revelator's a
37:07
little bit different that usually
37:09
doesn't mean profit just so you've
37:10
wondered you know John was a men and
37:16
it's okay I love doing that but I love
37:20
being with my father my heavenly father
37:24
him all the time I know why Jesus loved
37:29
him so much I know why he wanted to be
37:31
with him I know why he went away to the
37:33
mountain to spend time with him I know
37:36
how hard it was for him to leave home
37:37
and come here okay he was not poor he
37:42
didn't live poor say Jesus was not poor
37:48
he became poor when he left heaven
37:52
because heaven is certainly not poor
37:56
there's nothing poor up there nothing
38:00
splendor and wandering beauty you
38:03
couldn't afford to build the house that
38:05
you're mentioned that your mother lives
38:07
in you wouldn't even have the right
38:10
substances to make it the walls sing
38:15
literally they sing they leave you go on
38:18
tours come back they sing hello to them
38:21
the trees uproot their self and they
38:23
come and sit in your house and be your
38:27
friend for a while they'll go back to
38:29
the friendly forest is this ok it's not
38:36
gonna be normal no you can't be normal
38:41
you've been going to heaven for 20 years
38:43
you be normal to heaven they tell funny
38:48
stories a lot Bob Jones hasn't stopped
38:57
most people when they go there no matter
38:59
how they were here they're all happy
39:01
they love jokes they love to tell funny
39:03
stories hear funny stories they love it
39:06
they make plans for people before they
39:08
come they knew Paul was coming they all
39:15
knew Paul is coming there's a place you
39:19
go in heaven where you find that out and
39:24
you go in this beautiful amazing
39:26
building and these supernatural monitors
39:29
much better than ours but these are good
39:32
and you can see who's coming home who's
39:35
about to come home to heaven everybody
39:37
starts getting things ready they're so
39:38
excited they're there beside their self
39:40
they want to make sure they're all there
39:42
say all to meet you at the gate they
39:48
have a huge celebration they plan one
39:51
themselves heaven plans one the throne
39:53
room plans one people have celebrations
39:56
in the street over someone coming home
39:59
stay home it's because that's where you
40:03
came from we were alone to the earth for
40:07
a while when you go home
40:09
you are really home and you're not dead
40:13
they don't throw parties for people who
40:16
aren't alive they have huge celebrations
40:21
lots of music lots of food everyone
40:25
meeting one another
40:26
visiting Jesus welcomes you if he isn't
40:31
taking you himself sometimes he does
40:34
take people he comes into his own
40:35
chariot flaming horses picks you up and
40:38
takes you up to heaven then when you get
40:42
out you see the sea or the mass of
40:44
people waiting to greet you and then
40:49
Jesus walks you up the steps of the
40:51
throne to give you back to the Father
40:54
and then the father reaches out of that
40:58
glory that moves in and out of him the
41:01
Living colors of the bow coming in and
41:04
out his eyes flames of fire passion for
41:07
you just glowing and he reaches his arms
41:11
out and grabs you he says welcome home
41:14
my son welcome home my daughter you go
41:17
home as his children say we are his
41:20
offspring every morning gets their own
41:24
mansion you don't have to share it with
41:27
your brother or sister I'll have my own
41:31
one day it's made exactly the way you
41:37
would love it but it's made with his
41:40
presence in the walls and the floors and
41:42
it's not gonna be a normal shape trust
41:45
me it's not all your pets to be there
41:47
they'll be waiting to greet you eating
41:51
your food at your table your family
41:59
members will all have gifts for you for
42:01
every year you've been apart they will
42:03
get a gift that represents that year and
42:05
put it in your mansion after your
42:08
welcome home party in the throne room
42:10
which could last for quite a while
42:13
your family will come get you and take
42:16
you to your own mansion then they'll
42:17
have another celebration
42:22
everybody laughs and filled with joy to
42:27
see all the ones they loved before
42:29
little tiny babies they never got to
42:31
raise they get their children given to
42:33
them to raise the same one that you that
42:37
didn't make it all the way through amen
42:41
God keeps them they live with your
42:44
grandparents or whoever when they get
42:46
there they'll go get them and help raise
42:48
them for a while I love the story of a
42:51
mother they lost their son he was either
42:55
7 or 8 he was hit by a car and they of
42:59
course they they grieved over him but
43:01
knew he was in heaven and I think it was
43:03
like 20 years later or 30 years later
43:05
one of the other huh
43:06
she died on the operating table and was
43:10
caught up to heaven saw her
43:12
seven-year-old son playing in the
43:15
streets of gold he goes mom Wow mom
43:18
you're here this is so exciting
43:20
your mom I'm so glad you're here and you
43:22
cuz what have you been doing goes I've
43:24
been playing with my friends what you
43:25
think I've been doing he's been living
43:29
with his grandfather and playing with
43:31
all these friends and the streets to go
43:33
they were playing and he was laughing
43:35
and he said but you can't come yet
43:37
because it's not your time
43:38
and so she came back never forgot it and
43:43
her and her husband went around the
43:45
world talking about it you will be known
43:48
as you are known except you look better
43:53
like a whole lot better you'll have hair
44:01
most guys wear their hair about down to
44:04
their shoulders don't have you know
44:06
that's gonna change y'all I'm just
44:08
letting you know I can't change guys
44:10
unless you really want like a buzz cut
44:13
or something no Marine Corps or my
44:18
husband may still have one I would might
44:20
be surprised to see him alive yeah he's
44:25
still with me by the way another way to
44:26
kill me but that was okay
44:34
it's all worth everything it's worth it
44:40
all no matter what you surrender give up
44:44
miss doing it's worth it and you'll be
44:49
so happy when you stand before God and
44:52
you're welcomed home knowing that you
44:55
gave everything you could not saying you
44:58
have to walk around poor okay that was
45:00
the devil's plan not God's his plan is
45:04
to bless us say bless us and prosper us
45:10
it'll be worth it some people have
45:13
already seen Jesus here right how many
45:15
people have seen Jesus let me see either
45:18
in a vision or dream or in reality if
45:20
you've seen him how many people have
45:22
been encountered an angel there's
45:24
usually a lot there's a lot of people
45:26
here it's going to happen that's part of
45:28
the acceleration that's part of the more
45:31
it's a lot of them more actually that we
45:35
will see angels and they will probably
45:37
be talking to us they came from God
45:41
ignore what we've all been told our
45:42
whole lives don't talk to angels they
45:46
did in the Bible amen
45:49
there's gonna be a lot more of that
45:51
angelic not just visitation because what
45:55
we're going to experience is the
45:56
habitation heavens not coming for a
45:59
visit a heaven
46:01
is not coming for a visit they're coming
46:04
for a habitation you're part of the
46:09
habitation you are all of you sitting
46:11
here say I'm alive and breathing I'm
46:15
part of the habitation but God is about
46:22
to do on this earth does not just take a
46:25
territory here and there what the
46:28
habitation will be is in us say in us
46:34
that's the part of the habitation that's
46:36
why me and won't be able to control it
46:38
like they have in the past say God will
46:42
be in charge
46:45
it's a habitation and it will remain for
46:49
a long time he's gonna transform this
46:53
world right now he is shifting
46:55
government so he can shape Nations it's
47:04
part of the platform he's giving us in
47:06
the habitation
47:07
he's got platforms for us that's the
47:12
place that we will operate from and
47:14
speak from shake things cause things to
47:19
be released to change for him it's not a
47:26
lot of how it's always been in the past
47:28
that's why it's a new thing say a new
47:30
thing it's time for the new thing it's
47:37
where we will be ruling it's one of the
47:40
purposes that Christ died for us that's
47:43
why he went into hell and wasted it took
47:47
back the authority and Dominion the Adam
47:49
had given away he gave it to us he also
47:54
gave his power over all the power of the
47:57
enemy say we have power over all the
48:03
power of the enemy say he did not give
48:10
that to the Angels that's why we need to
48:16
command them they can't just go tear up
48:20
any demon they see they just can't do
48:23
that
48:23
they do it in in the past it was from
48:25
answers to prayer and prayers never
48:27
going to go away it's never gonna go
48:29
away
48:30
he loves prayer prayer is powerful it's
48:33
gonna get even more powerful especially
48:37
when you command part of an army of
48:38
heaven and they pull down strongholds
48:41
for you and crush the plains of darkness
48:46
we need this say we need it
48:49
to rule in this day say every King gets
48:55
the Kingdom and gets an army if we're
48:59
part of the kingdom we get part of the
49:03
army did you ever see a king a natural
49:08
King on this earth title rule with that
49:09
one they wouldn't go very far with a
49:13
they'd be overrun beaten up things
49:17
stolen things killed someone's like the
49:20
devil he comes to kill steal and destroy
49:30
that's what the army prevents heavens
49:35
army was designed created and made every
49:38
one of them unique and different but
49:42
they are fierce they have one job the
49:47
ones under Gabriel have many different
49:49
jobs many different positions to do many
49:52
different things but but Michael is over
49:56
one specific part and that is the army
50:00
they have a headquarters they have
50:02
barracks they have training fields
50:05
they're all in the sky of heaven Rand
50:08
maneuvers for ages in the past Jesus
50:12
would go send up Michael to gather the
50:15
army from the far ends of heaven to
50:18
fight on behalf of Israel people say
50:20
Amen
50:20
it's in the Bible go read it sometimes
50:25
they even fought the flesh did you know
50:27
that yeah some of them could fight the
50:30
flesh in this time on earth it's mostly
50:36
battles in the spirit battling the
50:39
demonic even those in the high places
50:42
the principalities and the powers the
50:46
things the beings in wickedness in high
50:48
places many of those high places will be
50:51
shredded and pulled down say our weapons
50:58
they are mighty to the pulling down of
51:03
strongholds that's one of the things the
51:07
army does I can only share what I have
51:13
been told and I can only tell you what I
51:16
have been shown shown and told that's
51:21
what I talk about but they didn't just
51:24
show me things and tell me things I had
51:26
to live it every way something mom is
51:29
trained in it was for the body of Christ
51:32
so I had to live it to let you know it's
51:36
real and it really does work she follow
51:39
heavens protocol see on earth as it is
51:44
in heaven
51:45
that's what we've been asking for for
51:49
generations we should have expected it
51:56
jesus bushwhacked us all he did he told
52:01
me is it I knew if I taught them that
52:03
and said you say that eventually it
52:06
would come you mean one thing I could
52:10
get them to agree on no matter what
52:14
denomination they rod to clear that
52:17
prayer because they need us to call
52:21
things in is that right you have not
52:27
because you ask not
52:31
if you've ever said to Jesus I'll give
52:34
you anything you want no matter what it
52:36
is where it is what time it is I give
52:39
you permission to use me as anyone ever
52:41
says something like that let me see your
52:44
hands
52:45
well I'll get ready because he's calling
52:51
in those words yes it's gonna be amazing
52:56
say amazing heaven is amazing it's gonna
53:01
be amazing here we can live on earth
53:04
like they live in heaven which is mainly
53:08
his will being done
53:11
his way say his way not our way that's
53:18
part of the more she's gonna do new
53:21
thing he goes revelation and then ways
53:25
for you to use that revelation it means
53:28
a lot of things are gonna change so if
53:31
you're stuck in your own mind or your
53:33
own mindset of what you think is gonna
53:35
happen and because it didn't it's not
53:37
going to you need to just so that away
53:40
because he does have a timeline in his
53:44
own throne room and those dots on that
53:47
timeline is when his things are going to
53:50
happen regardless of what anybody on the
53:54
earth is doing it's his sovereign will
53:57
and what right now this time we're in
54:00
it's on his timeline it is many of the
54:04
generals are going home doesn't mean
54:07
they'll be oblivious to what we're doing
54:10
that means they'll know all about it
54:12
after they get there and the thing
54:13
they'll be celebrating is us who are
54:15
still down here being a part of it so
54:21
God really needs us right now he's
54:34
intimidating me although I probably
54:36
would have never chosen except when he
54:40
asked me I said yes say it's important
54:44
to say yes to being chosen many are
54:50
called but few are chosen because they
54:55
don't choose that's why many aren't
54:59
chosen he can't make you do it right
55:04
you're called you're being called but he
55:07
can't make you do that you have to
55:09
choose yes and when you do that you're
55:11
saying yes I want to be chosen and then
55:14
you're chosen what does it take to be
55:15
chosen say choose yes
55:21
then you got to be willing he makes it a
55:23
little bit you know gotta be willing and
55:25
obedient say willing obedience next say
55:35
surrender is not control a lot of people
55:42
think it is because you know God does
55:45
have he does have I'm trying to think of
55:52
the natural earthward it's like not
55:54
there he does have guidelines is that
56:00
right even Jesus had them that he
56:03
operated by Jesus didn't just pick
56:06
things on his own all the time where did
56:10
he say I do yeah what his father said
56:17
right but he showed him and what he told
56:20
him that's what he did that's why we
56:24
need revelation otherwise we're gonna
56:27
get man's mind set on everything and
56:30
that hasn't worked well has it he's not
56:36
going to abandon the church I've heard
56:39
all kinds of things when people's gonna
56:40
abandon the church it's just gonna go
56:42
away burn down we don't need it anymore
56:45
let's get rid of it when he's not saying
56:47
that to me he's going to set it on fire
56:52
amen this is a time to be willing and
56:56
obedient if you want to eat the fat of
56:59
the land and Jesus did ask us to pray
57:03
about one other thing pray that my
57:05
people say we are his people be willing
57:11
and the day of his power well obviously
57:16
if he's going to give us revelation to
57:18
operate like he does and part of that is
57:22
power
57:22
he says he'll give you power over all
57:25
the part of the enemy there's one right
57:26
there
57:26
he's given us power and he does have
57:31
power
57:33
so if this is the day of his power the
57:36
biggest thing the most important thing
57:37
is remember the willing and obedient
57:38
thing what he asked probably won't seem
57:42
natural or normal to you wasn't natural
57:46
normal to ask me to have pink hair I
57:49
wasn't a pink haired person I liked it
57:53
he wouldn't have asked me it's better
57:57
than camel hair I like pink here any day
58:02
over camel hair it smells it's stiff not
58:09
comfortable and he had to wrap himself
58:11
in it okay my pink hair is a test it
58:18
divides asunder the Spirit from the
58:21
flesh so those who trash or bash it or
58:26
in the flash are we still so walking the
58:30
flash say no we're supposed to walk in
58:35
the so people don't have to tell me if
58:40
they're hearing their flesh or hearing
58:42
their spirit it's the way they react to
58:45
the pink care now people who like pink
58:48
hair they think is amazing so the world
58:49
must be passing their tests because they
58:53
all love it that's amazing you look
58:56
amazing what do you do I'm a
58:59
spokesperson for haven't I've been there
59:02
and then they all say the same thing
59:05
they don't say you're liar your father's
59:07
property was that they go what was it
59:09
like what was it like is it beautiful is
59:14
it amazing is it real is is God real is
59:16
there a god and go oh yes there is a God
59:20
and you lived inside of him before you
59:22
came here okay that makes him interested
59:26
not bashing amen
59:30
try that next time you did live in him
59:36
you moved in and out of him he was your
59:39
very existence you had your very
59:40
existence in him that's why he knew you
59:43
that's why he saw you before he sent you
59:46
here you're wonderfully and perfectly
59:51
made your souls were the most amazing
59:54
parts of you of all you change your very
59:57
life by what you feed it you change how
60:01
you feel about things by what you say
60:04
yourself if you don't like you then
60:08
change change what you're saying change
60:12
what you're watching change what you let
60:14
other people say around you because you
60:16
need to guard your heart what goes in
60:20
there is what you will become
60:22
amen if you've never heard that before
60:26
it's Revelation on your soul your soul
60:28
is what you are people say well I'm
60:32
missing that no Adam became a living
60:36
Saint loud he became a living soul
60:43
that's how important it is to God that's
60:45
why he gave you a soul you could choose
60:47
yourself you could choose with your will
60:50
you can think about things choose it and
60:52
then you do it and then your emotions
60:56
display who and what you believe with
61:00
your life it's probably one of the least
61:03
talked about things in the church it's a
61:06
soul growing up I always heard that it
61:09
was bad and went but God made it right
61:13
he it's one third of us is that right
61:16
we'll always have our soul
61:18
why would he make it bad it's a powerful
61:22
thing and it's a good thing because you
61:25
can feel yourself with God and then
61:26
you'll be like him you can talk about
61:29
him then you really believe he is real
61:32
you can feed your soul 24 hours a day
61:36
your body gets fed a few times a day
61:39
your spirit man gets fed once a week
61:43
most people go to church once a week but
61:48
your souls fed all the time by what you
61:52
watch what you say what people say to
61:54
you you can be crushed by tragedies and
61:57
you can't you can't forget it you hang
61:59
on to it somebody
62:00
you wound and hurt eunuch stays there
62:02
forever your soul has layers and it
62:06
collects things in those layers that's
62:09
why you have a memory but your layers
62:12
are supposed to be used for different
62:13
something different than that every
62:16
layer of you looks like you who wants
62:19
revelation on the soul let me see your
62:20
hand I was shown one and the father
62:26
spent four hours with me earth time I
62:28
never usually know but I looked at my
62:30
clock and I was talking to him then he
62:32
just catches me up and begins to show me
62:35
a human soul what it look like how he
62:37
made it why did he make it that way how
62:39
people can cause her soul to prosper all
62:41
the time and then they live in divine
62:43
health there was a requirement about
62:47
that prospering it says even as your
62:51
soul prospers you will prosper and you
62:55
will be in health that where B means lib
62:59
it's called divine health so I since I
63:05
learned about the father taught me about
63:07
that he said people can loose with the
63:09
keys of the kingdom you can loose things
63:10
out of your soul when you loose it it's
63:13
gone
63:14
and that doesn't matter what it is he
63:17
started giving me this very long list of
63:19
things that you can loose from your soul
63:21
and he said I know most people buying
63:24
the devil but the keys to the kingdom
63:26
but they mostly never talked about the
63:29
loosing thing what are gonna do with the
63:30
loosing key and yet the binding key is
63:34
more important to bind the things of God
63:37
to your soul because then they can't be
63:38
taken away what you choose to bind to
63:43
your soul about God will never be taken
63:46
from you and so people I know you know
63:51
if you still want to bind the devil go
63:52
ahead and do it I'd rather loose the
63:56
stuff out of my soul that he tried
63:57
putting there you know if you have an
64:00
anger issue in your anger anger angry
64:02
all the time you don't even know you're
64:03
just angry it's all it comes out of you
64:05
it's in your soul you choose with your
64:08
will to loose that's that anger then
64:12
heaven comes down and they pull it out
64:14
saywhat sluiced on earth is loosed in
64:18
heaven you know how amazing you would be
64:22
if you didn't have all that junk in
64:23
there especially wounds and wounds can
64:28
keep you from the things of God as much
64:31
as sin can don't leave a wound in you
64:35
because then the enemy will come and try
64:37
to use it amen
64:40
so tomorrow night not tonight we're
64:43
gonna do a soul checkup I hope you're
64:47
coming who's coming tomorrow night hope
64:48
everybody's coming home you don't want
64:52
to miss tomorrow night this is just the
64:53
introduction we're gonna do some
64:57
spiritual warfare with the hosts they'll
65:01
be excited you mean leaving an army if
65:04
you don't have one they were made for us
65:08
amen they won't let you worship them
65:11
they don't have time for that and
65:14
neither do you
65:15
amen tomorrow night we're gonna have
65:19
some fire sent the Angels already
65:22
outside waiting but they're gonna do
65:24
that tomorrow night I did this recently
65:27
where I mean people were literally
65:28
flaming like they were flaming because
65:34
this is time just darkening I want to
65:37
say drops of it the fire of God is
65:41
amazing it comes from himself inside him
65:45
say our God is a consuming fire I'm
65:49
about to get consumed it's one of the
65:54
most asked asked things by the body of
65:56
Christ send the fire I want the fire
66:01
give me the fire let me be consumed let
66:03
me burn for you it burns everything off
66:07
the walls of your heart I mean literally
66:09
make sure your heart white you are
66:15
filled with boldness like you've never
66:16
had before in your life you're fearless
66:20
you're bold you you got filled with God
66:23
the fire it burns it out then he puts
66:28
him in
66:28
selves in there he heaps more stones of
66:31
fire inside of you those came from God
66:35
two stones a fire I find a one
66:39
translation said that they were they
66:41
were flaming stones that Satan left on
66:43
some other planet that was in a Bible
66:48
and I already knew what they were so God
66:51
made me look up like 29 different
66:53
translations to go see what they say it
66:54
is like they missed that one no they
66:59
didn't ever belong to Lucifer okay they
67:03
were inside God or he burns with this
67:07
fire for you under the water they burn
67:11
in the River of Life that's in him the
67:14
river flows out of him the gemstones
67:17
flow out of him even the steps of the
67:19
throne room have gemstones they flow out
67:22
of heaven and become the crystal see is
67:24
called the crystal see because there's
67:26
gemstones in it not sand
67:30
that's why it's cut crystal faceted
67:33
gemstones they're all over heaven they
67:36
all come from one place when the father
67:38
and the firewood burn inside of him and
67:41
Lucifer would step in and there's his
67:43
holy mountain inside God say God is not
67:47
a man he doesn't look the same inside
67:52
that we do but we lived there that's why
67:57
we like sparkly things way back in our
68:01
way back in our spirit man we remember
68:06
that we met we remember that there's
68:09
something that connects when we look at
68:11
something that's brilliant and beautiful
68:13
gemstones represent the love of God his
68:17
love his revelation upon this rock I
68:21
know he said Peter was a rock when God
68:24
says rock in the Bible he's talking
68:25
about a gemstone you know that white
68:29
rock that white rock rock or stone
68:31
you're gonna get when you go home to
68:32
heaven and there's a name under the only
68:34
he and you know it's a white diamond
68:37
it's not a River Rock
68:40
every syllabus I ever saw showed a river
68:43
rock when it talked about that that
68:46
stone so inside his eternity you never
68:52
see at the end there's no end inside of
68:56
him no end and we ran up and down this
69:00
mountain and we slid down the river of
69:02
life and would jump on the stones of
69:04
fire through the flames we lived in
69:07
those flames you're about to get
69:10
baptized with him it's amazing I don't
69:16
even know what time it is I better check
69:17
what time is it oh my my see gem she's
69:31
at it you didn't finish talking about
69:35
Ron McClellan remember I was at his
69:41
service right and I can I come in with
69:44
these books in his parents and
69:46
grandparents are sitting on the front
69:47
row I didn't know him so but I knew a
69:49
couple people there at celebration
69:51
Church they let me come in and I just
69:53
was going to wait till everything was
69:55
over and they were everybody with their
69:57
line going by the casket and he had this
70:01
bright yellow suit on I mean bright with
70:05
his big white tie and and he had the
70:07
biggest fro I've ever seen on a human
70:09
they had to stick it down in the casket
70:12
and as I was walking I was walking up I
70:17
looked up I was trying not to laugh out
70:21
loud because it was an open portal and
70:24
he was watching his service and now this
70:27
is a band right band in a van travelling
70:32
telling jokes non-stop doing sock
70:35
puppets you know crazy stuff he did
70:37
crazy things in the van with the guys
70:39
and his band was there and they were
70:42
telling the funniest stories and every
70:44
time they say something funny he would
70:45
go like this is here we go
70:53
so here I'm looking at the casket and
70:56
then I look up there
71:00
he was alive for now and there was a lot
71:02
of funny stories right so I'm like this
71:04
is just this crazy it was so much fun
71:06
and so I went back sat down and then it
71:10
came up when I gave out the books and I
71:13
didn't know who his parents were I knew
71:15
who his wife was and her mom dad were
71:17
there and I gave them one and I didn't
71:21
know that was his father sitting there
71:22
so I was telling you know his wife this
71:24
is a book about heaven I really think it
71:26
a bless you and I started to turn away
71:28
and and the Holy Spirit to tell me take
71:30
an extra one so of course willing and
71:32
obedient I had an extra one in a little
71:35
bag wondering who was gonna give it to
71:36
and he grabbed my arm II said did you
71:38
say that book was about heaven
71:40
I said yes I I've been there he says can
71:42
I have that book and I said yes yes you
71:45
can have and he goes well I'm Randstad
71:48
well was then this was for you because I
71:51
didn't know you were gonna be here but
71:53
he told me to bring it so this is your
71:55
book and a few months later I get a
71:57
phone call it's always in the middle of
71:59
night and it's his parents and they're
72:02
undone they were so full of joy in
72:04
celebration after reading about what
72:07
heaven was like they already knew what
72:09
their son would be doing having a band
72:10
and he does have a man and it's called
72:12
the other side of the story his heaven
72:17
he went from story side be to the other
72:20
side of the story that was his bayum but
72:23
in the band
72:24
angels were playing and singing with him
72:27
because he said he wouldn't let anyone
72:29
take the place of his band when they
72:31
came to heaven which I told their band
72:34
and so his parents called they were
72:37
really excited about everything and and
72:39
then I they gave me their daughter's
72:42
phone number he and his sister were
72:43
really close together and so I called
72:46
and just spoke to her for a few minutes
72:48
and and then about I don't know it was
72:50
probably a year later she called me she
72:51
goes today is my birthday my 30th
72:55
birthday and I just wanted to know does
72:57
my brother even remember me does he
73:00
still think about me because we had
73:02
planned a big celebration on this day
73:04
we didn't know he'd go home so I while
73:08
she's on the phone to me God caught me
73:09
up to heaven and I saw her brother
73:13
standing at a portal
73:15
this goes sound wild but it didn't
73:17
matter he was throwing Cheetos at her
73:19
from the portal and he was singing the
73:24
worst rendition of happy birthday I've
73:27
ever heard and this is a guy who sings
73:28
sent was singing for a living right
73:30
like me and this that's awful that's
73:33
awful
73:33
and then God sends me back and I'm she's
73:38
still going on the phone I said wait a
73:39
minute wait wait wait wait wait I got to
73:40
you hey I don't know what you can think
73:42
about this but I got to tell you what
73:43
what I just saw in heaven I saw your
73:46
brother and he was throwing Cheetos over
73:49
the portal at you and she starts to yell
73:52
and scream she goes that that's she said
73:57
he even had a throw by he run by what do
74:02
you want a Cheeto throwing whatever he
74:04
had her fro to so he said his greatest
74:07
thing to do was run through the room and
74:10
throw as many Cheetos in her fro that
74:12
would stick there and she said he did it
74:16
all the time and I was so irritated but
74:17
now it's the most precious thing in the
74:19
world that you told me that because I
74:21
know he didn't forget me this is on her
74:23
birthday remember and I said oh I don't
74:25
know how to tell you this but he he
74:26
sounded the worst I have ever heard
74:29
for someone who's anointed to sing she
74:31
said was it the worst happy birthday you
74:33
ever heard in your life I want ya she
74:35
said he did that every year too so she
74:39
was so blessed to find out she that he
74:43
had not changed he still remembered her
74:46
he was still himself and she was so
74:50
blessed by that so now if Jen there Jen
74:53
I finished the story I'm done with okay
74:56
so I want to encourage you to understand
75:00
that your family still loves you no one
75:04
has forgotten you
75:06
they're making plans for you in this
75:10
little vapor of time that we're in right
75:12
now on this earth use it powerfully
75:17
to love to forgive and to be willing and
75:22
obedient understand John
75:26
his last message loved one another that
75:31
should be the thing we do the most amen
75:33
don't forget to love if you get a choice
75:36
forgive people who are bashing you when
75:39
you do that it really does wound the
75:41
demons and it is our time to torment the
75:44
Nieman's say it's our honor and
75:49
privilege to torment the demons those
75:57
demons ask Jesus have you come to
75:58
torment just before our time that meant
76:01
that was going to be a time when they
76:02
would be tormented is that right but he
76:07
didn't do that he gave us power right so
76:12
stand up for a minute I'm sure that Paul
76:20
is still enjoying his celebration party
76:23
it goes on for quite a while I know that
76:27
has something spent planned for him for
76:30
anyone who ever wanders he made it no
76:36
matter what you thought about his life
76:38
or consider for him he loved God he had
76:44
Christ in his heart he made mistakes he
76:47
repented for them amen and he's highly
76:52
honored and recognized in heaven for
76:54
what he did for God and they're happy to
76:58
have him home and so is his mom amen so
77:03
let's make a declaration I love to make
77:05
declarations say father thank you for
77:11
timing my birth on the earth for right
77:17
now I expect to receive the more to live

77:34

77:41

78:13
I am a ruler with Jesus Christ

78:29
amen amen sit down

[Applause]
79:43
think instead of talking for another 45
79:46
minutes I'd rather do that amen so I'm
79:55
guest tonight because tomorrow night I'm
79:58
probably getting the lightning power God
80:00
last time I did it John G showed up
80:05
that's who I call John G Lake he did he
80:11
came and stood right next to me
80:12
other seers saw him it was really zap
80:16
BAM time but tonight I really want to
80:21
give out a measure of the fire amen I've
80:24
had a measure of baptism and fire and
80:26
let me tell you I've not ever been the
80:28
same so I want you to take it home with
80:31
you let it burn on the inside of you
80:34
don't let the fire go out what you're
80:38
really doing is preparing a place for
80:39
more to come say more say when I receive
80:44
some of something from God I can have
80:49
more
81:03
I know there's major things that are
81:05
about to happen in your lives shifts
81:08
because this is the time to shift
81:10
there's a lot of shifts the other thing
81:13
is suddenly those are two different
81:17
things a suddenly comes when you least
81:21
expect it but just one suddenly can
81:25
change your life it will fill you so
81:28
full of faith when God moves his hand
81:31
for you it's always a good thing
81:33
say suddenly are good things because God
81:39
is preparing you to receive more of him
81:42
amen suddenly just send you over the
81:46
edge probably about half the time
81:52
suddenly czar about finances or wealth
81:56
like a lot not like wow someone gave me
82:00
a hundred dollars like a lot we've had
82:04
quite a few sudden ease ourselves so I'm
82:06
asking God to give you some of those
82:08
also amen
82:10
so when I when I heart fire to you I'm
82:15
gonna add suddenly okay say I want the
82:20
Sun lease say I expect them I'm getting
82:25
ready for them I'm serious I really
82:29
wanted God I'm a suddenly son or
82:33
daughter so send it there you go now you
82:39
set yourself up so I just want to get
82:43
ready to lay hands on people it doesn't
82:48
matter how old you are you can have a
82:49
suddenly and you can also have the fiery
82:51
men I see some kids running around
82:56
they're gonna be fierce I'm talking
82:59
about children yeah I have several
83:05
grandchildren that already are fierce so
83:10
I expect them to be fierce amen say
83:13
fierce
83:15
is a good word in this more time of God
83:20
it's passionate remember the word says
83:25
we take it by force so don't do don't be
83:32
mediocre don't be lukewarm you have to
83:38
take it by force amen
83:41
in the time of John the Baptist until
83:43
now the Kingdom of Heaven stirs up and
83:47
encourages for us to be fierce amen and
83:54
dangerous and violent
83:58
say violence in the spirit realm is a
84:04
good thing when we have it that word
84:10
suffers does not mean that heavens being
84:12
beat up by somebody however back to the
84:15
translations God said go read some of
84:20
the translations and see how they have
84:21
translated or interpreted that verse
84:24
from the time of John the Baptist until
84:26
now the Kingdom of Heaven suffers
84:28
violence and the violent take up by
84:30
force and it literally said people are
84:32
running into heaven and stealing things
84:34
I don't know where they got that heaven
84:38
is under attack no I don't believe that
84:42
for a second it's us who are supposed to
84:47
be violently passionate against the
84:51
enemy and we had the right to take back
84:54
whatever he has taken from us because he
84:57
had no right to it Amen I love giving
85:02
revelation in the word - it actually
85:04
makes sense amen training up your child
85:09
and the gift God put in them whether
85:12
it's a drummer or a baker or an interior
85:14
designer in the never depart from that
85:19
gift because they'll be doing the thing
85:22
they love the most that word in there
85:26
says train up a child in the Ben
85:28
or the way he made them that means who
85:34
he sent you as what gift he made you and
85:36
sent you here every good and perfect
85:38
gift comes down from the Father of
85:40
lights and God said everybody sits on
85:42
the few of the chair every Sunday trying
85:45
to figure out what their spiritual gift
85:47
is but one of the most important gifts
85:52
he gave you is your natural gift your
85:54
passion what you love what he made you
85:57
to be or do in this earth that's not
86:00
your job it's the thing you're the most
86:03
passionate about you know your child is
86:05
a drummer if they beat everything
86:07
everything they have they beat on the
86:08
table with it you know straw spoons
86:11
forks whatever it is you buy them a farm
86:15
you know the farm is set for Christmas
86:17
and they pick them up and start beating
86:18
on something with them the cow and the
86:20
horse here they go take them in a
86:22
restaurant they use the straws take them
86:24
outside so they'll be quiet and then
86:26
they break branches off the bush and
86:27
start drumming with the bush say I think
86:31
they're a drummer so raise them up as a
86:35
drummer and they'll never run around the
86:38
world trying to figure out who they are
86:39
does that scripture make sense it's a
86:43
revelation that's how important your
86:46
natural gift is because when you go to
86:49
heaven he plans to use it it's
86:55
irrevocable you meant to be a baker make
86:58
the best brownies or whatever it is you
87:00
make everybody in the neighborhood loves
87:02
them that everybody tells you to sell
87:03
them when you go home to heaven you're
87:05
going to make that and everybody will
87:07
have it for free and everybody will love
87:10
you they have rodeos amusement parks
87:13
because people have gifts that do that
87:16
is that right that's why we have fun in
87:19
heaven and it's so natural they walk in
87:23
heaven and here's all the stuff they
87:25
need to design and to put together
87:26
something that won't take forever to
87:29
make it you're gonna be a baker as part
87:31
of your mansion you have a full out
87:33
kitchen with supernatural devices to use
87:36
and all the supplies you need and then
87:39
out in the front you have a bakery where
87:41
everybody comes body
87:42
your stuff Jesus will visit you
87:45
regularly he has a sweet tooth that's
87:51
why he liked honeycomb remember we
87:54
served on the beach to his disciples
87:56
remember he served him a meal he gave
87:58
them what fish and say honey when it is
88:05
cousin eat locusts and it ran in the
88:10
family say I'm in the family now I know
88:15
why I have a sweet tooth amen
88:20
okay we're going to we're going to do
88:22
