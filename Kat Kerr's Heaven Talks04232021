[Applause]
00:07
if you see me making hand motions i'm
00:09
copying the angels in the room
00:13
they never are stagnant
00:17
they're always moving they're always
00:19
moving and so they really loved
00:22
anything that worships the lord
00:26
every time they go wild leaving in the
00:29
throne room when
00:29
when you're worshiping or adoring jesus
00:32
christ
00:33
just for a while but a lot of them they
00:35
were going like this well most of them
00:36
were going like this
00:40
except the ones behind her one behind
00:43
her was going
00:47
so i have to call you when i'm watching
00:49
it's hard not to do it
00:51
the throne room is a powerful powerful
00:54
place
00:55
it is so amazing to have been there and
00:58
the seraphim when the seraphim starts
01:00
singing
01:00
they come out of the glory cloud over
01:02
the throne and their hair is on fire
01:04
it's like blue fire
01:05
and they sing and they sing and they
01:07
sing and they sing
01:09
i keep inviting them to come so if they
01:11
ever showed them though your hair
01:12
probably turned blue and catch on fire
01:17
there's some of the fire carriers in the
01:19
throne room but to be there on purpose
01:21
there's nothing like
01:23
no one is up there crying that they
01:27
died as hard as that might seem to you
01:31
to imagine
01:32
they're not no one's crying no one is
01:36
sad
01:37
no one is grieving no one remembers
01:40
anything
01:41
bad that rhyme that wasn't me his holy
01:43
spirit
01:45
they they don't they're so in the glory
01:48
really and that thing about for all of
01:52
sin that comes short of the glory of god
01:54
it's not about you committing sins
01:56
i hear that you know if they don't have
01:57
revelation they don't understand what
01:59
that means
02:00
that means you you should be carrying
02:03
the glory
02:04
you should be carrying the glory you
02:05
should be carrying it for him releasing
02:07
it for him
02:08
it comes out of you like shockwaves
02:09
begin to permeate
02:11
everything it touches every person every
02:13
place
02:14
we we we don't do that we don't know how
02:16
to do that
02:17
it's something we'll do now in this time
02:21
you are in one of the most important
02:24
times on the face of the earth one of
02:26
the most blessed times regardless of
02:28
what your i see your ears here no
02:31
you were chosen from the beginning of
02:33
time to be here you were meant to be
02:35

02:38
all of your family members are so
02:40
excited you're here
02:41
amen you're not looking at the mass
02:44
you're not looking at the virus which is
02:46
you know
02:46
pretty much gonna be taken off the face
02:48
of the earth by god
02:51
it's being used against everybody it
02:53
really is
02:54
i'm not saying it's not there i'm not
02:56
saying it hasn't touched some people
02:58
but it's nothing like what they're
03:00
saying it is
03:01
you need to know the truth i bring the
03:05
truth i have to speak the truth okay
03:08
all of this that you're living in now
03:10
will be like
03:11
dust in a very short time
03:22
acceleration in this world
03:26
and not just america this whole thing is
03:28
yes
03:29
it's here we know it's here uh we we
03:31
talk about it we share what do we do
03:33
but let me tell you it's worldwide what
03:35
god is going to do
03:38
he he is planning and his plan will take
03:42
place
03:43
it will say it will say god's will
03:47
god's way not man's way
03:51
not the enemy's way it will be god's way
04:00
this country will be known by the glory
04:03
of god
04:04
the presence of god
04:10
and he's setting it up
04:13
you yes to understand there's covert
04:15
operations in heaven
04:16
and there's covert operations on earth
04:20
and maybe you don't know all that but
04:21
yes things are happening you cannot see
04:24
but you will see them suddenly say
04:26
suddenly
04:28
it will all be known say everything will
04:31
be known
04:34
all the stuff about the elections will
04:36
be known
04:43
[Applause]
04:53
and we will celebrate
04:56
[Applause]
05:04
and i know wonderful people talk about
05:06
revivals
05:08
a lot of people talk about moves of god
05:11
a revival is kind of i don't want to say
05:13
stagnant
05:14
but it's kind of centralized in certain
05:16
places what's coming isn't going to be
05:18
centralized
05:21
moves of god will come together to
05:23
create one
05:25
thing and that is called a habitation
05:29
say habitation is what is coming
05:34
it can't be controlled it can't be
05:37
stopped
05:39
and it can't be changed it's coming from
05:43
heaven
05:45
and we will be the habitation
05:50
no one can move us or take
05:53
us from the place god puts us
05:59
so no matter how people are putting it
06:01
what really is coming is a habitation of
06:03
god
06:04
yes that has never happened before on
06:08
the face of the earth
06:09
and you will not just get delivered
06:12
you'll get to share it you get to
06:13
experience it you get to carry it say
06:15
carry it
06:17
say the knowledge of the glory
06:20
will happen because we
06:24
will carry that glory all over this
06:27
world
06:30
so don't think of yourself of being left
06:32
out okay
06:33
that's not possible say if i'm alive
06:37
and breathing i'm part of it
06:44
that's how it's gonna be this time amen
06:46
amen say for
06:48
generations step out of your box and
06:52
just say it for generations
06:55
until god is done the boy will grow and
06:59
build
07:00
and cover the whole earth like the
07:03
waters cover the sea
07:06
the world will know there is a god
07:11
and they better decide amen
07:18
the other thing that i know is truth we
07:20
can all say this together
07:23
nothing that was done
07:26
through cheating stealing
07:30
lying unjust
07:34
accusations will not escape
07:38
being brought to justice
07:44
[Applause]
07:51
and let me tell you the god side knows a
07:54
whole lot that's been going on that
07:55
maybe you don't know
07:57
and i am talking about trump
08:01
that's okay if you're not okay come
08:03
outside we'll get you saved
08:09
and you know the person who likes him
08:12
the least is the devil
08:15
truly the one who's most terrified of
08:18
him of trump
08:19
is the devil say the devil doesn't like
08:22
him
08:23
maybe i should
08:28
one of the few presidents who has said
08:30
to the people i'm here to give your
08:31
country back to you
08:33
and i'm here to welcome jesus back into
08:35
the white house
08:41
he wasn't always perfect everyone knows
08:43
that especially the fake news but
08:45
they're stuck
08:46
on it they all they do is hit replay
08:51
and i've traveled all over the world
08:53
when all that stuff started people were
08:54
what's wrong with your news i want
08:56
nothing not my news
08:59
and not my news by the way you'd be
09:01
better off not listening
09:03
to anybody okay they know that they can
09:06
brainwash you they know that they can
09:08
compromise your soul to believe
09:10
exactly what they're saying and that's
09:12
why they keep
09:14
saying it if you've never heard things
09:16
about people that have gotten
09:18
brainwashed
09:18
that's how they do it they get you in a
09:22
place
09:23
so you will believe what they're saying
09:24
then they'll say it over and over and
09:27
over and guess what's going to come out
09:28
of your soul
09:29
say as a man thinketh in his heart
09:32
that's his soul so is he
09:36
that's what's happened to all of them
09:39
their souls have been compromised
09:41
they know it okay the darkness knows it
09:44
all the others who are part of all that
09:46
mess they all know that
09:48
and that's why they keep it going that's
09:50
why they don't want the truth to be
09:52
known
09:54
that's why they don't want us saying
09:55
anything that's why they block you or be
09:58
in you whatever they're doing
09:59
they're so terrified that people will
10:03
hear the truth and begin to believe it
10:06
they don't want them i know i know i
10:08
have i have really close friends
10:10
who just did that they fed on it they're
10:12
not the same people
10:14
they're not the same people that's why
10:15
every now and then anyway free soul
10:17
checkup
10:18
and i offer help to all those out there
10:20
who have been compromised
10:23
lose it from your soul
10:26
and i'm really serious about that he
10:28
made us that we can
10:29
loose things remember the keys of the
10:32
kingdom what you loose on earth
10:34
will be loose from heaven what you bind
10:36
on earth
10:37
can be bound on him loose all the bad
10:40
all the negative
10:41
all the hurt trauma tragedies
10:44
all of the fear all the fake news every
10:47
word you've ever heard lose it all from
10:48
your soul
10:49
heaven will come down and pull it out
10:52
and they really do that they will do
10:54
that i've seen people change in three
10:56
minutes from doing that
10:58
then then you bind the things of god i
11:00
choose my will to find the life of god
11:03
the love of god the presence of god his
11:05
will
11:06
his way his word i find the truth to my
11:09
soul
11:10
and there is no one on the earth that
11:12
can take it out of you
11:14
that's what they need to heal the world
11:17
actually needs a soul checkup right
11:20
so it's not that hard to be free
11:24
it's not number one you have to know
11:26
that you're not
11:28
you need to know when you've been
11:29
deceived because the devil for eons and
11:32
ages always use fear as his number one
11:34
weapon
11:34
now it's deception
11:38
it really is because when you say yes to
11:40
deception you're deceived
11:42
and when you're deceived you can't see
11:43
the truth understand the truth
11:45
or even want to know the truth so
11:49
this whole country and other people all
11:51
over the world
11:52
i always do those soul checkups if you
11:54
hear me doing it that's why i'm doing it
11:55
i want them to be free
11:56
right that's right and after the first
11:58
election i offered it free to all the
12:00
democrats
12:03
a post-election therapy i called it
12:08
to have your soul set free
12:11
and a lot of people did it and i have
12:13
that a lot of people call me contact let
12:14
me
12:15
play says hey i did that i'm free
12:19
we will get some new networks i promise
12:21
you the truth is
12:23
some of them will close and be shut down
12:25
we'll keep on with the truth okay
12:27
from the justice that's coming some of
12:30
them will lose their network
12:33
and you don't even know this but some
12:34
ceos have already started stepping down
12:38
the thing about deception is when you
12:40
aren't deceived and you willingly
12:42
knowingly
12:43
do what's wrong and you know commit
12:45
crime you're
12:46
quite aware that it just might not work
12:49
yeah
12:50
so this whole thing that they're doing
12:52
when they see isn't working
12:54
they just put more barbed wire around
12:56
them
12:59
he's not god they can't stop god
13:02
i'm not going to stop god
13:06
so i also knew this that when these
13:08
things the landslide
13:10
starts can't stop it that's called
13:12
justice amen
13:14
a lot of them will try to run some may
13:16
end their life
13:17
we need to pray for those people because
13:19
they don't want
13:20
they don't want what that word was
13:21
saying up there about the shame they
13:23
didn't want
13:23
people to know what they were doing but
13:25
everyone's going to know what everybody
13:27
was doing because it's already been
13:28
collected
13:29
amen and so they they have proof all the
13:33
proof they need
13:34
and i will just mention this for those
13:36
who don't know this is a truth
13:38
meeting how about that this is the truth
13:41
the truth is that they've already been
13:43
uh tried
13:45
in a different kind of a court and been
13:47
found um guilty
13:50
and uh in case you didn't know uh trump
13:52
is actually a president i just say that
13:58
he did win he wants anyone
14:02
they tried to steal it it's not going to
14:06
work
14:07
[Music]
14:08
and the crazy thing in all this is
14:10
they're trying they
14:11
when i say they i mean the left delivers
14:13
whatever you want to call them they
14:15
god calls me villains i'll just say what
14:16
he does the villains
14:18
we're hoping we would just give up and
14:20
do what they wanted
14:22
they forgot one thing we
14:25
we the people do not
14:29
a third world country where we are in
14:32
control
14:34
say we are free and we're staying free
14:37
man that made a big mistake and one
14:42
thing he didn't consider
14:44
that we wouldn't don't all dumb goblin
14:46
has happened
14:47
no they're not smart because we run
14:49
closer to him
14:52
we get closer to him we hear him clear
14:54
we become more dangerous against hell
14:57
that's what happens when you press on
15:00
god's people that's exactly what
15:01
happened so
15:02
mistake number one was that you thought
15:04
everybody would just dump god and give
15:06
him up
15:08
they don't know us say they don't know
15:09
us
15:11
they're about to find out amen
15:13
[Music]
15:14
so that was their first mistake the
15:15
second mistake is we're already free
15:18
we live free say we're free right now
15:22
we aren't bound get anything to villains
15:26
has written down his new laws
15:30
and i have to say this to you because
15:32
the father said this to him he said tell
15:33
them this please
15:34
it says when the righteous are in power
15:36
the people rejoice so why don't you
15:38
rejoice
15:41
because the truth is the humans
15:44
have no power they are not in power say
15:47
the villains
15:49
are not in power the righteous are in
15:52
power
15:53
so we're going to keep rejoicing while
15:56
they remove the others
16:01
the best show on earth jesus christ
16:03
wiping out hell
16:09
these are going to be glorious days and
16:11
i am so excited to be here
16:13
okay i got born again i i came out born
16:16
again i think
16:17
i do remember at age four receiving
16:19
christ and because i'm a senior i saw
16:20
him step inside of me
16:23
you can't tell a child is four years old
16:25
that he's not real and that doesn't
16:26
really happen
16:28
you're really more open to it than most
16:29
people when they get older it's a little
16:31
bit harder because your mind gets in the
16:32
way
16:35
i saw him step inside of me i liked it
16:37
so much when i turned five for my
16:38
birthday i did it all over again
16:41
this is how precious jesus he stepped
16:43
out to step back in
16:45
[Music]
16:47
for a birthday present
16:51
so living life with heaven all the time
16:53
is definitely different
16:54
i tell people all the time i'm i'm like
16:56
an eight-year-old if you pick on me
16:58
you're picking on nate road they forget
17:00
it really soon right
17:02
they see a pretty flower a crawling bug
17:04
or a piece of cake and they forget it
17:08
so he really did i i worked with ceos
17:11
most of the time i was
17:12
i love business i'm a business person
17:14
actually i'm a ceo hey
17:16
this is how we dress when you get in
17:18
here and having your ceo right
17:20
they're the best apparel ever you don't
17:23
get a nightgown in the bathrobe and
17:25
having people i hope you didn't
17:31
not for the one who owns everything
17:35
he's not going to give you that that's
17:37
not what people wear up there
17:38
you have an apparel wardrobe room it's
17:41
like a thousand square feet maybe more
17:43
than that
17:44
and every kind of beautiful amazing
17:46
thing because there's so many things to
17:48
do in heaven you can't ride a roller
17:50
coaster in a gown
17:53
in case you wonder i wouldn't try it
17:58
for so long i grew up in the church
18:01
trust me from the day i was born i was
18:03
in church
18:04
and i was there for every revival every
18:07
special visitor it didn't matter if it
18:08
lasted six weeks i was there every night
18:10
for six weeks along with all my siblings
18:13
and my parents would space the older
18:15
ones in between the younger ones you
18:16
know when you got 15
18:18
i mean several people i was i was an
18:20
adult at age eight
18:21
that's why he kept me video see i earned
18:23
it
18:24
because from that age i had to help take
18:26
care of my 12 of my siblings
18:29
everyone was a chief okay they were all
18:32
in charge
18:33
all highly anointed uh you know they
18:36
they needed to be tempered a whole lot
18:40
they practiced on me
18:45
and from a very young age i could see in
18:47
the spirit room i understood it
18:49
being the father son holy spirit i
18:51
remember when i invited the holy spirit
18:53
he came
18:53
inside me like a whirlwind and he's been
18:56
there ever since and i can tell you how
18:57
that happens
18:58
who wants to know how he can be
19:00
everywhere at the same time anybody want
19:01
to know
19:03
he has unlimited layers of himself
19:07
one of the key words in heaven is layers
19:10
there's layers of everything layers of
19:13
space
19:14
you can have like 10 places on your
19:16
space your one mansion's on
19:19
and it's hard to explain except when
19:20
they teach me how to say it
19:22
you can see it and so on your mansion
19:25
let's say you have a city
19:26
i've seen some people's mansions the
19:28
size of new york city so maybe you
19:30
better expand
19:31
your thinking say expand that
19:38
and on your management property there
19:39
are these doors suspended just above the
19:41
ground
19:42
a beautiful door different colors
19:44
different doors
19:45
like around your or your whole property
19:47
where your actual mansion is sitting on
19:49
whether it's in the middle of the
19:51
crystal sea under the crystal sea on top
19:53
of the mountain spices in the valley of
19:54
the falls
19:55
uh wherever it is that he puts it uh
19:58
on that property will be doors and if if
20:01
you
20:02
open the door you can see the other
20:04
space that yours
20:06
with places in there that are yours
20:09
you can walk around the door like i
20:11
could walk around this this is how
20:12
there's no limit to space in heaven
20:15
here's the door let's pretend this is
20:17
the door
20:18
you can walk around the door you see the
20:20
door right you see it
20:21
you can walk around it's just this but
20:24
if you open
20:25
the door you step into another whole
20:28
area that belongs to you
20:30
that could be in the valley of the falls
20:32
the mansion out here is maybe on the
20:34
beach of the crystal sea
20:35
or the mountain spices so you get many
20:38
he said
20:39
what do you say i go to repair a place
20:42
for you
20:44
in my father's house
20:48
a world not a flat place in the sky
20:54
are many mansions
20:57
i go there to prepare a place for you
21:02
so he's not going to tell you any more
21:03
than that
21:05
oh until you get there and then you find
21:09
out
21:10
really how magnificent and amazing he is
21:17
there's so many things adventure
21:19
excitement intensity
21:21
a joy humor all of that is in heaven
21:24
that's why we have it here say it was
21:28
there first
21:30
it trickled down to here
21:34
they have mountains they have valleys
21:36
they have oceans you can ride a 200 foot
21:38
wave and
21:38
not die when you crash off of your board
21:40
because you haven't done enough times up
21:42
there
21:44
the waves can change direction while
21:46
you're on them okay they can open
21:47
up they can swing you back and forth
21:52
is heaven
21:55
it says eyes have not seen your ear
21:57
heard or entered in the heart or mind of
21:58
man
21:59
but he has prepared for you except
22:02
and unless is revealed by the spirit of
22:05
god i stand
22:06
on that scripture for every time they've
22:08
taken me every time they've shown me i
22:10
can stand on
22:11
that because of that i can see
22:15
i can know and i can't understand
22:18
and that's my commission my commission
22:21
is to reveal heaven to this earth
22:23
that's why i go all the time non-stop
22:25
they have not stopped since
22:27
1996 taking me
22:30
i used to try to count gave that up
22:33
pretty soon
22:35
and guess what when does he do it
22:37
whenever he wants to
22:39
why i gave him permission you have my
22:42
permission to do with me whatever you
22:43
want if you ever said that you better
22:44
watch out
22:45
because these are the days of the
22:47
glorious signs and wonders that
22:49
manifested signs
22:51
with through the daughters and sons of
22:52
god on the earth
22:54
those aren't other beings who are going
22:56
to come here and have it
22:58
yes you say it's us
23:02
we're your sons and daughters
23:05
we'll manifest and demonstrate
23:12
[Applause]
23:18
hearing things and uh seeing things you
23:20
never saw before
23:22
and don't worry when he tells you you're
23:25
going to hear him
23:26
how does he do that uh step up and do
23:29
that
23:30
step out go up to the front of the
23:32
funeral and raise the dead that was
23:34
cremated
23:37
[Music]
23:38
[Applause]
23:48
that happened a few times maybe facebook
23:51
won't block it
23:55
that's probably going to be replaced
23:56
also by the way
23:59
yeah they'll just be replaced
24:03
and you know they didn't really do all
24:04
that until guess who started running for
24:06
office
24:08
because he's a threat
24:11
he said you can't be bought talk about
24:12
trump again i don't mind insane
24:14
it can't be bought can't be controlled
24:17
they can't make him afraid
24:18
and he already knows the truth
24:21
so they can't convince him to lie they
24:24
can't even deceive him
24:25
he knew all of them before this started
24:27
happening
24:29
because the wealthy and the rich are
24:30
invited to everybody's inner circle
24:32
whether the good or not they know
24:34
he knew the corruption that's why he was
24:36
willing to do it
24:38
we don't know what they're lying out of
24:40
their teeth i know what they're doing i
24:41
know all the stuff they're involved in
24:42
no hey
24:43
yes i will run
24:46
and they were afraid from the day he
24:48
said that they tried everything we could
24:50
of 17 people trying to get that spot on
24:52
the republican ticket
24:54
and god told me i will eliminate them
24:56
one by one
24:58
by one and they will be forced to put
25:00
him there
25:01
guess what happened they were forced to
25:03
put him there
25:06
amen
25:09
i know even even through history there's
25:11
always been people that nobody else
25:12
would have picked but god
25:16
and some of them were very colorful
25:20
yeah but if anybody ever heard all the
25:23
stuff that was said against him
25:24
they would think he wasn't worth
25:26
anything and yet right now he's very
25:27
valuable to god
25:29
if anybody likes it or not he will be
25:31
leading all this stuff that's going to
25:33
be happening
25:35
and while we've been out here some
25:36
people not maybe y'all
25:38
people are afraid not knowing what their
25:39
life is going to be like how's
25:41
everything what about all these horrible
25:42
things being made from the
25:44
villains laugh
25:49
that's what heaven is doing about it
25:55
there probably was never anything on the
25:56
papers just so you know that
25:59
they didn't waste the time to do it they
26:01
whatever they can get away with the food
26:03
people they're doing this is to say this
26:04
is truth
26:08
we just can't be deceived amen
26:11
and most of people i've talked to i
26:12
start to start a conversation
26:14
anywhere in the airport the grocery
26:16
store i don't care where it is so what
26:18
did you think about the elections
26:21
see i used to say
26:24
hey i voted for trump
26:30
90 of everyone i talked to by the way
26:32
you voted for trump yeah
26:34
they did and the ones that didn't don't
26:37
even know what the other ones are doing
26:38
up there right now i confronted one of
26:40
those the other day in my own yard
26:44
yeah my husband hired him to mow front
26:46
yard and came to the back he should have
26:47
never done that
26:49
i was about there i was back there
26:53
because
26:53
we released a home from friends of ours
26:55
who were pastors in new york so
26:57
uh the guy was replacing the little
26:59
fertilizer fertilizer see i can't even
27:01
think that what are they called where's
27:03
my husband
27:05
where are they putting the ground those
27:06
tubes to kill the bugs that come in to
27:08
eat your house up
27:09
terminator
27:12
see my natural brain don't ask me a
27:15
question
27:17
heaven spirit round future past you know
27:20
anything about
27:21
god father son holy spirit the 12
27:24
you know what are they the 12
27:28
the 24 elders know i know all of them
27:32
already
27:35
oh the seven spirits of god aren't just
27:37
his attributes
27:38
those are seven spiritual beings in case
27:40
you wonder
27:41
oh yeah they are actually seven smooth
27:44
the wednesdays so they're seven
27:46
spiritual beings
27:48
it's one of the images they use god
27:50
sends them on special assignments
27:54
i laugh when you hear cloak and dagger
27:55
that's usually about you know murder
27:57
mysteries but
27:58
actually holy spirit wears a club all
27:59
the time he loves to
28:01
he wears one the seven spirits of god
28:03
wear them that came from heaven that's
28:05
not a hell thing
28:07
hell stole too many things okay
28:10
say house deals because they can't
28:13
create something new
28:18
and so anyway so i was back there with a
28:20
guy replacing those termite tubes
28:22
and i said the same thing hey so uh he's
28:24
up say he's a millennial too
28:26
i said so what did you think about the
28:28
elections i think they were stolen
28:30
yes they were still on the
28:33
lousy themselves
28:36
they're all villains i want you to say
28:38
what god calls them
28:40
and then comes around the corner the
28:42
other guy
28:45
so what do you think about the elections
28:47
oh i think i am so glad they got someone
28:49
in there the other one was such a rotten
28:50
lousy guy
28:51
oh you're talking about fighting right
28:54
might as well say his name
28:55
yeah now i'm talking about something so
28:57
oh no no no no he is the good
28:59
guy do you know what the other ones are
29:02
doing
29:02
do you even know what they're doing well
29:04
i know they're doing good things for
29:05
this country but
29:07
you cannot watch one single thing that
29:09
they said they're doing
29:12
and you don't know that they want to let
29:15
all the terrorists in the world
29:16
here with no pulse bar
29:19
did you know they want to break down the
29:20
law so all those human trafficking
29:22
people can come through and just gather
29:23
more
29:24
to take out and and you obviously don't
29:27
know that they're going to wipe out
29:28
church completely because they don't
29:29
want god here
29:31
and this guy guy had already said to me
29:33
god bless you well
29:34
that's who you believe then you don't
29:36
need to know those people up there
29:39
because god's not blessing now he's
29:42
going to remove them
29:43
oh i don't think that let's just end
29:45
this really quick conversation
29:47
i would tell you they have all the
29:49
evidence if they had no no i'm not
29:50
talking about
29:51
civil civil evidence i'm talking about
29:53
military tribunal
29:55
evidence i'm talking videos i'm talking
29:58
testimonies i'm talking things that have
29:59
been taped that you would be so
30:00
horrified to find out what they actually
30:02
have been doing
30:03
even before they started their what they
30:05
knew who they connected to what they've
30:07
been doing all around this world
30:08
it's already there it's there and they
30:11
have it
30:12
these guys who are in there now faking
30:16
who they think they are they will be
30:17
wiped out and god will say exactly who
30:19
our president
30:20
is back there maybe not in that spot but
30:23
he's going to play back he will still
30:25
run this country he is president he
30:27
doesn't have to be proven to be
30:28
president he already has won
30:30
he won the other guy over here going yes
30:34
yay the termite guy
30:38
and this guy was probably in his late
30:40
40s and this young guy knew more than he
30:42
did
30:43
he was he was very aware of what was
30:45
going on you'd be surprised
30:47
if you talked to how many people voted
30:49
for the other guy
30:50
don't know anything that they're doing
30:53
because all they know
30:54
is they hate the other one
30:58
and that was their plan we will bring
31:00
this i'm serious
31:01
it's what they do in other countries
31:04
they brainwash people to believe what
31:05
they want to
31:06
then they go do whatever they feel like
31:09
that's how those people live that's how
31:11
people live in venezuela
31:12
and other countries they know what
31:15
socialism and communism is and they
31:17
don't want it this way they try to
31:18
escape
31:21
so they made a few announcements and the
31:23
whole rest of their campaign on the left
31:25
was
31:25
how horrible he is and if you ask him
31:29
why is he horrible well i don't know but
31:30
he's just
31:33
i can free you from that right now in
31:34
your soul do you wanna then they run
31:36
come over here i'll get rid of that of
31:38
your soul you need to get that out of
31:39
your shoulder you can live a normal life
31:41
again
31:44
and actually tomorrow's when i talk
31:45
about america
31:48
this is this commercial for tomorrow
31:52
amen because heaven
31:55
is celebrating everywhere right now
31:58
they're celebrating because they do know
32:00
what time it is on god's timeline
32:03
and if people don't know this is i'm
32:05
talking about pastors and i won't talk
32:06
about pastors revenge as well okay
32:08
evangelists kind of got it made because
32:10
they're still going for the big harvest
32:12
right now we're going to talk about the
32:14
naked harvest we're going on with the
32:16
big harvest that's what we're here for
32:17
what
32:17
no you should be a voice for truth no
32:19
matter what else you do you should say
32:21
the truth
32:22
let people know where you stand with
32:24
what god
32:25
wants what god asks of us let
32:28
life live let life live and don't take
32:32
it amen
32:34
and anyone who wants to take life you're
32:36
already in a really hard spot
32:38
but god if you voted for life to be
32:41
taken from babies
32:42
you are in trouble and i can honestly
32:45
say that according to the word of god
32:46
you're in trouble
32:48
you are and one day you'll be falling on
32:50
your face repenting when you find out
32:51
the truth of what the other ones were
32:53
doing continually amen
32:55
so i gotta let go let's let go and set
32:58
it back here
32:59
somewhere up here
33:03
because god is right now beginning to
33:05
create that habitation
33:06
and people need to know number one the
33:08
world's not ending
33:10
now i'm talking about heaven it's not
33:11
over say it's not over
33:14
i just the father says it's over
33:18
not even jesus knows when it's over
33:24
and i have new spheres not coming for a
33:26
church that is fighting each other angry
33:28
at each other
33:29
despising each other spitting on each
33:31
other shall i continue
33:34
coming for a church and a bride who has
33:38
no sin and no
33:41
flesh showing up in flesh and
33:44
fleshy fighting it is what the spiritual
33:48
mind is
33:49
life refreshing mind it is
33:54
he said i offer you life and death what
33:55
do you say to choose my life
33:57
a lot of people miss that this time
33:59
around
34:01
because life is what you're going to get
34:02
everybody's going to get life even the
34:04
ones who didn't want it it's going to
34:05
come it's not going to stop from coming
34:07
and he knows his timing he has a
34:09
timeline around his
34:11
behind his own throne his throne is in
34:13
the middle of the throne room
34:16
it's not on the back wall and you'd
34:18
always seen these paintings
34:20
there's god on his throne and there's
34:23
millions of people all over here who
34:25
can't get to him he didn't ever do that
34:28
it's in the middle when four sets of
34:30
steps
34:31
and people run up there all the time all
34:34
the time
34:35
if you make it to heaven you're going to
34:37
get to see god okay you get to see
34:39
father you get to see jesus
34:41
i never understood these people that
34:42
said there's levels you have to get you
34:43
after you get up there
34:44
no the bible doesn't say does that
34:47
no no it says the pure in
34:50
heart shall see god
34:54
amen and that means it can be now once
34:57
you get born again
34:58
or when you go to heaven people need to
35:01
get over that
35:02
no one can see the face of god and live
35:04
oh trust me
35:05
everything within you that was wrong
35:07
would die instantly if you saw him
35:10
but the bible clearly says the pure
35:12
heart shall see
35:14
god right so guess what i see him
35:20
i see him i see jesus christ i didn't
35:22
see the invisible spirit of god
35:24
i see the outline of his person usually
35:27
fires going around him
35:28
or whirlwinds of the rainbow or going
35:31
around him
35:32
but i see him he's big
35:37
and he is called the drama king in
35:38
heaven
35:42
well he sure creates drama every time he
35:45
touches the earth doesn't he
35:48
they were not suspecting him back in the
35:51
day when he fell
35:54
and began to do things that people were
35:56
spinning and jumping
35:58
over furniture and they really were
36:00
doing crazy wild things way back they
36:02
didn't even know what they didn't
36:03
really know what they had they just knew
36:05
it felt good
36:07
we should be well acquainted with it he
36:09
is my best friend and he speaks to me
36:12
all the time
36:13
guess what he's always speaking
36:17
always say always are you hearing him
36:22
you're hearing but maybe we need to
36:25
unclutter our soul
36:27
the more stuff you get in the layers you
36:29
are a later being holy spirit as
36:30
unlimited layers thank you holy spirit
36:32
for reminding me i was supposed to talk
36:33
about that
36:34
see i told you you don't smell the time
36:36
holy spirit is
36:38
very powerful being he's still with
36:40
celebration and joy
36:42
drama excitement that's him if there's
36:45
enough roar in heaven
36:46
holy spirit there then i get corrected
36:50
doctrinally i thought he moved to the
36:52
earth
36:54
why don't you have a conversation with
36:55
him i'll let you talk to him about that
36:57
and see what he says to you
36:58
okay he has unlimited layers of himself
37:01
so when he involves you you don't get a
37:03
little piece you get a hold of him
37:08
he takes a layer of himself and throws
37:11
it in you
37:13
that's how that happens unlimited
37:16
layers that's how he can be everywhere
37:19
all the same time
37:20
all over the world know everything see
37:23
everything
37:23
hear everything
37:27
you can invade any places he's invited
37:29
to somebody's not invited to
37:32
he's the most exciting single beings the
37:35
most excited
37:37
being in existence
37:40
right now right now i see jesus can't
37:43
come back right now
37:45
the father's up there delegating through
37:47
governmental stuff all the
37:49
stuff that's going on right now on earth
37:50
but the holy spirit
37:52
well he didn't move his operations here
37:55
that doctrinal person was right
37:57
he did jesus said when i leave i will
37:59
send who
38:00
the holy spirit the comforter the one
38:02
who will walk alongside hey walk
38:03
alongside
38:06
yeah unless you invite him in
38:09
if you ever wonder what spiritual
38:10
protocol is
38:13
even in heaven you must invite
38:16
okay you must invite i'll prove it you
38:19
invited jesus christ
38:20
right yes say yes he did we can take
38:23
care of that right now
38:24
[Music]
38:26
you must invite jesus christ
38:29
to be your savior repent of your sins
38:32
invite him to come in this is all
38:34
scriptural
38:36
john 3 16 he will come into you
38:39
he also has unlimited layers
38:42
and he made you with unlimited layers of
38:45
you
38:46
everyone in here has layers that look
38:49
just like you
38:51
is this exciting yeah it should be it's
38:54
the way you meet your soul
38:55
your soul your emotions are all your
38:57
layers the more emotional we are the
38:59
more
39:00
layers of you you have in you what does
39:01
it do with those layers well
39:03
when you get born again because you
39:05
invited him
39:07
right he takes one and he seats it in
39:10
heavenly places
39:12
and it's you it literally is it
39:14
literally really
39:15
truthfully is you it's a part of you it
39:18
looks just like you
39:21
still connected to your soul
39:24
so all around your will let's say this
39:26
is your will
39:28
it's a strong column off of that from
39:30
all these layers that look just like you
39:32
but they move like they're living
39:34
because they are this is a spiritual
39:36
part of you
39:37
not talking about your flesh your flesh
39:40
suit is your flesh seep okay
39:42
until it gets super glued together at
39:43
the end
39:47
that's glorified when you're glorified
39:51
that'll happen one day okay you don't
39:53
get glorified in heaven
39:54
you can glorify when your spirit person
39:58
who moves to heaven while your body
40:00
rests or if it's blown up or eaten by a
40:02
shark or
40:03
burnt up to nothing he knows where every
40:06
cell and molecule of you is this is true
40:08
because some people think
40:09
you can't get cremated say it's cheaper
40:12
say it's cheaper your family member was
40:16
standing right here said why didn't you
40:17
cremate me
40:19
you would have saved money and god will
40:22
still put everybody back together again
40:23
one
40:24
day because is he going to leave all the
40:25
people who were burnt out somewhere
40:28
no no you get your body back say yay
40:36
he's going to look a whole lot better
40:40
[Music]
40:42
your spiritual bodies didn't turn you
40:43
right now you go man i look good
40:47
because guess what everyone says in
40:48
heaven man you look good
40:52
you look funny you look good too
40:56
but they recognize you it says so in the
40:58
bible
40:59
it says you will be known that means
41:02
your images
41:03
you'll be known as you were known on the
41:05
earth so people will know you
41:07
everyone in heaven knows your first name
41:09
everyone's going to want a hug
41:10
say no masks in heaven
41:14
no social distancing in heaven
41:18
no handshakes in heaven
41:22
they give up hugs father abraham will
41:26
probably be the first one
41:29
if you make it to the gate because
41:32
sometimes your family members are
41:33
waiting outside
41:34
the gate when you come up to heaven
41:36
there's a landing place you come
41:38
no matter how they bring you in jesus's
41:40
own chariot
41:41
somebody's chariot a spaceship
41:44
a world war ii biplane whatever people
41:48
come in many different things whatever
41:49
would delight you the most is how you're
41:51
going to be taken some people step in
41:52
the elevator and they just go they don't
41:53
want to mess around
41:56
they're the people with few layers in
41:58
their soul okay
42:00
they got five layers just taken young
42:03
their angels stepped in this spiritual
42:05
elevator
42:06
they step in with the person and up they
42:08
go and they're there they bypass going
42:10
to see
42:10
the whole galaxies and everything which
42:12
he will take you to see if you want to
42:14
so even leaving is an experience is
42:17
a powerful experience
42:21
but you have layers in you and he made
42:23
you that way number one
42:24
spirit soul and body shall we count them
42:27
say spirits
42:28
that's a layer body that's a layer soul
42:32
that's a layer even your body
42:35
has layers right the skin the muscles
42:39
the bones you have layers there's no way
42:42
you can deny that
42:44
you have layers your spiritual layers
42:46
are some of the most exciting
42:49
so people who have a lot of emotions
42:51
down here
42:52
probably going to be magnified in heaven
42:54
your personality gets magnified in
42:56
heaven
42:58
yes the jokes are better okay
43:02
number one there's nothing defiling
43:05
nothing breaking nothing evil
43:06
nothing that anybody couldn't see the
43:09
movies are all clean
43:11
the jokes are clean stay clean
43:14
it's heaven
43:18
most exciting intense beautiful amazing
43:21
that would wonder
43:22
and splendor and creatures you've never
43:25
even seen before are there
43:27
but he made you layer for different
43:29
reasons okay
43:30
so when this layer that you're wearing
43:33
right now
43:34
sleeps or like i said it's melted down
43:36
or whatever happens to it's going to be
43:37
okay
43:38
god got it okay he's got that thing so
43:41
yeah make sure you get cremated it's
43:43
cheaper
43:45
i meant people said i'm on i want to
43:47
give my family member a funeral but
43:49
would have been seventy thousand dollars
43:50
of what i had to create it for seven
43:52
months they're probably happy you did
43:53
that
43:56
because guess what we're all going to be
43:58
back say we'll all be back
44:01
we get our bodies back they will be
44:04
young
44:05
they will be timeless timeless
44:09
there's no time in heaven everyone is
44:12
young
44:14
time doesn't go by okay
44:17
it comes from god time comes from the
44:21
father
44:22
he's in charge of time okay he does
44:25
things in heaven by
44:26
events say by events on god's timeline
44:31
it's whatever event is on there is
44:34
what's happening
44:36
there's an event right now it's not send
44:39
jesus to
44:40
get the people on the rapture rug that's
44:42
not what's on there
44:43
that's way way down way away
44:47
okay say beginning of time i could draw
44:50
a timeline
44:51
all the way down to here
44:53
[Music]
44:54
we still have all of this left at least
44:57
several hundred years maybe more
44:59
i might still be here amen y'all want to
45:03
be here during all that time
45:04
yes are you sure about that
45:07
no i am
45:11
i've not been given an option when i
45:13
said yes to do this
45:14
and my family knows they already know
45:16
i'll be here when they're gone their
45:17
kids are gone their grandkids are going
45:19
the great friends
45:19
i'll still be here i'll make them some
45:21
brownies
45:26
because he chose me for that and i said
45:28
yes
45:30
you know john could have still been here
45:33
say john
45:34
that beloved the one who jesus loved
45:38
will be very scriptural could have
45:40
remained
45:41
and be here right now if he chose that
45:46
god's not a respecter you just have to
45:49
say yes
45:50
and you have to be willing yes is nice
45:52
willing is better
45:54
willing and obedient is what he needs
45:56
okay
45:57
for people who have commissions like
46:00
that
46:00
and that's not even my gift my gift i
46:03
as you look at me i am a photographer
46:07
my passion that i'd rather do 24 hours a
46:10
day if i could would be photography
46:12
i create moments in time
46:16
that's how i look at it i don't just
46:17
take a picture there is no taking
46:19
picture
46:19
if you take pictures around me i will
46:20
correct you hold the camera up
46:23
get the light on it before you bring it
46:24
down if you stand there you're gonna
46:26
have a shadow and all those things are
46:28
outlined
46:29
when i travel and speak overseas people
46:31
always want to take pictures what's got
46:33
a picture of the castle
46:34
all their 15 friends are lined up you
46:36
see the top of the castle
46:38
if i can help you please if you all will
46:41
stand like this
46:42
leave a space for the castle then like
46:44
this you'll all be in it but you can see
46:46
the castle
46:48
because this is what you take a picture
46:49
of right now
46:53
so that's what i am i was sent from god
46:57
in my soul photographer when i go to
47:00
heaven
47:01
i'll have my own studio please come
47:03
it'll be for free which is a joke
47:05
because nothing
47:06
costs anything anyway
47:10
i will for sure have a studio because i
47:12
know whatever gift he made you
47:14
is what you would do in heaven is what
47:15
you love the most that's how heaven
47:18
uprights that's why there's so many
47:19
things to do in heaven does that make
47:20
sense to your head
47:24
well most people thought we would just
47:25
be worshipping you never stop
47:28
because when you see all the things he
47:29
made for you you will worship in the
47:31
middle of the street
47:32
anywhere everywhere you start shouting
47:34
praises to god
47:36
because he remembered all the things
47:37
that you love amen
47:40
there'll be pictures of some of your
47:41
family members in your mansion
47:43
and right now they take pictures that
47:45
you if you lost if they were burned up
47:47
in a fighter
47:48
they'll be in your mountain on the wall
47:52
it's one of the things he does i know i
47:54
saw somebody's mansion
47:56
and i saw siblings they have right now
47:59
and i saw other ones like probably maybe
48:01
i don't know 10 11 12 something like
48:03
that they weren't even born yet
48:04
and i know how many siblings this other
48:07
person
48:08
will have so people's mountains will be
48:11
quite a delight to you your crowning
48:13
room is
48:14
massive because you get more than one
48:16
crown
48:16
[Music]
48:18
he gives them out say he gives them out
48:22
at one time we will throw a specific one
48:26
we're not going to throw all of them at
48:27
him we bury him maybe i don't know
48:34
it's okay to laugh you need to know that
48:37
humor is one of the number one things in
48:39
heaven there is peace people go well
48:42
peace
48:42
be with them they die don't even rest in
48:44
the arms of jesus they're not resting
48:46
[Music]
48:47
they're riding a roller coaster
48:52
they're eating desserts somewhere
48:55
because jesus loves desserts
49:00
honey was his number one thing he ate
49:02
while he was on the earth
49:04
and guess what his cousin ate it too
49:06
right
49:07
what did johnny where's the last thing
49:11
say it loud his family was hooked on
49:14
honey
49:17
jesus loved honey we made that that
49:19
feast for them on the
49:20
shore fish and it was honey
49:25
he loves honey guess what he still loves
49:26
me i have a jar in my pantry that says
49:28
this is for jesus if he shows up
49:32
i'm ready
49:36
and to make this whole thing even
49:37
funnier people don't think they'll laugh
49:39
sometimes you laugh or cry when i talk
49:41
about it sometimes you just don't know
49:42
what to say because your
49:43
your natural brains like blanked out a
49:46
long time ago
49:49
it's going to be in the ground anyway or
49:51
where else it ever is
49:52
but but i was the person in the family
49:56
of 15 who wanted to number one be alone
50:00
in a family of 14 siblings i always
50:03
wanted to be alone was that ever going
50:04
to happen
50:06
do you think it was ever going to be
50:08
about me say no really loud
50:14
i wanted to be alone and i didn't care
50:15
if anybody knew who i was i don't know
50:17
if they knew my name i didn't want to
50:18
hug
50:18
anyone i didn't want to hug anybody that
50:21
won't be kissed
50:22
don't go to italy unless you want to be
50:24
kissed
50:26
if you go to a meeting 500 people you're
50:28
going to get a thousand kisses because
50:29
they don't just kiss you once they kiss
50:31
you on both cheeks
50:36
kiss kiss kiss kiss by these 400 people
50:39
they had four four meetings
50:42
they're making so much for my life so i
50:45
want to be alone right
50:47
i didn't want to be hugged or kissed i
50:50
didn't want anyone to know me
50:51
i knew two people and all of the schools
50:54
i attended all three of my schools i
50:56
knew two people that was it
50:58
i wasn't seeking for people i was never
51:01
part of a clique i was probably better
51:03
off
51:04
i wasn't a part of any of the crimes and
51:06
other stuff i never got into that stuff
51:08
because number one remember i could see
51:09
i saw the demons around it
51:12
you didn't have to ask me what hell was
51:13
involved in heaven was i could see it
51:16
so i didn't want any of that
51:19
so here i am just wanted to be left
51:21
alone that that wasn't going to happen
51:23
in my life
51:24
first of all i had to give myself to my
51:25
family i was always on my parents side
51:27
that made you
51:28
unpopular had 150 pets to take care of
51:34
the person we learned in the bible was
51:36
how to do a funeral
51:38
we sent every one of our pets to heaven
51:40
don't argue with me about that
51:43
i saw them there like every pet we ever
51:46
have is in heaven
51:48
my dad has him on his ranch every time
51:51
he's someone i hear
51:52
these words from my father in heaven he
51:55
gets another one
51:58
that was my dad's favorite words it was
52:00
whatever he said about anything
52:03
he he eat gas
52:08
he gave himself to the world he loved
52:09
his enemies literally
52:11
he loved his enemies it ticked him off
52:15
he loved everybody dragged him in our
52:16
house got him a bed on the floor
52:18
somewhere
52:19
fed them found them jobs got them
52:20
clothes helped them get a house
52:22
that was my dad's part in the world was
52:25
to be the love of god
52:26
my brother rj said he was meant to kill
52:29
wicked people
52:31
we only did one meeting if you never met
52:33
my brother rj you should search for
52:34
someone
52:35
yeah my brother despises injustice if he
52:39
ever was a warrior he's the warrior he
52:41
is the word
52:42
he lives out in the wilderness away from
52:43
everybody so he doesn't kill you know
52:45
half the harvest
52:46
before they get saved but he won't take
52:49
down people who call the police i found
52:50
the criminal you've been looking forward
52:51
such as
52:52
there he is already dad but they all
52:55
know him so you know he's not going to
52:57
hurt anyone that
52:58
that didn't deserve it that's what he
53:00
says our one meeting began together
53:02
he let me go first and i was just
53:04
talking about the love of god in heaven
53:06
and everything
53:07
then he gives her that high i'm rjs she
53:09
was uh she was
53:10
created by god she loved people i'm
53:12
created to kill him it's a wicked
53:16
this is the funny thing we were in a
53:17
block church because almost no white
53:19
pastors that time would invite me
53:20
i might tell you something
53:24
they weren't threatened by me
53:27
because you know their whole culture
53:28
they already had heaven culture right
53:30
yeah and i have a lot about 50 000 black
53:33
friends i love them all
53:34
right and they might guess what
53:36
righteousness truth they want all that
53:38
they do again the line drawing news
53:41
that's what god calls him the lion
53:42
crying news
53:44
but anyway so that's what he said i'm
53:46
created to kill people who would take
53:48
her out
53:48
or kill people who are wicked and evil
53:50
and belong to the devil he gets locked
53:52
on death row
53:53
he's about my height to minister to
53:56
people who are about to be
53:58
taken out yeah and he won't
54:01
not look down he will not look down most
54:03
people won't even go there's like three
54:04
levels of bars between you and the
54:06
people
54:06
he'll walk up to the closest bars he can
54:08
get to put his face right there and
54:09
stare a hole in him
54:11
and he move his eyes he'll just sit
54:13
there and then they'll go like this who
54:15
do you serve
54:17
i started the living god of heaven on
54:18
earth you made you
54:20
carried you before you he gave you
54:21
commission said he earth to bring life
54:23
to people not to hurt them
54:25
you need to know jesus christ because i
54:26
know what hell looks like too and you'll
54:28
burn forever and you won't like it
54:31
they don't know what to do with him
54:33
right he goes and gets all these
54:34
prisoners one to jesus christ
54:37
he won't back down he's certainly not
54:38
back now and i won't tell you what he
54:39
wants to do to those people in the
54:41
barbed wire in dc
54:45
so my siblings are very different from
54:47
each other i learned to love everybody
54:49
no matter where you're from
54:50
where you're at you know i can honestly
54:52
say i love you because god
54:54
in me loves you so our job here is to
54:58
love to share the truth right
55:01
you don't have to force people to get
55:02
saved you can't do that anyway it has to
55:04
be a decision in here right
55:06
and make a decision we just water it you
55:09
know and share and then water it
55:10
somebody else water then somebody
55:12
wins them to jesus christ holy spirit
55:15
draws them say holy spirit draws them
55:20
it would be much harder with that holy
55:22
spirit on the earth okay that's why he
55:24
was sent way back in jesus
55:25
time it wasn't easy to live that either
55:28
but easy to live in the beginning right
55:31
after jesus left
55:33
but it certainly is different now and
55:36
you were made
55:38
by god very specific when he sent you
55:43
he wrote words on the will on your will
55:46
wrote on your actual will sometimes i
55:48
can see him on people's will
55:50
because i'm a seer i see spiritual
55:52
things he wrote words of what he
55:55
wanted you to be what he created you to
55:57
be in the earth
55:58
that book she writes every day of your
56:00
life in you're in a book
56:02
that's there you get it when you go to
56:04
heaven this is what he intended for you
56:06
this is what he purposed for you but
56:08
sometimes the enemy got you off track
56:10
sometimes wicked people did things
56:12
he didn't intent and he he that was not
56:14
his purpose he created the earth so he
56:16
could take you
56:17
from him where you live and when
56:20
the time of conception comes holy spirit
56:22
takes your little spiritual being
56:24
and knits you together to that dot of
56:26
flesh
56:27
that's i knit you together in your
56:29
mother's womb
56:30
that's not putting your arms and legs
56:32
down this nobody on this earth can do
56:34
this spiritual thing nobody
56:36
can even know where your spiritual being
56:38
is
56:39
the spirit of life talked about the
56:41
bible was you
56:44
you wrote in and out on the rays of the
56:46
rainbow from the father they still do
56:47
send me i want to i want to love people
56:50
to send me i want to go to earth for you
56:51
they'll say that to the father all the
56:53
time
56:54
that's what you did you played in the
56:56
river of life inside him he jumped on
56:57
the stones and fired
56:58
a massive gemstones burning with his
57:02
passion
57:03
that's where everyone here came from
57:06
everyone who's on the earth
57:10
came from that place the father carries
57:13
you
57:14
in him in him we live we move we have
57:17
our being
57:18
the prophets and poets of the old have
57:20
spoken of these things
57:23
that means they will show that it
57:25
reveals them where they came from
57:28
everyone no matter what they believe or
57:31
where they're at right now in this world
57:33
came from him
57:37
he is our father we are his offspring
57:41
his heart is that you know him that you
57:44
love him that you receive his son
57:47
so you can be with him in heaven because
57:48
jesus is the way
57:50
back to the father
57:54
and when anyone dies and they are caught
57:56
up to heaven
57:57
jesus meets you he walks you up the
57:59
steps of the throne
58:00
and says to his father here i have
58:02
brought them home to you
58:05
is part of his reward for dying for us
58:09
he knows everything about you still
58:11
loves you
58:12
still wants you has purpose for your
58:16
life here
58:18
this is the thing about the babies this
58:19
is awesome every baby when every baby
58:22
was sent he wrote on their wills
58:24
and by the way he wrote whether they
58:25
were male or female
58:28
yeah some other group can't teach
58:30
anybody that i know they'd like to do
58:31
that too by the way
58:33
they wrote that on some piece of paper
58:35
somewhere
58:38
he wrote in here and when people try to
58:41
be
58:41
some other thing that they're not they
58:44
have great
58:45
conflict in their soul their soul fights
58:47
against them
58:48
because their soul already knows if
58:52
you're male or female let alone what
58:53
your body is saying to you
58:55
they know that's what they were meant to
58:56
be and i have talked to many
58:58
people who switched that and have
59:02
switched back and would all tell me the
59:03
same thing
59:04
i had conflict all the time in my soul
59:06
it would fight and say no that's not you
59:09
that is not you that's not how you were
59:10
made you're meant to be
59:12
i will tell you this there is going to
59:13
be in one of these of god
59:15
millions of homosexuals will get born
59:18
again like
59:19
like in a sudden a way
59:24
and if they had operations they get
59:26
their stuff put back on
59:27
yeah talk about a sign and a wonder
59:31
right here
59:35
he's going to do it
59:38
he's going to do that because he made us
59:41
very specifically
59:42
he made us detailed our personalities
59:46
are different your personality is still
59:47
different in heaven
59:48
you're just nicer if you weren't nice
59:50
down here
59:52
you laugh and control me and you won't
59:54
get to stop it either
59:56
this place isn't heaven they go just for
59:58
the laughter okay waves of it
60:00
come out of places and hit you and just
60:02
roll on the ground you never did that
60:04
get used to it
60:06
practice maybe then i saw a spot
60:11
i was one of those people that didn't
60:12
laugh i was so serious i was serious
60:14
serious with the capital s
60:16
i was serious i was serious
60:19
i wanted everything to be done right
60:20
that was me
60:22
you know when my mom knew she left me
60:23
the house would still be burning and not
60:25
be burnt down
60:26
that i'd know where everybody was and
60:28
they'd be okay they may not be happy
60:29
with me
60:31
but but that was my assignment to keep
60:33
everybody together and keep them safe
60:35
and i i made like 10 sandwiches every
60:38
day for their lunch and helped them with
60:39
homework at night
60:41
then if i was they were sick i've got to
60:42
pray for them and sit with them until
60:44
they were better and
60:45
this was my life this was my life like
60:47
young my life
60:49
and i didn't say no to my parents i
60:51
honored my mother and my father
60:54
i get to do this now i get to have pink
60:57
hair which was ordered by heaven okay
60:59
i get to eat cake i still have to watch
61:01
how much i eat
61:02
okay i celebrate all the time because i
61:05
already know
61:06
i know what my end is i also pretty much
61:08
know what your end is
61:10
and it's because i'm willing have been
61:12
taken back in the past and shown how
61:14
things happen so i can give revelation
61:16
taken forward in the future i've had
61:18
glimpses of the new earth
61:20
and all the other worlds around it
61:24
i've seen father son holy spirit seven
61:27
spirits of god
61:28
melchizedek who is the father's high
61:30
priest and always has been
61:32
he has always had flesh on him i'm going
61:34
to really mess with your mind now
61:36
now has always had flesh before god made
61:38
flesh
61:39
on people on the earth
61:42
he's really neat looking he serves the
61:45
father at the obedience of the father
61:47
he came to the earth became the king of
61:49
salem collected tithes from abraham
61:51
that's why he could see
61:52
him he's also the one who's oh head of
61:55
the tribe of angels that there's a whole
61:57
tribe of angels
61:59
that god put flesh on so you can send
62:02
them to the earth as watch your angels
62:04
not all of them fell everybody says oh
62:06
my god not all of them
62:07
some did some did not they have flush
62:12
that's why they can make offspring i
62:14
hope your answers are getting
62:15
given okay but melchizedek still serves
62:18
the father
62:19
that's his position personal high priest
62:22
to the living god
62:24
the seven spirits of god also serve god
62:27
they serve him
62:28
they are his that means they serve him
62:31
that doesn't mean that they're his seven
62:32
attributes everybody
62:34
every syllabus i've ever seen okay seven
62:36
spirits of god here's the syllabus and
62:37
in five minutes i can tell you what it
62:39
is
62:41
okay how to explain the trinity some
62:43
people can't they think we have a
62:44
three-headed god
62:45
no they have the ability to step inside
62:48
of each other
62:50
father you know son holy spirit
62:53
holy spirit steps in the father jesus
62:56
steps in the father here's the three in
62:58
one
62:59
and that's how he showed me helped up to
63:01
heaven said i'm going to show you the
63:02
three in one
63:03
and they all came i said here we are
63:04
father son holy spirit
63:06
in a couple minutes of time if there was
63:08
time
63:09
i understood what people have tried to
63:11
figure out for years
63:12
when he said jesus said father me and
63:15
you when you and me
63:16
he literally meant me inside you and you
63:19
inside me
63:20
and when they began to create before
63:22
there was anything there was heaven
63:25
the father's house there's nothing but
63:27
the spirits around
63:28
the father would step up where there's
63:30
nothing he would speak
63:32
physical realm jesus stepped out of him
63:35
he was called the word stepped out
63:36
and a drop of water in his hand he
63:39
stretched it into a canvas
63:41
and he wrapped it around just like this
63:44
a huge part of the spirit realm
63:46
and we created the physical round and
63:48
then he began to hang
63:50
the planets on there anything visible
63:53
he couldn't hang physical things on a
63:55
spiritual thing
63:58
that's why spirits can walk through this
64:00
physical wall because the original realm
64:02
supersedes this physical realm which is
64:04
temporal
64:06
that's how he did it and from that
64:08
moment they began to create everything
64:10
in the physical realm we created the
64:11
planets
64:12
they didn't make the sun in the moon yet
64:17
because the first earth when he made it
64:19
the first time was lit with his glory
64:24
millions of years between verse
64:27
one mercy millions
64:31
millions say millions
64:35
i hope that messes up your mind too you
64:37
know who doesn't mess it up it doesn't
64:39
mess up scientists
64:42
they ask the uh i'm not going to say
64:44
astrological
64:46
the astronomy people already have an
64:48
understanding
64:49
that this earth is well well over
64:52
millions and millions and millions and
64:53
millions of years
64:54
old those who dig in the dirt and find
64:55
the dinosaurs and the layers of the
64:57
earth
64:57
they already understand that man man
65:01
man has been here for a limited time but
65:04
the earth itself has been here for a
65:06
very very long time
65:08
so when there's darkness covering the
65:10
earth because of what happened before
65:11
that
65:12
right in the beginning means before
65:14
there was time
65:16
in the beginning was when the earth was
65:18
just a thought in god's head
65:20
when he made the earth
65:23
it was perfect it was beautiful there
65:24
was no sin in it
65:26
he said to watch your angels to watch
65:28
over all the creatures that were on the
65:29
earth the dinosaurs roamed the earth
65:32
there was a water vapor shield around
65:33
the whole earth that put mist on the
65:36
ears because it hadn't
65:37
rained there had been no storms yet on
65:39
the earth there was only one landmass
65:41
and all this ocean was around it how do
65:44
i know
65:45
he took me back in time and showed me
65:47
how he created the heavens and the earth
65:49
and when i explain this to an
65:50
evolutionist they want to know god
65:55
because they have answers to the
65:57
questions they've always had
65:58
what about that footprint they found by
66:00
the dinosaur that was a watcher angel
66:04
who had flesh on him so his footprint
66:06
was in the dirt
66:07
there's no crow magnum man there were
66:08
never there never was a chromatin a man
66:11
okay
66:12
god didn't make people that were half
66:13
ape and half person and put them on the
66:15
earth okay
66:16
we are we didn't come from monkeys say
66:18
we didn't come from monkeys
66:21
say we're made in the image of god
66:24
he's not a monkey
66:28
the angels laugh every time they hear us
66:30
every time they watch the slime pool
66:32
thing
66:32
every time they watch someone talk about
66:34
the big bang they laugh so hard they
66:36
would cry if they could
66:37
[Music]
66:39
because that takes a lot more faith to
66:41
believe
66:42
than god making us putting us here right
66:46
so having this involved very much in our
66:48
lives always has been involved
66:50
the angels are all over in here they all
66:53
your angels are here and most of mine
66:56
are outside because they couldn't fit in
66:58
here
67:02
and god gave me promises all kinds of
67:03
promises just said yes i'll do this for
67:05
you however long it takes i don't care
67:07
he said one day i'll open their eyes
67:09
everybody will see the angels one day
67:10
i'll take everybody to heaven
67:12
so everybody raise always do this raise
67:13
your hand up
67:15
say we're ready right now take us for a
67:19
trip
67:21
let's see if it happens not today
67:27
that may seem strange to some people but
67:29
one day it will be happening the closer
67:31
we get
67:32
towards the end and the end for people
67:35
might be
67:36
the rapture but i can tell you this
67:40
all the stuff in the bible is going to
67:41
happen it will all happen the
67:42
tribulation the perilous times
67:44
it's going to happen christening on the
67:46
third jerusalem is going to happen for
67:48
that thousand years
67:49
satan being taken off the earth during
67:50
the time is going to happen he'll be
67:52
back on the earth to tempt all the ones
67:55
who were born
67:56
people lived to be seven eight nine
67:57
hundred years old during that time
67:59
uh if you died at 100 that would be like
68:01
a child
68:03
say timelessness is coming to the earth
68:08
before them
68:12
yes it said that there would be a
68:14
generation of people
68:15
on the earth that would taste of the
68:17
powers of the age to come the
68:19
age to come after this age we're in
68:22
is the millennial age so he's not done
68:26
with this one yet it's not going to end
68:28
okay but there would be people living
68:31
in your time i'm saying over the next
68:34
couple hundred years
68:35
in this time who will be timeless will
68:37
begin not to age
68:39
who will travel to the spirit realm all
68:40
the time rather than the physical realm
68:43
who do amazing signs and wonders for him
68:45
that's why he needs
68:46
this time right now to clean a lot of
68:49
the evil off of the earth
68:51
he can't even send new inventions
68:53
there's inventions that haven't happened
68:55
yet that will actually make our life
68:57
so much easier and so different that he
69:00
won't put them here until the evil is
69:02
pushed back
69:04
say god is not willing to give those
69:07
inventions
69:09
to the wicked if you see his big picture
69:13
about all this is happening you will
69:14
understand
69:15
why all the evil is being exposed and
69:19
it's being exposed
69:20
all over the world why is this happening
69:23
say god's going to clean
69:26
that platform off collard
69:31
so we can step into the greater days of
69:35
glory
69:38
that's why if everything had happened is
69:41
normal
69:43
and there's all kinds of stuff going on
69:44
we didn't know if everything had
69:46
happened as normal on november 3rd
69:48
then a lot of that would never be found
69:50
out it wouldn't be known
69:52
the evil wickedness would still be there
69:54
hiding plotting and planning
69:56
and god isn't going to do some things
69:58
until a lot of them are taken off
70:02
who understands please raise your hand
70:05
if you were god and you had great things
70:06
to send to the earth
70:08
would you allow all that to remain
70:11
and you can see just in our country
70:13
alone how that has interfered
70:16
you can imagine saying no holds barred
70:18
for anybody easier than what you want to
70:21
it would be really hard to have any of
70:22
that happen right
70:25
so he does have a plan it is going to we
70:28
are having justice it will come
70:31
not just here but around the world and
70:33
there's be some people here you will see
70:35
no more see there'll be people here
70:38
say it wicked people
70:42
who will be here no more
70:45
that is his plan amen amen so you're
70:48
living in different days
70:49
this is all different our lives have had
70:51
to be different right
70:53
it's going to be worth it for what is
70:56
coming that no
70:57
man can stop or interfere with and your
71:00
family member is going to be running to
71:02
you to find out who jesus christ
71:04
is there's going to be a lot of
71:06
salvations happening
71:07
because people number one are going to
71:08
know there's a god
71:10
because only god could do all what's
71:13
going to be done
71:14
so on god's timeline we're right there
71:17
at one of his things right now on his
71:19
timeline
71:20
right now we're there so everybody here
71:23
is born because he needs you here he
71:25
wants you here okay
71:26
no one is a mistake no matter how
71:30
you got here or who he sent you to
71:34
he never purpose evil for you or
71:37
harm or tragedy so everybody's seeing
71:40
enough we're going to do oh we're going
71:41
to do a soul checkup
71:43
and i do it for the sake of those who
71:45
probably wouldn't ever do it
71:48
this is available to the body of christ
71:50
to be free of everything that's hindered
71:52
you hurt you
71:53
any tragedy anything that happened in
71:55
your life that you keep having memories
71:57
of
71:58
maybe even nightmares about you won't
71:59
have them no more
72:01
if you're involved in addictions and you
72:04
sincerely lose that addiction from your
72:06
soul he'll come down and pull out of you
72:08
amen and this is something the father
72:12
taught me himself
72:13
it's the first time i actually looked at
72:14
my clock and then he told me that i'm
72:16
going to teach you something and i
72:17
looked at my clock it's all the time
72:19
when i came back it was four hours later
72:23
my staff had been beating on my door my
72:25
daughter come over to see me
72:27
and i didn't answer anybody my body was
72:28
there i wasn't there
72:31
he took me and showed me how he made a
72:33
human soul why he mean it that way
72:36
how important it is to understand the
72:37
fullness of the peace of the kingdom
72:40
i'm telling you about the keys of the
72:42
kingdom that's what this is you call it
72:43
something else he calls it a soul
72:45
checkup
72:45
you should do it all the time i used to
72:49
teach it once and then that was nice
72:51
and i found out a few weeks later no
72:52
this is a lifestyle
72:55
if someone says something horrible
72:56
bashing hurting to you
72:58
you turn around loose those words from
73:00
your soul
73:01
and him will go and it will be to you
73:04
like they never happened
73:06
if you saw traumas if you had tragedies
73:09
if you
73:10
lose that tragedy from your soul he'll
73:12
come down and go shh
73:13
it'll be like it never happened to you
73:16
you can talk about it there's no hurt
73:19
there's no fear
73:20
there's no suffering no matter what it
73:22
was you don't have to have
73:24
that in you he doesn't want it in you
73:26
his explanation to me was
73:28
i don't have time for them to have six
73:29
weeks or six months or six years of
73:31
therapy
73:32
i don't have that kind of time i need
73:34
them free i need them free right now
73:36
that's why i'm going to teach you this
73:37
and if you're willing to learn it and
73:39
train them
73:40
then i will show you who melchizedek is
73:43
you give me promises i'll do this for
73:45
you and i didn't ask him
73:46
i'll do this for you do this video i'll
73:48
do this for you and of course you know i
73:50
said yes
73:52
i know you'd be the whole world i'd be
73:53
training that's okay
73:56
it's the most important thing you
73:57
probably learn other than knowing jesus
73:59
christ you can walk through your life
74:01
with no pain no suffering no fear
74:04
no grief no traumas
74:07
no addictions now it may try to come
74:10
back to you saying nope
74:12
i got rid of you i'm not taking you back
74:14
and the devil will try to bring back
74:16
whatever he can you say nope it's gone
74:19
and i've done this with too many people
74:20
for you to try to tell me
74:22
it doesn't work it does work
74:26
so if you're a born-again believer you
74:28
can do this
74:29
okay so first i always start with we're
74:31
all going to repent and say father
74:33
father i come before your throne i come
74:35
before you
74:37
i love your son jesus christ i love you
74:40
right now i'm going to clean up my salt
74:42
right now i'm going to clean it up
74:44
i repent of any sin
74:47
since my original repentance
74:50
i don't want any of it in me so i'm
74:53
giving it back to your son
74:56
i thank you jesus thank you jesus for
74:59
cleansing my soul for blessing
75:01
my soul that i can be free of all sin
75:05
amen amen now we're going to do this
75:08
soul checkup
75:09
i will list things that you need to lose
75:11
from your soul but if i don't say
75:13
something you can say that yourself
75:15
and everyone does it so nobody's going
75:17
to be figured out
75:18
or pointed out the one thing i will see
75:20
is stuff leaving you
75:22
i'ma the seer i will see jesus come down
75:24
he pulls gray matter out of you
75:27
that's what it looks like it looks like
75:28
gray because you have the light of god
75:31
but if you have darkness in there if you
75:32
play with sin or play with stuff
75:35
and the enemy looks in you he will see
75:37
gray he will go after you
75:40
he'll already go after you so that's why
75:42
number one you don't want to keep it
75:43
right
75:44
he also doesn't want people bashing
75:46
screaming
75:47
yelling because you sound like hell when
75:50
you do that
75:52
our words are supposed to bring life
75:55
yes amen we're here to bring light and
75:58
love
75:59
and life those three things that's why
76:01
you're here
76:02
so if you have anger issues there's
76:04
something in your soul
76:06
that keeps making you do that so you can
76:08
lose anger from your soul it won't ever
76:10
come back again
76:12
don't go watch 10 movies with profanity
76:15
in them
76:16
i have to say this about profanity that
76:18
is hell's language
76:20
you are literally speaking the language
76:22
of hell
76:23
if they hear enough they're going to
76:25
start showing up
76:27
because they recognize those words
76:30
that's why god says no profane word
76:33
should come out of your mouth there it
76:35
is right there
76:35
no profane words should be spoken by you
76:38
amen
76:39
it's not in heaven no one in heaven
76:42
talks like that
76:43
i've been to hell three times and it was
76:45
filled that's the only language they
76:46
speak
76:48
so we don't want to represent now we're
76:50
not here for that right
76:52
and i'm sure you may have good reasons
76:54
to get angry
76:55
or upset it says you can be angry and
76:57
sin not okay
76:59
don't add that to your list we're not
77:02
supposed to wound people with our words
77:04
so please don't bash
77:05
people when people they say this when
77:08
people lash out at you
77:10
they're afraid fear
77:13
causes people to lash out they'll never
77:15
admit that
77:17
they won't even think that but fear
77:19
makes you lash out
77:21
that's what happens and i always know
77:23
that person needs help
77:24
if they're bashing me they need help and
77:27
so that's how i look and that's how god
77:29
has taught me to look at it so
77:32
we should always be here to help people
77:34
if people don't like you or they're mean
77:36
to you
77:36
please forgive them go in a room forgive
77:38
them loose all of it out of your soul
77:40
whatever it is maybe teach little kids
77:42
do this
77:43
even little kids if they're if they're
77:45
bashed at school or bullied at school
77:47
you as their parent can lay your hand on
77:49
their head and say as a watcher over
77:51
their soul
77:52
i choose to loose from my child's soul
77:54
all the hateful mean
77:55
ugly words that were spoken to him today
77:58
i loose them in jesus name and jesus
78:00
will come down and pull them out of the
78:02
soul of the child and those children
78:04
will act like it never happened
78:07
you have the right to do that because
78:08
you're the parent amen
78:10
so this is something you can live do for
78:12
the rest of your life
78:14
when something happens immediately to
78:16
you that's the best time to do it
78:17

78:19
somebody but don't let that grief still
78:21
be there a year two years three years
78:22

78:32

78:38

into the hands of jesus to complete
78:48
whatever destiny he has for them in
78:49
heaven

day of your life
86:15
you choose to be happy you choose to be
86:18
what god called you to be no matter
86:19
what's going around you
86:21
but when those things aren't in you it's
86:23
much easier
86:24
but if you want the fullness of god
86:27
you can ask for more than just your rent
86:30
being paid
86:31
food on your table you know things that
86:33
need to be fixed or hold us fine
86:35
but he wants you to be more than that
86:38
you
86:38
have not because you asked not
86:41
today we're going to ask to have things
86:44
bound to our soul
86:46
when you do that he comes and he puts
86:48
them in you
86:49
some of them come in waves i see whole
86:52
waves
86:53
of the joy of the lord whole waves of
86:55
his presence
86:56
whole waves of his life so we're going
86:59
to who
87:00
do you are you all ready to ask for them
87:01
yes say i choose
87:04
as an act of my will to bind to my soul
87:08
my soul the love of god the love of god
87:13
the life of god the light of god the
87:16
presence of the lord
87:19
the joy of the lord
87:22
his creativity his creativity
87:25
his expectations yes his validation
87:56
my gift that he gave
88:12
this word i will meditate on all the
88:16
time
88:16
all the time in jesus name
88:22
i bind to my soul the goodness of god
88:27
and it will be
88:28
evident the life of god
88:32

88:54
to release it to the just in the
88:56
righteousness
88:58
that promise my mind to my soul
89:01
by him to my soul sound wisdom
89:05
extreme discernment i can operate for
89:08
him the way he needs to
89:11
be in jesus name so be it
89:15
[Applause]
89:22
amen
89:40
[Music]
89:43
he has great plans for all of us
89:46
and it doesn't depend on your age your
89:49
position
89:50
doesn't depend on anything but one thing
89:53
you belong to his son
89:55
right do you mean that decision to
89:57
accept christ and his sacrifice
90:00
i know a lot about things that happened
90:03
the day
90:04
that he died on the cross a lot about
90:07
what happened
90:08
from the moment his he had his spirit
90:10
leave his body
90:12
i think if he hadn't told him to leave
90:14
he might still be there
90:16
because he did he commanded the spirit
90:18
mentally leave his body
90:20
and his body was taken down it was
90:21
placed in the tomb
90:24
god appointed two angels to be with
90:26
christ
90:27
through many different times in his life
90:29
if it said angels came and comforted him
90:31
it was the same two angels
90:33
that they were always with and they were
90:34
with him in the garden they were chosen
90:36
to bring that cup that cup is a real cup
90:41
the thing he drank all the wickedness
90:43
and evil and every sin and wickedness
90:45
that existed he drank that that's what
90:48
had to be nailed to the cross it wasn't
90:49
just his physical body
90:51
it's what he carried to the cross
90:54
if people ask you how come jesus is the
90:56
only one who can forgive sins you tell
90:58
them that
90:59
he's the only one to drink all of the
91:02
evil of
91:03
every single sin into his being
91:07
and was willing to nail back to the
91:09
cross
91:10
and at that time he can abolish sin
91:13
in our lives when we repent is the only
91:16
one who's done that
91:17
he's the only one who's made that
91:18
sacrifice willing so he is the only one
91:21
that has the power to forgive sin
91:23
and he is the only way back to heaven
91:27
someone else has another heaven good
91:29
luck
91:30
the one i saw belonged to the god of the
91:33
bible
91:34
his son jesus christ holy spirit so many
91:37
angels
91:38
millions upon millions upon millions
91:40
upon millions upon millions upon
91:42
millions of angels
91:43
i've seen in heaven around in heaven all
91:45
over the earth
91:47
they belong to him amen
91:50
he made them for specific purposes
91:52
they're made in tribes
91:53
like there's tribes of watcher angels
91:55
tribes of couriers trying
91:57
of scribes and then there is the army of
91:59
heaven
92:01
that is a whole different creature
92:06
when it talks about the living creatures
92:08
before the throne of god you're pretty
92:09
much describing
92:10
most of the army of heaven they don't
92:13
look normal
92:14
they don't look like human eye and they
92:17
have wings whether you ever see them or
92:18
not
92:19
some are made out of just force i can't
92:22
even explain that they
92:23
they don't have any kind of shape that
92:25
you can identify
92:26
some have eyes some have 30 eyes some
92:29
have eyes all over their body some have
92:30
eyes in the front in the back
92:32
some have two heads front and front
92:36
i'm not going to explain that hello
92:41
hello
92:46
i was present when they brought
92:50
a gift to my grandson when he was born
92:52
and he is a carrier of the love of god
92:56
and he's going to be an athlete who will
92:58
win olympics
92:59
and he's focused he's got two things in
93:01
his life he's so focused i can't figure
93:03
his brain out
93:04
he can run faster than his father or
93:06
anybody who's ever tried
93:08
to beat him but what he will talk to you
93:10
about
93:11
is the love of god he was assigned these
93:15
two angels who were one being and their
93:17
names are passion
93:18
and compassion and they're with him all
93:21
the time
93:23
he has other angels who are with him uh
93:25
his main angel's name
93:26
is flash
93:30
your number one angel assigned to you is
93:32
because of the gift
93:34
you have mine is about 40 foot tall i've
93:37
never seen him
93:38
when i was a little tiny thing i could
93:39
see him following me around all the time
93:42
i apologize to him all the time
93:44
you probably shouldn't have heard me say
93:46
that i'm sorry
93:49
then he grins at me sometimes he rolls
93:51
his eyes at me but not often
93:54
he's there to protect me to watch over
93:56
me
93:57
sometimes he'll bring me things from
93:58
heaven and but
94:00
but this grandson's angels always uh oh
94:04
i know all my brain kids angels actually
94:06
speak to them hi thank you for watching
94:08
over them
94:09
you know they're going to be going here
94:11
i know you know that but
94:12

94:20
the first one is the first friends and
94:22
is very creative he started making trips
94:24
to him when he was three
94:26
he seen my dad talk to my dad described
94:28
my dad he never met my dad on the earth
94:30
my dad keeps giving his favorite candies
94:33
candies were around in the 50s that they
94:36
don't even have anymore
94:38
he's gone inside of a volcano in heaven
94:40
and rode the lava hound
94:42
with my dad he described
94:45
cars that could drive up the side of
94:46
mountains without wheels
94:48
they exist in heaven i never told him
94:50
about that
94:51
he's been making trips now for five
94:53
years
94:55
and he'll just say the most surprising
94:57
things come out of his mouth
94:58
nobody's saying anything he could lead a
95:01
service baptized so get people saved
95:03
baptized in water
95:04
cast demons out they have never been a
95:06
trim in the public school that was
95:07
probably a good thing
95:08
you'd be down the principal's office all
95:10
the time
95:12
your son just baptized someone in the
95:13
water fountain again
95:17
and he would yeah and the second one is
95:20
over the love of god will pray for
95:21
everybody
95:22
if he sees anyone limp in the store
95:24
anyway he'll run up to them in jesus
95:26
name
95:26
be healed
95:30
and the third one is a girl
95:35
and she would be she will dance and sing
95:38
and there will be weapons she'll be very
95:40
fierce they should
95:41
named her middle name fierce and i got
95:44
two pages on her before she was born
95:46
one whole one and a half pages of how
95:48
fierce it she'll be
95:50
she is fierce she runs for brothers
95:56
she totally understands things from god
95:59
she's for
96:00
sees things here's things her passion to
96:03
worship
96:04
surpasses everything else she's got
96:05
she's all about worship
96:07
singing and dancing and now she's
96:09
wanting to learn to play the violin i'm
96:10
sure that will be very
96:12
dangerous to hell when she does that
96:13
because what you do in worship is
96:15
dangerous against hell
96:18
your prayers are your worship is however
96:20
you do that by
96:23
that's painting danger to how when you
96:25
sing
96:26
dance if you flag whatever it is that
96:29
you do is worship
96:30
you create images that are captured and
96:32
taken before the throne of god
96:35
so she's fierce her angel that protects
96:38
her is the size of a mountain
96:40
his name is rock and he's got this
96:43
little tiny
96:44
person that he follows around you know i
96:47
every time i visit wherever they're all
96:48
at i thank them all the time for
96:50
watching over them
96:52
and so i know their names i know what
96:55
they will be
96:56
one of my rewards god loves children
97:00
she needs children you are not just
97:04
raising a child
97:05
you are shaping souls to the kingdom
97:08
and i talk more about the kingdom
97:10
usually than i do the actual world
97:13
that's why christ came he came to tell
97:16
us about the gospel of the kingdom
97:18
it wasn't just about dying that's just
97:21
how everything begins with you
97:23
ruling and reigning in the spirit realm
97:25
is what he actually has
97:27
for you you rule with him because he
97:30
rules
97:31
we have ultimate authority in this earth
97:34
over this earth over anything in this
97:37
earth
97:38
everything of satan has been put under
97:41
our feet
97:42
we have power over all say all
97:46
the power of the enemy we're going to
97:49
learn how to use it
97:53
we are he's starting something new brand
97:56
new
97:57
right in the middle of all this time
97:59
actually gave all the revelation about
98:01
it on the day of the fake
98:03
inauguration
98:06
it will happen the body will learn who
98:09
they are
98:10
what your authorities in the spirit
98:11
realm how to use that authority
98:13
how to crush darkness push it back it'll
98:15
be a different life to live in this
98:17
world
98:18
amen demons will run from you they won't
98:21
try to attack you they will try to get
98:23
away from you
98:24
because what you carry will cause great
98:27
pain to them yes
98:28
the light and the glory of god is
98:30
painful to the enemy
98:32
that's why when it showed up in hell on
98:34
the third day they were screaming
98:36
their faces were melting they couldn't
98:38
get away from christ fast enough
98:41
that is what it's going to be like to
98:43
live in this world with you
98:46
so you're not unimportant you're not
98:48
just a person you're not an old sinner
98:50
say by grace don't ever say that again
98:53
you are considered royalty in heaven
98:55
your manifested sons and daughters of
98:58
the most high god you are the love
99:02
of jesus christ life he gave
99:05
everything for you that's how much he
99:06
loves you
99:09
holy spirit can't wait to get to know
99:11
you better
99:13
he will share things with you that will
99:14
probably undo your natural mind
99:18
because heaven is not this world
99:21
it's only a shadow earth is a shadow of
99:24
what is in heaven
99:26
and what he has waiting for all of us
99:28
now in this life
99:29
probably won't be repeated again
99:32
what he starts now will continue until
99:35
the end of this age
99:37
and even those christians who would
99:39
become christians during the tribulation
99:41
will be a thorn in the flesh of satan
99:44
they won't be crying they won't be
99:46
hiding when it comes time
99:49
it's going to be executed i've already
99:50
been shown that they will be dancing in
99:52
the line
99:54
which would be the biggest irritation to
99:56
say who finding things
99:57
i'm really going to get them now they'll
100:00
already know they already had trips to
100:02
heaven by that time a lot of people will
100:03
be
100:04
uh it will be normal for people to be
100:06
caught up to have many times
100:07
doing greatest some of the greatest
100:09
things on the earth until things begin
100:11
to switch
100:11
okay i cannot tell you for sure
100:14
that the body will not be on this earth
100:16
when that happens but i will just repeat
100:18
what the word says
100:19
until he that is with hell is removed
100:22
the antichrist cannot appear on the
100:24
earth well i can tell you what if we
100:27
were all here
100:27
he would be able to do nothing he is not
100:31
here anywhere in the earth right now god
100:34
wouldn't be starting these greater days
100:36
of glory with so much
100:37
power of god being seen and felt and
100:39
known in the earth
100:41
satan would not be able to fulfill his
100:43
thing
100:44
his few years his bump in the road
100:47
that's what god says he gets a bump in
100:48
the road
100:50
he won't be able to operate that operate
100:52
like that in those days people will be
100:53
looking for a savior someone who can
100:56
rescue them from the horrific perils
100:58
times
100:58
which will also be a short time they
101:00
will take anybody
101:03
okay so who shows up is the antichrist
101:06
and he's actually going to be good for
101:07
the first three and a half years to fool
101:09
everybody
101:09
he only does all the evil stuff the last
101:11
three and a half years
101:13
and he still won't get the whole world i
101:15
don't know why people think he will
101:17
he won't there's going to be rednecks
101:20
here
101:20
that will not want him that will not
101:24
take satan
101:24
even during the tribulation and there
101:28
will be people
101:28
on the earth when christ comes to sit on
101:30
the thorn in jerusalem that didn't die
101:32
even during that time
101:34
and they will have a long time to make
101:37
their decision for christ you
101:39
have still have to get saved even during
101:41
the time when christ is on the throne
101:43
and some of those kings how about this
101:46
want one in there
101:47
knowing he's the son of god knowing he
101:49
will actually control the weather and
101:51
all these other things he will sit as
101:52
king of the world
101:54
and they will want in there so the satan
101:57
is loosed
101:57
1 000 years later out of the pit he will
102:00
have no authority or
102:01
power in the earth for that 1000 years
102:04
christ will have holy
102:05
ruling in the earth there will be people
102:07
who survive the tribulation that will
102:09
live
102:10
here during that time so
102:13
sometimes you'll understand things
102:14
sometimes you had a big picture given to
102:16
you right now
102:17
we still have a long way to go but at
102:20
this point
102:21
in history in heaven and on the earth
102:24
are the
102:24
greater days it's not the darker days
102:27
amen
102:29
i know some pastors if they don't have
102:31
revelation and they don't know what's
102:32
going on they always go to the end
102:35
this is the tribulation everybody get
102:37
ready for all this to happen
102:38
it's not going to happen evil is not
102:40
taking over this world right now it's
102:42

102:44

02:31
well I don't know about you but I'm
02:33
really expecting it's been a great day
02:35
today so far and we haven't seen
02:37
anything yet and so again we want to
02:40
welcome you to the Healing Rooms
02:42
Apostolic Center and you know I I just I
02:47
always say this because it happens
02:48
almost every time we meet together you
02:50
just may be healed it happens in the
02:53
glory here all the time we have so many
02:55
angels here on assignment and I just I
02:58
just got a feeling some of New York and
03:00
just going to get healed you know a lot
03:02
of times it happens during worship
03:03
happens during the word and so we
03:07
definitely haven't opened heaven and
03:08
this is a place where miracles happen
03:10
so when you feel the presence of the
03:12
Lord we like to say it like this just
03:14
reach out reach out and touch him and
03:17
receive your miracle tonight all right
03:23
it's been excited we were living in
03:27
supernatural times and this has been a
03:29
supernatural week I'm sure every
03:31
here knows that Paul Kane went to be
03:34
with the Lord last Tuesday evening and
03:36
today was the afternoon when his body
03:39
was laid to rest in Santa Maria and just
03:43
different the signs and wonders
03:44
happening throughout the week and and so
03:47
I know that we're in the midst but we're
03:50
always in the midst of the supernatural
03:51
but it just seems like something special
03:53
and so we invited Kat a while ago and of
03:56
course nobody but God knew that Paul was
03:59
gonna go home and actually be buried on
04:01
the first day when she's speaking and I
04:03
know that it's not a coincidence I don't
04:05
know exactly what it means maybe she
04:07
does but I know stuff like that is not
04:10
just a coincidence so we're really
04:12
blessed and honored Kat to have you here
04:15
again and I'm sure how many of you have
04:17
never been in a live cat care meeting Oh
04:20
a lot of you good you're in for a treat
04:22
so why don't you can make your way up
04:25
Kat you need to come up around this way
04:26
and yeah you ready oh and while she's
04:32
coming up somebody dropped their glasses
04:34
so if that's you you probably can't see
04:36
but here they are when I put them up
04:42
here so Kat
04:43
um well brought those in you don't know
04:46
the Lord's been taking her to heaven for
04:48
several years and showing her things and
04:50
bringing her back and allowing her to
04:51
share with us so let's just welcome cat
04:54
Kirk
04:54
[Applause]
05:00
Wow
05:02
[Applause]
05:06
I know some people know why I'm saying
05:12
that some may not when the army of
05:16
heaven goes to battle against the
05:18
darkness that is their war cry why
05:25
because they're excited you're gonna
05:28
crush the enemy's plans over you right
05:30
they're gonna crush them they're gonna
05:33
pull down strongholds that have been
05:35
rising against you that's why they were
05:38
created news flash from heaven they
05:41
weren't created to protect heaven they
05:45
were made by the creator of heaven they
05:48
didn't get to kick Lucifer and one-third
05:51
of the angels out then you get to do
05:52
that
05:53
Michael hell them and the Father sent a
05:56
lightning bolt a million megawatts of
05:58
love from himself and took him out and
06:01
then one third of angels went out the
06:04
same way so they've been waiting a long
06:07
time to war on our behalf full time amen
06:13
I may or may not give you scripture for
06:16
that tonight go look it up I think most
06:20
of us know that Jesus was the lord of
06:24
state loud the host is the name of the
06:30
army of heaven yes they're still part of
06:32
the angel tribes but they're different
06:35
in many ways the ones under Gabriel have
06:40
many different positions and jobs in
06:43
heaven and on the earth and they look
06:46
more like us
06:47
they're the ones who look more like us
06:48
the army of heaven mostly does not look
06:51
anything like us they're creatures most
06:53
of them are creatures they're fierce
06:55
looking they're not gonna be pretty boys
06:57
with harps so what the Holy Spirit says
07:02
they're not gonna be pretty boys with
07:04
harps however there was one time when
07:08
they had to take the place of the
07:10
worship angels which were the one-third
07:12
that were kicked out the only ones
07:15
Lucifer got were the ones he was over he
07:17
was over one-third of the angels
07:18
was the worship angels obviously if he
07:22
was the one who led them in worship all
07:24
the time in heaven I'm just gonna give
07:27
you full out Revelation because I want
07:29
to take advantage of all the time I have
07:31
so if you didn't know this he used to
07:33
step inside God to lead worship he
07:36
covered over the very heart of God with
07:38
his wings which were embellished with
07:40
gems he had gems on his back on his
07:43
front people go well he had just a few
07:45
no he had really hundreds of them on him
07:48
and when God made him he made mountings
07:51
like in a ring and every gem was mounted
07:54
and amounting like a ring that you would
07:56
wear like this one here and he was
07:58
beautiful which is one of the reasons
08:00
why he ended up by falling from pride
08:02
from his beauty also he thought he was
08:05
smarter than God and that was a that was
08:08
busted mythbuster it's okay to laugh cuz
08:18
you're gonna laugh a lot tonight
08:19
alright heaven laughs every time the
08:23
devil loses down here all of heaven
08:25
roars yes they know what's going on and
08:29
today they were attendants for Paul Cain
08:33
with Paul Cain not talking about the
08:37
body talk about his spirit man everyone
08:42
gets to see their own homecoming isn't
08:44
that nice
08:45
so we're colors and play lots of music
08:48
and dance because that's what they'll be
08:51
doing in heaven news flash from heaven
08:54
number two they don't have a funeral in
08:56
heaven when you come home say Amen you
09:01
shouldn't expect one we should have a
09:04
party zone down here when we send people
09:07
off instead of a funeral home someone
09:09
opened a party zone I promise you'll
09:11
make more money than other people with
09:12
funeral homes cuz even the world will
09:14
want to send theirs off wherever they
09:15
think they're going they'll pick a party
09:19
anybody say Amen so that is a witty idea
09:24
I've been giving up for years I don't
09:25
think anybody's done it yet so there you
09:27
go the more real heaven becomes to the
09:32
body of
09:33
people will want to send them off with a
09:35
real celebration because of the reality
09:40
of what heaven is and what they're going
09:41
to be experiencing there it won't make
09:43
sense to have a sad funeral while
09:47
they're watching from the party I'm a
09:51
seer that means I see in the unseen
09:57
realm okay mister
10:01
I'm really happy Danny because I got to
10:04
experience all that heaven was doing and
10:06
what was going on with Paul Kane and his
10:09
mother and his sisters you know his
10:11
family that's up there and the others
10:14
who were attending up there watching his
10:16
service he enjoyed every funny thing
10:19
that was told he likes to be real so he
10:22
liked all the reality of who he was he
10:24
liked that personal side of him being
10:27
talked about so next time you plan a
10:30
family members homegoing service tell
10:33
some jokes because they will laugh I was
10:39
at a service one time and back home and
10:42
it was um trying to member the guys name
10:45
I remember told McClellan he was part of
10:47
story side B and he died suddenly and I
10:52
came into his service I didn't know
10:54
anyone but I was coming to bring some
10:56
books about heaven to his family the
10:57
Holy Spirit told me to and I saw him
11:00
watching from the portal that was really
11:03
difficult you know to try to pretend to
11:06
be sad and I never wear black it's okay
11:12
if you if you go to somewhere where
11:13
they're expecting you know to do what is
11:15
proper not to upset them but no one's
11:19
wearing black in heaven they're not and
11:22
they aren't having to partying there was
11:25
I saw Ron McClellan thank you my best
11:27
friend Holy Spirit he makes up for what
11:30
I don't know you know helps my human
11:34
head lots of times
11:35
because they kind of took that away from
11:37
me I used to be kind of brilliant
11:40
really then they made me like eight
11:42
years old
11:43
life is much easier being that way you
11:46
know what you don't worry about things
11:48
you don't think about what's gonna
11:49
happen five years down the road when you
11:51
don't even know or you already planned
11:54
you know prepare for disasters or
11:55
something I never got that really if
11:58
we're over the weather then we shouldn't
11:59
be concerned about the weather we rule
12:02
over it amen
12:03
okay she didn't know news bulletins
12:06
number three writes number three are you
12:07
keeping track you're gonna get a gift
12:11
number three
12:13
Jesus was over the weather we are joint
12:18
ears we get to be over the weather and
12:20
that great you're gonna see that more
12:23
and more I'm serious you're gonna see it
12:25
more and more things stop like stop
12:27
can't wait for that to happen
12:30
meteorologists might have to get another
12:32
job not making fake news by the way
12:37
they don't work now and it's not gonna
12:39
work when it's not actually happening
12:41
what was I talking about
12:46
number three boys over over the weather
12:52
Jesus was over the weather and he tried
12:54
so hard to teach his disciples he really
12:56
was in case you didn't know they were in
12:58
boot camp with him for three years it
13:01
wasn't just watch what I do
13:03
it's learn what I do and then do it
13:06
right he was gonna go he's gonna go back
13:09
for some R&R and he had to make sure
13:13
they understood how this whole thing
13:14
works being a joint heir with Christ
13:17
what do you have we have he said so
13:19
himself the things I did how point-blank
13:22
can you get the things and the works I
13:25
have done you will do well you forgot
13:30
the first part you will do also okay
13:34
these are just the works you got to do
13:36
the works say we got to do the works
13:40
then we get to do the greater say it
13:44
louder okay like you're excited well I
13:50
don't just try things I actually do them
13:54
there's a difference I'm just gonna try
13:57
that means you're not making much of a
13:59
plan about that right but doing it the
14:05
works I did you will do they do also and
14:11
greater works you will do I think that
14:18
means we're socially doing something
14:22
we're entering into a busy season a busy
14:26
season operating in the supernatural not
14:29
just talking about it a busy season
14:32
handling the wealth of the wicked not
14:34
just talking about it a busy season
14:38
living not just existing doing the more
14:43
say the more the more is amazing are you
14:49
getting better I am just as passionate
14:56
about living holy as I am about being
15:00
funny and I will tell you I I have to I
15:04
have to give you both sides of heaven
15:07
there's two sides in heaven there's holy
15:10
profound the other whole half of heaven
15:13
is funny say funny everybody have
15:19
they've thought for ever and for ages
15:22
that it would be boring in heaven maybe
15:24
because all they do is worship let me
15:27
tell you you stand in front of him it's
15:28
not boring
15:30
whether you're staring feeling like
15:33
you're going to faint melting to the
15:34
ground you know you feel like you don't
15:37
have breath in you because of just being
15:39
near him yeah it is an honor a privilege
15:42
and amazing when you worship and it's
15:44
not normal not even worship as normal in
15:48
heaven you ride on it you create things
15:53
as you're worshiping him you're creating
15:56
when you worship given the devil a big
16:00
black eye and a very bad day when you
16:04
worship Him you are shredding bashing
16:07
and crushing his fake little wannabe
16:09
Kingdom
16:10
in the second heaven when you worship
16:12
Him it's amazing from doing one thing
16:17
for him to honor him to bless him to
16:21
adore him
16:22
what destruction you do against the
16:24
kingdom of darkness that's my favorite
16:27
second thing I don't do demons I do do
16:34
Jesus though I love him I honor him I
16:38
can't do anything without him it's
16:40
because of him and with him and it is
16:43
his plan even the pink hair is his plan
16:47
because he's not boring there's nothing
16:51
boring about him there's absolutely
16:53
nothing boring about heaven there's
16:55
nothing boring about our future
16:58
that's like in the next few days the
17:03
more you believe things are real the
17:06
more real they will become and that is
17:10
actually a spiritual truth it's a spirit
17:13
realm truth the more you believe it is
17:15
real and talk about it being real and
17:18
write about it being real and actually
17:20
acting in it being real the more real
17:23
it's going to become to you it's the
17:26
original realm it's the eternal realm
17:29
it's not the temporary realm this is a
17:32
temporary life for you
17:33
it's a temporary place to live a
17:36
temporary to do things because this
17:38
earth is not eternal I know people have
17:41
worked it out in their own mind with
17:43
their head research and they're looking
17:45
up stuff and sometimes assuming because
17:49
I've read a lot of translations and
17:51
someone kind of miss it I know because
17:54
the Holy Spirit shows me those
17:55
scriptures then he'll show me 30
17:58
scriptures of it being translated I take
18:04
the word for the value it gives it's
18:07
real it is for us to repair us to
18:12
accelerate us to propel us into high
18:15
places you never dreamed of doing things
18:18
you never dreamed of we are living
18:21
examples of the
18:23
Father Son and Holy Spirit on this earth
18:26
that's why you're here you here to be
18:29
like them look like them and act like
18:32
them I don't see any failure in any of
18:36
that I don't see hopelessness
18:38
worthlessness I don't see fear at all
18:43
one of the first things the Holy Spirit
18:45
gives me these Kingdom quotes it's what
18:47
we decided to call him there's so many
18:49
we don't know what to call and we didn't
18:50
just say a quote the Holy Spirit is a
18:52
Kingdom quote was don't let fear
18:55
interfere that was a good one right
19:00
teach me never to fear never say never
19:03
at all in any way fear does not control
19:09
our life we do not partner with fear he
19:12
didn't put fear in us when he made us
19:16
we're supposed to be fearless and
19:21
timeless everybody should be yelling I
19:24
receive it say timeless we're supposed
19:31
to be timeless he said you had to die
19:38
I'm being serious not funny now serious
19:42
John didn't have to die did he say no
19:52
didn't Jesus say to the disciples what
19:55
is it so in other words he's saying it
19:56
doesn't matter what they think
19:58
you probably actually said that he's a
20:01
character he's the son of God but he is
20:04
a character the problem with the biggest
20:06
characters in heaven except for Holy
20:07
Spirit Holy Spirit has gotten beat by by
20:09
that much who they called the drama King
20:14
Jesus is the king of kings Holy Spirit
20:19
is a drama King you haven't only seen
20:22
just a little bit of his activity so far
20:24
waiting to the full fledge release on
20:27
this earth
20:30
he's excited he's excited about what's
20:34
about to happen in us they've been
20:37
waiting a long time say they've been
20:38
waiting a long time if I say the word
20:42
day I mean the Trinity they're not
20:46
boring
20:47
none of them they know how to step
20:50
inside of each other and be one one
20:52
thing that's how it happens I know I was
20:56
eight years old father caught me up
20:59
before the throne and said I'm going to
21:00
show you how the three can be one and a
21:03
five-year-old can understand that man's
21:05
head knowledge has expanded it and
21:08
expanded it and all kind of could use
21:10
every other kind of word explaining that
21:12
you know multiply it whatever you want
21:13
to call it made it look amazing powerful
21:15
and hard to understand it's simple they
21:21
can step inside of each other Jesus said
21:24
father I pray that one day that they be
21:27
one even as we are one because he steps
21:31
inside his father all the time when he
21:35
was the word he did the same thing I
21:37
didn't forget I was only on number three
21:40
bulletins by the way I've got some more
21:41
I was the least likely person to anyone
21:49
on this earth would have chosen to do
21:50
this okay I'm from a tribe like a real
21:54
one 15 people in an alligator and an
21:59
iguana innumerable amount of toad frogs
22:02
and lizards and spiders we grew up with
22:06
them in our home I had seven brothers
22:10
what did you think in Florida
22:12
you add that up that's what that comes
22:14
to sell your bike to some kid for a pig
22:17
bring him home wrap him up and close and
22:19
you have a new pet overnight we never
22:23
knew what was going to be in our home so
22:26
I didn't need anyone's opinions I was
22:29
never part of a group or a clique I had
22:30
a tribe God did that to kill me I'm a
22:35
dead person standing before you dead
22:39
people are wonderful for God to use
22:42
they're not full of self they don't have
22:46
their own opinion and the devil cannot
22:49
use a dead person the more dead you are
22:54
to yourself the more dangerous you are
22:57
against hell there are many ways to kill
23:02
me
23:03
before I even grew up and you know it
23:06
doesn't matter I mean I love everyone in
23:08
this room I loved all my siblings I
23:10
survived I conquered I was a leader
23:13
wasn't liked all the time but I was a
23:18
big help to my parents I honor my
23:20
parents greatly every day of my life I
23:22
loved them I didn't want to hurt them
23:26
they needed help say parents they need
23:31
help pastors they need more help
23:39
I'm grateful people can start a church
23:41
Oh No I've already died I don't need a
23:45
church I don't need a whole
23:47
congregations of people although I love
23:50
them I bless you all but I really bless
23:53
the pastor because they die every day to
23:58
be that amen
24:00
you'll notice that God didn't actually
24:04
send his son to be a pastor did you ever
24:07
notice that they actually sent him as a
24:10
businessman
24:11
God loves business people they're easy
24:14
they know how to listen they know how to
24:17
complete things that are given to them
24:19
they don't leave things out forget
24:20
things ignore things they do a job amen
24:24
so he sent his son as a businessman who
24:26
could easily connect with the sinners
24:30
and he did they ate with him all the
24:34
time they liked him he was exciting he
24:38
was interesting he was funny his
24:42
favorite job was to offend the hierarchy
24:47
he was good at it
24:50
and yet lived holy did miracles raise
24:54
the dead they took money from people for
24:57
spotted lambs they weren't high on God's
25:01
list and he had to train his disciples I
25:12
know he only had him for three years and
25:15
I think most of them finally got it
25:17
after he left but they did give him
25:21
credit they did but in the beginning I'm
25:25
sure Jesus would go to the Father when
25:27
he went to the mountain all the time and
25:28
say are you sure I have to that fight
25:33
all the time
25:34
they brawl over women I have one who
25:38
wants to be everything until everybody
25:40
that that would be Peter I have a
25:43
treasure you know that cheats all the
25:45
time right you know that you know he
25:48
takes money all the time I know you know
25:50
that too
25:51
and I have a tax collector and every
25:53
time you walk down the road to go
25:55
Minister we get stones thrown at us
25:56
because they don't like him I don't know
25:59
anybody who likes tax clusters they
26:01
didn't back then either so he did not
26:05
give him the best or the easiest to
26:08
Train and I know I was saying something
26:12
to God about my some of my staff and he
26:16
said I didn't make it easy for my son in
26:18
my conversation ended with that subject
26:22
especially when he caught me up me took
26:24
me back and I got to walk through a
26:26
whole day of their lives
26:28
like in their first year of being
26:30
together all right God I can make it God
26:38
has a plan for you every single person
26:41
is important to him and I do know this
26:44
your birth was timed on this earth God
26:50
created time he knew you before you were
26:53
born because you played inside of him he
26:56
saw you if there was time he saw you all
27:00
the time how great is
27:03
see that he was huge he could make
27:05
himself as big as he wanted to and he
27:07
walked on the mountains he was out where
27:10
there was nothing and he spoke and the
27:12
world would step out of him and make
27:13
space that God would make himself small
27:21
enough to step inside himself and play
27:23
with you he did say he's not a man he's
27:32
God and even being that great he knew
27:36
everything about you knew the mistakes
27:40
knew our faults knew everything that had
27:43
great hope and great plans for you to do
27:47
great things so it's no mistake you're
27:49
here now in this age instead of the ages
27:53
before this time you're here right on
27:55
time for the accelerator time for the
27:59
more of God for the kingdom age for the
28:05
time to command the hosts of heaven
28:07
handle the wealth by host cities for him
28:12
to use because he's not poor he knows
28:18
the names of your children that you'll
28:20
have even before you get married he
28:22
knows them and he put them in your
28:25
family line on purpose in this
28:29
generation that's here now this is a
28:31
special generation for God it's the
28:34
beginning of the group and type of
28:36
people that will remain until all things
28:39
be fulfilled some well the Bible says
28:47
there'll be a group of people like that
28:48
a group and type of people a generation
28:51
that we're generation means a group and
28:54
type of people it doesn't mean like 30
28:56
years or actually that word in the Bible
28:59
that says Jesus says that there'll be a
29:03
group and Type O people on earth that
29:04
will be here when all things be
29:05
fulfilled including the coming of him
29:08
that word means a group and type of
29:11
people that work generation means that
29:14
there will be a grouping type of people
29:16
on this earth that also says in the
29:18
Bible that would taste of the powers say
29:21
powers of the age to come that would be
29:29
the Millennial age of course there's
29:32
people now let's say they're not going
29:33
to be in millennium I go about what the
29:37
Bible says there will be a millennium
29:40
there will be a Tribulation God caused a
29:43
bump in the road it will happen that's
29:48
on his timeline in heaven so no matter
29:53
what other people have come come up with
29:55
or assume or have putting in
29:56
translations I promise you it's going to
29:59
happen and you can't make it happen or
30:01
not happen anyway so to me it's not
30:02
worth agreeing over God's gonna work out
30:06
his plan all the way to the end right
30:09
I'm excited to know that I'm part of
30:12
that generation that will tasted the
30:14
powers of the age to come
30:16
that's why you need revelation because
30:21
that that all that comes from the heart
30:24
of God he already knows what it's going
30:27
to look like she knows what's gonna
30:28
happen
30:29
so he chose you to be here to be a part
30:32
say Amen that word means so be yet might
30:39
as well say it gonna happen there's no
30:43
one on the earth in the earth around the
30:47
earth say it's round I gotta say that
30:50
the Holy Spirit won't let it go okay so
30:54
that's him say the earth is round not
30:59
flat they don't have edges you may say
31:03
that property does not have edges there
31:05
you go
31:06
Holy Spirit truck can we use proper
31:08
grammar Ben m8 that's how they say it
31:14
there is a whole group of people that
31:16
sincerely spend so much time and money
31:20
to try to prove the earth is flat I'd
31:23
rather use that money in that time and
31:24
energy ruling
31:26
right I've flown many times and I didn't
31:31
get halfway around the world then all of
31:32
a sudden here's the flat earth and I'm
31:35
flying it didn't all of a sudden go wait
31:36
shh now you're on the other side no I
31:40
went around besides I've already been up
31:44
over the earth it's round
31:48
God made it round he says he sits on the
31:52
circle of the earth not the square you'd
31:58
be surprised how serious they are they
32:02
think NASA has spent billions of dollars
32:04
faking it and none of that stuff is real
32:08
I don't know who got that thought but it
32:11
didn't come from heaven a man so just
32:17
rest assured that it's around okay been
32:21
there seen that it is round and when I
32:24
almost shown it God caught me up in
32:25
space up and do like like first space
32:28
not I've been way up there but the first
32:30
time he caught me up and showed me the
32:32
earth he put a grid you know like a grid
32:35
you know what that is yeah a grid was
32:38
round and he put it right on the earth
32:40
cheol-ho together and then they begin to
32:42
draw things on this grid that was his
32:45
plan that was called space planning that
32:47
was also the Holy Spirit's joke he's out
32:50
in space put the grid than planned right
32:53
uses every opportunity to be funny so he
32:58
did show me his space planning for like
33:01
the next hundred years that was probably
33:06
15 20 years ago when he showed me that
33:09
that doesn't mean the earth is going to
33:12
end in a hundred years
33:13
except been taken further than that and
33:16
no tribulation had happened I know some
33:20
people think it's supposed to be right
33:21
now well if it was it would be people
33:26
get to heaven they all find out man we
33:29
wasted so much time sitting on our
33:30
rapture rug
33:36
she to roll it up put it in the closet
33:43
well you've you've been around a long
33:45
time you realize I went to church
33:48
everyday it was open and every day
33:51
someone said Jesus could come tomorrow
33:54
and in my I'm like little this is like
33:57
little I had these thoughts why would he
34:00
have all these plans in the Bible and go
34:02
okay not forget that we're just all
34:03
going home I mean he gave my dad a long
34:08
plan I mean my dad knew him he gave him
34:11
a long plan I mean he's not going to
34:12
where we haven't done what God told us
34:14
to do yet
34:15
and God said well many people are in
34:18
fear and they know one day that will
34:21
happen so they want it to come so to
34:24
them that's logical they don't
34:25
understand a lot especially in the book
34:27
of Revelation say revelations means
34:31
revelations that means something you
34:35
don't know so God said I'm calling you a
34:39
Revelator me you know why he did that so
34:41
people couldn't call me a false prophet
34:43
they don't know what a Revelator is so
34:45
they didn't never say nothing against it
34:50
they couldn't say well she's not a
34:54
terrible pastor no he can't call an
34:57
evangelist she doesn't go out and win
34:58
lots of millions we can't call her that
34:59
huh can't call her prophet she's a
35:03
Revelator don't know what that is so
35:04
we'll ignore all of that a Revelator is
35:10
someone who reveals like John did caught
35:14
up showing the future the future no know
35:17
what that was that was a bling glitch
35:19
write that down and don't forget it I
35:21
know Jen is writing it down right now if
35:25
I say word she goes you did a bling
35:26
glitch that means you blended some words
35:28
together okay I won't explain it yes
35:35
you've been there I'm sure people been
35:37
there right you've been there well at
35:40
least I'm not talking about noses
35:42
putting the animals on the art tonight
35:44
that's Moses and Noah doing it together
35:50
when Donna even said Adam did it I did
35:55
hear from people I have a bloopers thing
36:00
one day and just put them all on there
36:01
go there and look at it but now I forget
36:07
we're talking about who is listening
36:12
Revelator you're right so see I hear
36:22
them all the time I have to fight when
36:25
you're eight you need help so he didn't
36:31
pick me to be a professor you know I was
36:34
graduated middle of my class like
36:37
literally middle we had six hundred
36:40
graduating students we have a lot of
36:43
people coming to Florida to go to school
36:45
I guess they like it we're pretty
36:47
laid-back there you know and so it's a
36:51
nice place to live if you want to come
36:52
live someplace different go good
36:55
vacation time try not to come in August
37:00
really hot so being a Revelator's a
37:07
little bit different that usually
37:09
doesn't mean profit just so you've
37:10
wondered you know John was a men and
37:16
it's okay I love doing that but I love
37:20
being with my father my heavenly father
37:24
him all the time I know why Jesus loved
37:29
him so much I know why he wanted to be
37:31
with him I know why he went away to the
37:33
mountain to spend time with him I know
37:36
how hard it was for him to leave home
37:37
and come here okay he was not poor he
37:42
didn't live poor say Jesus was not poor
37:48
he became poor when he left heaven
37:52
because heaven is certainly not poor
37:56
there's nothing poor up there nothing
38:00
splendor and wandering beauty you
38:03
couldn't afford to build the house that
38:05
you're mentioned that your mother lives
38:07
in you wouldn't even have the right
38:10
substances to make it the walls sing
38:15
literally they sing they leave you go on
38:18
tours come back they sing hello to them
38:21
the trees uproot their self and they
38:23
come and sit in your house and be your
38:27
friend for a while they'll go back to
38:29
the friendly forest is this ok it's not
38:36
gonna be normal no you can't be normal
38:41
you've been going to heaven for 20 years
38:43
you be normal to heaven they tell funny
38:48
stories a lot Bob Jones hasn't stopped
38:57
most people when they go there no matter
38:59
how they were here they're all happy
39:01
they love jokes they love to tell funny
39:03
stories hear funny stories they love it
39:06
they make plans for people before they
39:08
come they knew Paul was coming they all
39:15
knew Paul is coming there's a place you
39:19
go in heaven where you find that out and
39:24
you go in this beautiful amazing
39:26
building and these supernatural monitors
39:29
much better than ours but these are good
39:32
and you can see who's coming home who's
39:35
about to come home to heaven everybody
39:37
starts getting things ready they're so
39:38
excited they're there beside their self
39:40
they want to make sure they're all there
39:42
say all to meet you at the gate they
39:48
have a huge celebration they plan one
39:51
themselves heaven plans one the throne
39:53
room plans one people have celebrations
39:56
in the street over someone coming home
39:59
stay home it's because that's where you
40:03
came from we were alone to the earth for
40:07
a while when you go home
40:09
you are really home and you're not dead
40:13
they don't throw parties for people who
40:16
aren't alive they have huge celebrations
40:21
lots of music lots of food everyone
40:25
meeting one another
40:26
visiting Jesus welcomes you if he isn't
40:31
taking you himself sometimes he does
40:34
take people he comes into his own
40:35
chariot flaming horses picks you up and
40:38
takes you up to heaven then when you get
40:42
out you see the sea or the mass of
40:44
people waiting to greet you and then
40:49
Jesus walks you up the steps of the
40:51
throne to give you back to the Father
40:54
and then the father reaches out of that
40:58
glory that moves in and out of him the
41:01
Living colors of the bow coming in and
41:04
out his eyes flames of fire passion for
41:07
you just glowing and he reaches his arms
41:11
out and grabs you he says welcome home
41:14
my son welcome home my daughter you go
41:17
home as his children say we are his
41:20
offspring every morning gets their own
41:24
mansion you don't have to share it with
41:27
your brother or sister I'll have my own
41:31
one day it's made exactly the way you
41:37
would love it but it's made with his
41:40
presence in the walls and the floors and
41:42
it's not gonna be a normal shape trust
41:45
me it's not all your pets to be there
41:47
they'll be waiting to greet you eating
41:51
your food at your table your family
41:59
members will all have gifts for you for
42:01
every year you've been apart they will
42:03
get a gift that represents that year and
42:05
put it in your mansion after your
42:08
welcome home party in the throne room
42:10
which could last for quite a while
42:13
your family will come get you and take
42:16
you to your own mansion then they'll
42:17
have another celebration
42:22
everybody laughs and filled with joy to
42:27
see all the ones they loved before
42:29
little tiny babies they never got to
42:31
raise they get their children given to
42:33
them to raise the same one that you that
42:37
didn't make it all the way through amen
42:41
God keeps them they live with your
42:44
grandparents or whoever when they get
42:46
there they'll go get them and help raise
42:48
them for a while I love the story of a
42:51
mother they lost their son he was either
42:55
7 or 8 he was hit by a car and they of
42:59
course they they grieved over him but
43:01
knew he was in heaven and I think it was
43:03
like 20 years later or 30 years later
43:05
one of the other huh
43:06
she died on the operating table and was
43:10
caught up to heaven saw her
43:12
seven-year-old son playing in the
43:15
streets of gold he goes mom Wow mom
43:18
you're here this is so exciting
43:20
your mom I'm so glad you're here and you
43:22
cuz what have you been doing goes I've
43:24
been playing with my friends what you
43:25
think I've been doing he's been living
43:29
with his grandfather and playing with
43:31
all these friends and the streets to go
43:33
they were playing and he was laughing
43:35
and he said but you can't come yet
43:37
because it's not your time
43:38
and so she came back never forgot it and
43:43
her and her husband went around the
43:45
world talking about it you will be known
43:48
as you are known except you look better
43:53
like a whole lot better you'll have hair
44:01
most guys wear their hair about down to
44:04
their shoulders don't have you know
44:06
that's gonna change y'all I'm just
44:08
letting you know I can't change guys
44:10
unless you really want like a buzz cut
44:13
or something no Marine Corps or my
44:18
husband may still have one I would might
44:20
be surprised to see him alive yeah he's
44:25
still with me by the way another way to
44:26
kill me but that was okay
44:34
it's all worth everything it's worth it
44:40
all no matter what you surrender give up
44:44
miss doing it's worth it and you'll be
44:49
so happy when you stand before God and
44:52
you're welcomed home knowing that you
44:55
gave everything you could not saying you
44:58
have to walk around poor okay that was
45:00
the devil's plan not God's his plan is
45:04
to bless us say bless us and prosper us
45:10
it'll be worth it some people have
45:13
already seen Jesus here right how many
45:15
people have seen Jesus let me see either
45:18
in a vision or dream or in reality if
45:20
you've seen him how many people have
45:22
been encountered an angel there's
45:24
usually a lot there's a lot of people
45:26
here it's going to happen that's part of
45:28
the acceleration that's part of the more
45:31
it's a lot of them more actually that we
45:35
will see angels and they will probably
45:37
be talking to us they came from God
45:41
ignore what we've all been told our
45:42
whole lives don't talk to angels they
45:46
did in the Bible amen
45:49
there's gonna be a lot more of that
45:51
angelic not just visitation because what
45:55
we're going to experience is the
45:56
habitation heavens not coming for a
45:59
visit a heaven
46:01
is not coming for a visit they're coming
46:04
for a habitation you're part of the
46:09
habitation you are all of you sitting
46:11
here say I'm alive and breathing I'm
46:15
part of the habitation but God is about
46:22
to do on this earth does not just take a
46:25
territory here and there what the
46:28
habitation will be is in us say in us
46:34
that's the part of the habitation that's
46:36
why me and won't be able to control it
46:38
like they have in the past say God will
46:42
be in charge
46:45
it's a habitation and it will remain for
46:49
a long time he's gonna transform this
46:53
world right now he is shifting
46:55
government so he can shape Nations it's
47:04
part of the platform he's giving us in
47:06
the habitation
47:07
he's got platforms for us that's the
47:12
place that we will operate from and
47:14
speak from shake things cause things to
47:19
be released to change for him it's not a
47:26
lot of how it's always been in the past
47:28
that's why it's a new thing say a new
47:30
thing it's time for the new thing it's
47:37
where we will be ruling it's one of the
47:40
purposes that Christ died for us that's
47:43
why he went into hell and wasted it took
47:47
back the authority and Dominion the Adam
47:49
had given away he gave it to us he also
47:54
gave his power over all the power of the
47:57
enemy say we have power over all the
48:03
power of the enemy say he did not give
48:10
that to the Angels that's why we need to
48:16
command them they can't just go tear up
48:20
any demon they see they just can't do
48:23
that
48:23
they do it in in the past it was from
48:25
answers to prayer and prayers never
48:27
going to go away it's never gonna go
48:29
away
48:30
he loves prayer prayer is powerful it's
48:33
gonna get even more powerful especially
48:37
when you command part of an army of
48:38
heaven and they pull down strongholds
48:41
for you and crush the plains of darkness
48:46
we need this say we need it
48:49
to rule in this day say every King gets
48:55
the Kingdom and gets an army if we're
48:59
part of the kingdom we get part of the
49:03
army did you ever see a king a natural
49:08
King on this earth title rule with that
49:09
one they wouldn't go very far with a
49:13
they'd be overrun beaten up things
49:17
stolen things killed someone's like the
49:20
devil he comes to kill steal and destroy
49:30
that's what the army prevents heavens
49:35
army was designed created and made every
49:38
one of them unique and different but
49:42
they are fierce they have one job the
49:47
ones under Gabriel have many different
49:49
jobs many different positions to do many
49:52
different things but but Michael is over
49:56
one specific part and that is the army
50:00
they have a headquarters they have
50:02
barracks they have training fields
50:05
they're all in the sky of heaven Rand
50:08
maneuvers for ages in the past Jesus
50:12
would go send up Michael to gather the
50:15
army from the far ends of heaven to
50:18
fight on behalf of Israel people say
50:20
Amen
50:20
it's in the Bible go read it sometimes
50:25
they even fought the flesh did you know
50:27
that yeah some of them could fight the
50:30
flesh in this time on earth it's mostly
50:36
battles in the spirit battling the
50:39
demonic even those in the high places
50:42
the principalities and the powers the
50:46
things the beings in wickedness in high
50:48
places many of those high places will be
50:51
shredded and pulled down say our weapons
50:58
they are mighty to the pulling down of
51:03
strongholds that's one of the things the
51:07
army does I can only share what I have
51:13
been told and I can only tell you what I
51:16
have been shown shown and told that's
51:21
what I talk about but they didn't just
51:24
show me things and tell me things I had
51:26
to live it every way something mom is
51:29
trained in it was for the body of Christ
51:32
so I had to live it to let you know it's
51:36
real and it really does work she follow
51:39
heavens protocol see on earth as it is
51:44
in heaven
51:45
that's what we've been asking for for
51:49
generations we should have expected it
51:56
jesus bushwhacked us all he did he told
52:01
me is it I knew if I taught them that
52:03
and said you say that eventually it
52:06
would come you mean one thing I could
52:10
get them to agree on no matter what
52:14
denomination they rod to clear that
52:17
prayer because they need us to call
52:21
things in is that right you have not
52:27
because you ask not
52:31
if you've ever said to Jesus I'll give
52:34
you anything you want no matter what it
52:36
is where it is what time it is I give
52:39
you permission to use me as anyone ever
52:41
says something like that let me see your
52:44
hands
52:45
well I'll get ready because he's calling
52:51
in those words yes it's gonna be amazing
52:56
say amazing heaven is amazing it's gonna
53:01
be amazing here we can live on earth
53:04
like they live in heaven which is mainly
53:08
his will being done
53:11
his way say his way not our way that's
53:18
part of the more she's gonna do new
53:21
thing he goes revelation and then ways
53:25
for you to use that revelation it means
53:28
a lot of things are gonna change so if
53:31
you're stuck in your own mind or your
53:33
own mindset of what you think is gonna
53:35
happen and because it didn't it's not
53:37
going to you need to just so that away
53:40
because he does have a timeline in his
53:44
own throne room and those dots on that
53:47
timeline is when his things are going to
53:50
happen regardless of what anybody on the
53:54
earth is doing it's his sovereign will
53:57
and what right now this time we're in
54:00
it's on his timeline it is many of the
54:04
generals are going home doesn't mean
54:07
they'll be oblivious to what we're doing
54:10
that means they'll know all about it
54:12
after they get there and the thing
54:13
they'll be celebrating is us who are
54:15
still down here being a part of it so
54:21
God really needs us right now he's
54:34
intimidating me although I probably
54:36
would have never chosen except when he
54:40
asked me I said yes say it's important
54:44
to say yes to being chosen many are
54:50
called but few are chosen because they
54:55
don't choose that's why many aren't
54:59
chosen he can't make you do it right
55:04
you're called you're being called but he
55:07
can't make you do that you have to
55:09
choose yes and when you do that you're
55:11
saying yes I want to be chosen and then
55:14
you're chosen what does it take to be
55:15
chosen say choose yes
55:21
then you got to be willing he makes it a
55:23
little bit you know gotta be willing and
55:25
obedient say willing obedience next say
55:35
surrender is not control a lot of people
55:42
think it is because you know God does
55:45
have he does have I'm trying to think of
55:52
the natural earthward it's like not
55:54
there he does have guidelines is that
56:00
right even Jesus had them that he
56:03
operated by Jesus didn't just pick
56:06
things on his own all the time where did
56:10
he say I do yeah what his father said
56:17
right but he showed him and what he told
56:20
him that's what he did that's why we
56:24
need revelation otherwise we're gonna
56:27
get man's mind set on everything and
56:30
that hasn't worked well has it he's not
56:36
going to abandon the church I've heard
56:39
all kinds of things when people's gonna
56:40
abandon the church it's just gonna go
56:42
away burn down we don't need it anymore
56:45
let's get rid of it when he's not saying
56:47
that to me he's going to set it on fire
56:52
amen this is a time to be willing and
56:56
obedient if you want to eat the fat of
56:59
the land and Jesus did ask us to pray
57:03
about one other thing pray that my
57:05
people say we are his people be willing
57:11
and the day of his power well obviously
57:16
if he's going to give us revelation to
57:18
operate like he does and part of that is
57:22
power
57:22
he says he'll give you power over all
57:25
the part of the enemy there's one right
57:26
there
57:26
he's given us power and he does have
57:31
power
57:33
so if this is the day of his power the
57:36
biggest thing the most important thing
57:37
is remember the willing and obedient
57:38
thing what he asked probably won't seem
57:42
natural or normal to you wasn't natural
57:46
normal to ask me to have pink hair I
57:49
wasn't a pink haired person I liked it
57:53
he wouldn't have asked me it's better
57:57
than camel hair I like pink here any day
58:02
over camel hair it smells it's stiff not
58:09
comfortable and he had to wrap himself
58:11
in it okay my pink hair is a test it
58:18
divides asunder the Spirit from the
58:21
flesh so those who trash or bash it or
58:26
in the flash are we still so walking the
58:30
flash say no we're supposed to walk in
58:35
the so people don't have to tell me if
58:40
they're hearing their flesh or hearing
58:42
their spirit it's the way they react to
58:45
the pink care now people who like pink
58:48
hair they think is amazing so the world
58:49
must be passing their tests because they
58:53
all love it that's amazing you look
58:56
amazing what do you do I'm a
58:59
spokesperson for haven't I've been there
59:02
and then they all say the same thing
59:05
they don't say you're liar your father's
59:07
property was that they go what was it
59:09
like what was it like is it beautiful is
59:14
it amazing is it real is is God real is
59:16
there a god and go oh yes there is a God
59:20
and you lived inside of him before you
59:22
came here okay that makes him interested
59:26
not bashing amen
59:30
try that next time you did live in him
59:36
you moved in and out of him he was your
59:39
very existence you had your very
59:40
existence in him that's why he knew you
59:43
that's why he saw you before he sent you
59:46
here you're wonderfully and perfectly
59:51
made your souls were the most amazing
59:54
parts of you of all you change your very
59:57
life by what you feed it you change how
60:01
you feel about things by what you say
60:04
yourself if you don't like you then
60:08
change change what you're saying change
60:12
what you're watching change what you let
60:14
other people say around you because you
60:16
need to guard your heart what goes in
60:20
there is what you will become
60:22
amen if you've never heard that before
60:26
it's Revelation on your soul your soul
60:28
is what you are people say well I'm
60:32
missing that no Adam became a living
60:36
Saint loud he became a living soul
60:43
that's how important it is to God that's
60:45
why he gave you a soul you could choose
60:47
yourself you could choose with your will
60:50
you can think about things choose it and
60:52
then you do it and then your emotions
60:56
display who and what you believe with
61:00
your life it's probably one of the least
61:03
talked about things in the church it's a
61:06
soul growing up I always heard that it
61:09
was bad and went but God made it right
61:13
he it's one third of us is that right
61:16
we'll always have our soul
61:18
why would he make it bad it's a powerful
61:22
thing and it's a good thing because you
61:25
can feel yourself with God and then
61:26
you'll be like him you can talk about
61:29
him then you really believe he is real
61:32
you can feed your soul 24 hours a day
61:36
your body gets fed a few times a day
61:39
your spirit man gets fed once a week
61:43
most people go to church once a week but
61:48
your souls fed all the time by what you
61:52
watch what you say what people say to
61:54
you you can be crushed by tragedies and
61:57
you can't you can't forget it you hang
61:59
on to it somebody
62:00
you wound and hurt eunuch stays there
62:02
forever your soul has layers and it
62:06
collects things in those layers that's
62:09
why you have a memory but your layers
62:12
are supposed to be used for different
62:13
something different than that every
62:16
layer of you looks like you who wants
62:19
revelation on the soul let me see your
62:20
hand I was shown one and the father
62:26
spent four hours with me earth time I
62:28
never usually know but I looked at my
62:30
clock and I was talking to him then he
62:32
just catches me up and begins to show me
62:35
a human soul what it look like how he
62:37
made it why did he make it that way how
62:39
people can cause her soul to prosper all
62:41
the time and then they live in divine
62:43
health there was a requirement about
62:47
that prospering it says even as your
62:51
soul prospers you will prosper and you
62:55
will be in health that where B means lib
62:59
it's called divine health so I since I
63:05
learned about the father taught me about
63:07
that he said people can loose with the
63:09
keys of the kingdom you can loose things
63:10
out of your soul when you loose it it's
63:13
gone
63:14
and that doesn't matter what it is he
63:17
started giving me this very long list of
63:19
things that you can loose from your soul
63:21
and he said I know most people buying
63:24
the devil but the keys to the kingdom
63:26
but they mostly never talked about the
63:29
loosing thing what are gonna do with the
63:30
loosing key and yet the binding key is
63:34
more important to bind the things of God
63:37
to your soul because then they can't be
63:38
taken away what you choose to bind to
63:43
your soul about God will never be taken
63:46
from you and so people I know you know
63:51
if you still want to bind the devil go
63:52
ahead and do it I'd rather loose the
63:56
stuff out of my soul that he tried
63:57
putting there you know if you have an
64:00
anger issue in your anger anger angry
64:02
all the time you don't even know you're
64:03
just angry it's all it comes out of you
64:05
it's in your soul you choose with your
64:08
will to loose that's that anger then
64:12
heaven comes down and they pull it out
64:14
saywhat sluiced on earth is loosed in
64:18
heaven you know how amazing you would be
64:22
if you didn't have all that junk in
64:23
there especially wounds and wounds can
64:28
keep you from the things of God as much
64:31
as sin can don't leave a wound in you
64:35
because then the enemy will come and try
64:37
to use it amen
64:40
so tomorrow night not tonight we're
64:43
gonna do a soul checkup I hope you're
64:47
coming who's coming tomorrow night hope
64:48
everybody's coming home you don't want
64:52
to miss tomorrow night this is just the
64:53
introduction we're gonna do some
64:57
spiritual warfare with the hosts they'll
65:01
be excited you mean leaving an army if
65:04
you don't have one they were made for us
65:08
amen they won't let you worship them
65:11
they don't have time for that and
65:14
neither do you
65:15
amen tomorrow night we're gonna have
65:19
some fire sent the Angels already
65:22
outside waiting but they're gonna do
65:24
that tomorrow night I did this recently
65:27
where I mean people were literally
65:28
flaming like they were flaming because
65:34
this is time just darkening I want to
65:37
say drops of it the fire of God is
65:41
amazing it comes from himself inside him
65:45
say our God is a consuming fire I'm
65:49
about to get consumed it's one of the
65:54
most asked asked things by the body of
65:56
Christ send the fire I want the fire
66:01
give me the fire let me be consumed let
66:03
me burn for you it burns everything off
66:07
the walls of your heart I mean literally
66:09
make sure your heart white you are
66:15
filled with boldness like you've never
66:16
had before in your life you're fearless
66:20
you're bold you you got filled with God
66:23
the fire it burns it out then he puts
66:28
him in
66:28
selves in there he heaps more stones of
66:31
fire inside of you those came from God
66:35
two stones a fire I find a one
66:39
translation said that they were they
66:41
were flaming stones that Satan left on
66:43
some other planet that was in a Bible
66:48
and I already knew what they were so God
66:51
made me look up like 29 different
66:53
translations to go see what they say it
66:54
is like they missed that one no they
66:59
didn't ever belong to Lucifer okay they
67:03
were inside God or he burns with this
67:07
fire for you under the water they burn
67:11
in the River of Life that's in him the
67:14
river flows out of him the gemstones
67:17
flow out of him even the steps of the
67:19
throne room have gemstones they flow out
67:22
of heaven and become the crystal see is
67:24
called the crystal see because there's
67:26
gemstones in it not sand
67:30
that's why it's cut crystal faceted
67:33
gemstones they're all over heaven they
67:36
all come from one place when the father
67:38
and the firewood burn inside of him and
67:41
Lucifer would step in and there's his
67:43
holy mountain inside God say God is not
67:47
a man he doesn't look the same inside
67:52
that we do but we lived there that's why
67:57
we like sparkly things way back in our
68:01
way back in our spirit man we remember
68:06
that we met we remember that there's
68:09
something that connects when we look at
68:11
something that's brilliant and beautiful
68:13
gemstones represent the love of God his
68:17
love his revelation upon this rock I
68:21
know he said Peter was a rock when God
68:24
says rock in the Bible he's talking
68:25
about a gemstone you know that white
68:29
rock that white rock rock or stone
68:31
you're gonna get when you go home to
68:32
heaven and there's a name under the only
68:34
he and you know it's a white diamond
68:37
it's not a River Rock
68:40
every syllabus I ever saw showed a river
68:43
rock when it talked about that that
68:46
stone so inside his eternity you never
68:52
see at the end there's no end inside of
68:56
him no end and we ran up and down this
69:00
mountain and we slid down the river of
69:02
life and would jump on the stones of
69:04
fire through the flames we lived in
69:07
those flames you're about to get
69:10
baptized with him it's amazing I don't
69:16
even know what time it is I better check
69:17
what time is it oh my my see gem she's
69:31
at it you didn't finish talking about
69:35
Ron McClellan remember I was at his
69:41
service right and I can I come in with
69:44
these books in his parents and
69:46
grandparents are sitting on the front
69:47
row I didn't know him so but I knew a
69:49
couple people there at celebration
69:51
Church they let me come in and I just
69:53
was going to wait till everything was
69:55
over and they were everybody with their
69:57
line going by the casket and he had this
70:01
bright yellow suit on I mean bright with
70:05
his big white tie and and he had the
70:07
biggest fro I've ever seen on a human
70:09
they had to stick it down in the casket
70:12
and as I was walking I was walking up I
70:17
looked up I was trying not to laugh out
70:21
loud because it was an open portal and
70:24
he was watching his service and now this
70:27
is a band right band in a van travelling
70:32
telling jokes non-stop doing sock
70:35
puppets you know crazy stuff he did
70:37
crazy things in the van with the guys
70:39
and his band was there and they were
70:42
telling the funniest stories and every
70:44
time they say something funny he would
70:45
go like this is here we go
70:53
so here I'm looking at the casket and
70:56
then I look up there
71:00
he was alive for now and there was a lot
71:02
of funny stories right so I'm like this
71:04
is just this crazy it was so much fun
71:06
and so I went back sat down and then it
71:10
came up when I gave out the books and I
71:13
didn't know who his parents were I knew
71:15
who his wife was and her mom dad were
71:17
there and I gave them one and I didn't
71:21
know that was his father sitting there
71:22
so I was telling you know his wife this
71:24
is a book about heaven I really think it
71:26
a bless you and I started to turn away
71:28
and and the Holy Spirit to tell me take
71:30
an extra one so of course willing and
71:32
obedient I had an extra one in a little
71:35
bag wondering who was gonna give it to
71:36
and he grabbed my arm II said did you
71:38
say that book was about heaven
71:40
I said yes I I've been there he says can
71:42
I have that book and I said yes yes you
71:45
can have and he goes well I'm Randstad
71:48
well was then this was for you because I
71:51
didn't know you were gonna be here but
71:53
he told me to bring it so this is your
71:55
book and a few months later I get a
71:57
phone call it's always in the middle of
71:59
night and it's his parents and they're
72:02
undone they were so full of joy in
72:04
celebration after reading about what
72:07
heaven was like they already knew what
72:09
their son would be doing having a band
72:10
and he does have a man and it's called
72:12
the other side of the story his heaven
72:17
he went from story side be to the other
72:20
side of the story that was his bayum but
72:23
in the band
72:24
angels were playing and singing with him
72:27
because he said he wouldn't let anyone
72:29
take the place of his band when they
72:31
came to heaven which I told their band
72:34
and so his parents called they were
72:37
really excited about everything and and
72:39
then I they gave me their daughter's
72:42
phone number he and his sister were
72:43
really close together and so I called
72:46
and just spoke to her for a few minutes
72:48
and and then about I don't know it was
72:50
probably a year later she called me she
72:51
goes today is my birthday my 30th
72:55
birthday and I just wanted to know does
72:57
my brother even remember me does he
73:00
still think about me because we had
73:02
planned a big celebration on this day
73:04
we didn't know he'd go home so I while
73:08
she's on the phone to me God caught me
73:09
up to heaven and I saw her brother
73:13
standing at a portal
73:15
this goes sound wild but it didn't
73:17
matter he was throwing Cheetos at her
73:19
from the portal and he was singing the
73:24
worst rendition of happy birthday I've
73:27
ever heard and this is a guy who sings
73:28
sent was singing for a living right
73:30
like me and this that's awful that's
73:33
awful
73:33
and then God sends me back and I'm she's
73:38
still going on the phone I said wait a
73:39
minute wait wait wait wait wait I got to
73:40
you hey I don't know what you can think
73:42
about this but I got to tell you what
73:43
what I just saw in heaven I saw your
73:46
brother and he was throwing Cheetos over
73:49
the portal at you and she starts to yell
73:52
and scream she goes that that's she said
73:57
he even had a throw by he run by what do
74:02
you want a Cheeto throwing whatever he
74:04
had her fro to so he said his greatest
74:07
thing to do was run through the room and
74:10
throw as many Cheetos in her fro that
74:12
would stick there and she said he did it
74:16
all the time and I was so irritated but
74:17
now it's the most precious thing in the
74:19
world that you told me that because I
74:21
know he didn't forget me this is on her
74:23
birthday remember and I said oh I don't
74:25
know how to tell you this but he he
74:26
sounded the worst I have ever heard
74:29
for someone who's anointed to sing she
74:31
said was it the worst happy birthday you
74:33
ever heard in your life I want ya she
74:35
said he did that every year too so she
74:39
was so blessed to find out she that he
74:43
had not changed he still remembered her
74:46
he was still himself and she was so
74:50
blessed by that so now if Jen there Jen
74:53
I finished the story I'm done with okay
74:56
so I want to encourage you to understand
75:00
that your family still loves you no one
75:04
has forgotten you
75:06
they're making plans for you in this
75:10
little vapor of time that we're in right
75:12
now on this earth use it powerfully
75:17
to love to forgive and to be willing and
75:22
obedient understand John
75:26
his last message loved one another that
75:31
should be the thing we do the most amen
75:33
don't forget to love if you get a choice
75:36
forgive people who are bashing you when
75:39
you do that it really does wound the
75:41
demons and it is our time to torment the
75:44
Nieman's say it's our honor and
75:49
privilege to torment the demons those
75:57
demons ask Jesus have you come to
75:58
torment just before our time that meant
76:01
that was going to be a time when they
76:02
would be tormented is that right but he
76:07
didn't do that he gave us power right so
76:12
stand up for a minute I'm sure that Paul
76:20
is still enjoying his celebration party
76:23
it goes on for quite a while I know that
76:27
has something spent planned for him for
76:30
anyone who ever wanders he made it no
76:36
matter what you thought about his life
76:38
or consider for him he loved God he had
76:44
Christ in his heart he made mistakes he
76:47
repented for them amen and he's highly
76:52
honored and recognized in heaven for
76:54
what he did for God and they're happy to
76:58
have him home and so is his mom amen so
77:03
let's make a declaration I love to make
77:05
declarations say father thank you for
77:11
timing my birth on the earth for right
77:17

the more it is my commission I'm saying
77:34
yes right now I want to be chosen help
77:41

77:47
while I do it I asked for and receive
77:53

78:02

79:33
do an impartation tomorrow night I
79:35
really would like to do one tonight I
79:39
[Applause]
79:43
think instead of talking for another 45
79:46
minutes I'd rather do that amen so I'm
79:55
guest tonight because tomorrow night I'm
79:58
probably getting the lightning power God
80:00
last time I did it John G showed up
80:05
that's who I call John G Lake he did he
80:11
came and stood right next to me
80:12
other seers saw him it was really zap
80:16
BAM time but tonight I really want to
80:21
give out a measure of the fire amen I've
80:24
had a measure of baptism and fire and
80:26
let me tell you I've not ever been the
80:28
same so I want you to take it home with
80:31
you let it burn on the inside of you
80:34
don't let the fire go out what you're
80:38
really doing is preparing a place for
80:39
more to come say more say when I receive
80:44
some of something from God I can have
80:49
more
81:03
I know there's major things that are
81:05
about to happen in your lives shifts
81:08
because this is the time to shift
81:10
there's a lot of shifts the other thing
81:13
is suddenly those are two different
81:17
things a suddenly comes when you least
81:21
expect it but just one suddenly can
81:25
change your life it will fill you so
81:28
full of faith when God moves his hand
81:31
for you it's always a good thing
81:33
say suddenly are good things because God
81:39
is preparing you to receive more of him
81:42
amen suddenly just send you over the
81:46
edge probably about half the time
81:52
suddenly czar about finances or wealth
81:56
like a lot not like wow someone gave me
82:00
a hundred dollars like a lot we've had
82:04
quite a few sudden ease ourselves so I'm
82:06
asking God to give you some of those
82:08
also amen
82:10
so when I when I heart fire to you I'm
82:15
gonna add suddenly okay say I want the
82:20
Sun lease say I expect them I'm getting
82:25
ready for them I'm serious I really
82:29
wanted God I'm a suddenly son or
82:33
daughter so send it there you go now you
82:39
set yourself up so I just want to get
82:43
ready to lay hands on people it doesn't
82:48
matter how old you are you can have a
82:49
suddenly and you can also have the fiery
82:51
men I see some kids running around
82:56
they're gonna be fierce I'm talking
82:59
about children yeah I have several
83:05
grandchildren that already are fierce so
83:10
I expect them to be fierce amen say
83:13
fierce
83:15
is a good word in this more time of God
83:20
it's passionate remember the word says
83:25
we take it by force so don't do don't be
83:32
mediocre don't be lukewarm you have to
83:38
take it by force amen
83:41
in the time of John the Baptist until
83:43
now the Kingdom of Heaven stirs up and
83:47
encourages for us to be fierce amen and
83:54
dangerous and violent
83:58
say violence in the spirit realm is a
84:04
good thing when we have it that word
84:10
suffers does not mean that heavens being
84:12
beat up by somebody however back to the
84:15
translations God said go read some of
84:20
the translations and see how they have
84:21
translated or interpreted that verse
84:24
from the time of John the Baptist until
84:26
now the Kingdom of Heaven suffers
84:28
violence and the violent take up by
84:30
force and it literally said people are
84:32
running into heaven and stealing things
84:34
I don't know where they got that heaven
84:38
is under attack no I don't believe that
84:42
for a second it's us who are supposed to
84:47
be violently passionate against the
84:51
enemy and we had the right to take back
84:54
whatever he has taken from us because he
84:57
had no right to it Amen I love giving
85:02
revelation in the word - it actually
85:04
makes sense amen training up your child
85:09
and the gift God put in them whether
85:12
it's a drummer or a baker or an interior
85:14
designer in the never depart from that
85:19
gift because they'll be doing the thing
85:22
they love the most that word in there
85:26
says train up a child in the Ben
85:28
or the way he made them that means who
85:34
he sent you as what gift he made you and
85:36
sent you here every good and perfect
85:38
gift comes down from the Father of
85:40
lights and God said everybody sits on
85:42
the few of the chair every Sunday trying
85:45
to figure out what their spiritual gift
85:47
is but one of the most important gifts
85:52
he gave you is your natural gift your
85:54
passion what you love what he made you
85:57
to be or do in this earth that's not
86:00
your job it's the thing you're the most
86:03
passionate about you know your child is
86:05
a drummer if they beat everything
86:07
everything they have they beat on the
86:08
table with it you know straw spoons
86:11
forks whatever it is you buy them a farm
86:15
you know the farm is set for Christmas
86:17
and they pick them up and start beating
86:18
on something with them the cow and the
86:20
horse here they go take them in a
86:22
restaurant they use the straws take them
86:24
outside so they'll be quiet and then
86:26
they break branches off the bush and
86:27
start drumming with the bush say I think
86:31
they're a drummer so raise them up as a
86:35
drummer and they'll never run around the
86:38
world trying to figure out who they are
86:39
does that scripture make sense it's a
86:43
revelation that's how important your
86:46
natural gift is because when you go to
86:49
heaven he plans to use it it's
86:55
irrevocable you meant to be a baker make
86:58
the best brownies or whatever it is you
87:00
make everybody in the neighborhood loves
87:02
them that everybody tells you to sell
87:03
them when you go home to heaven you're
87:05
going to make that and everybody will
87:07
have it for free and everybody will love
87:10
you they have rodeos amusement parks
87:13
because people have gifts that do that
87:16
is that right that's why we have fun in
87:19
heaven and it's so natural they walk in
87:23
heaven and here's all the stuff they
87:25
need to design and to put together
87:26
something that won't take forever to
87:29
make it you're gonna be a baker as part
87:31
of your mansion you have a full out
87:33
kitchen with supernatural devices to use
87:36
and all the supplies you need and then
87:39
out in the front you have a bakery where
87:41
everybody comes body
87:42
your stuff Jesus will visit you
87:45
regularly he has a sweet tooth that's
87:51
why he liked honeycomb remember we
87:54
served on the beach to his disciples
87:56
remember he served him a meal he gave
87:58
them what fish and say honey when it is
88:05
cousin eat locusts and it ran in the
88:10
family say I'm in the family now I know
88:15
why I have a sweet tooth amen
88:20
okay we're going to we're going to do
88:22

88:25

88:30
