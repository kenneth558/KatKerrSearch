00:00
thought i would talk a little bit and
00:01
then maybe jen could come up with some
00:03
questions because you know we get them
00:04
all the time
00:06
either about heaven or something else
00:08
but um yeah i'm so filled with god right
00:10
now after doing that interview it was
00:12
very powerful
00:13
and so i thought i'd talk some more
00:15
about the restart of america which is
00:17
still continuing
00:18
and i know some places is a little bit
00:20
slower than others
00:21
uh we're having really a great response
00:24
from our governor
00:25
here in florida so we're really excited
00:27
about that we're praying for others who
00:29
aren't really maybe getting the same
00:31
response from theirs
00:33
just remember on election day who you
00:34
vote for next time
00:36
and i just want to encourage you that
00:38
that we're hearing more and more things
00:41
are being reopened
00:42
and then the reopening is being expanded
00:45
to
00:46
like more people able to attend and
00:47
stuff like that i don't think they're
00:49
quite ready to do mass
00:51
crowds meeting together for big events
00:53
and stuff like that so i'm sure a lot of
00:54
people are being affected by that
00:57
i'm sure that that was not easy for any
00:59
of them
01:00
and i know many people try different
01:02
things like drive-by church
01:04
you know online church was amazing
01:07
yay dede and david in colorado at um
01:11
up on lookout mountain they did a great
01:12
job i think they broadcasted every
01:15
single night
01:16
since the quarantine happened they're
01:18
still doing it and they're still
01:19
doing it and that would be um gateway on
01:22
mount zion gateway on mount zion
01:25
online you can go yeah their facebook
01:28
page or their website
01:29
their website in uh yeah gateway on
01:32
mount zion in
01:33
golden colorado they're really powerful
01:36
and i know there were many others who do
01:37
that i just happen to know
01:39
that they are one of them and let me
01:41
tell you god is going to be
01:43
really be visiting places it was a
01:46
wonderful thing
01:47
the day the holy spirit invaded our
01:49
earth
01:50
and let me tell you he is my best friend
01:52
make sure you know him well
01:54
he will share things with you to come
01:56
he'll give revelation on the word of god
01:58
he'll tweak your life all day long and
02:01
jen and i both know he does that with us
02:04
he'll even go shopping with you and tell
02:06
you the best deals to get and
02:08
honestly i'll even go to get something
02:09
like i want to pick apples out
02:11
he'll actually tell me don't get those
02:12
get these other ones are going to taste
02:14
better
02:14
it depends on how much you open yourself
02:16
up to him you know he's the third member
02:18
of
02:19
passing that's what god's been saying is
02:20
just going to pass on
02:22
and there will be no second wave he has
02:25
assured me of that many times so i hope
02:27
that encourages some people
02:29
and i know in other countries people
02:31
really also been praying to god for many
02:33
things
02:33
that they need help with and we pray for
02:36
people
02:37
all the time to be touched by god to be
02:39
ministered for resources to come
02:41
for help to come to different people and
02:43
you know i know to some people it looks
02:45
like utterly impossible don't say it's
02:47
impossible
02:48
you need to stay with god all things are
02:51
possible and begin to thank him for the
02:52
things you need
02:54
if you've been praying and asking him
02:55
that's fine but start thanking him for
02:57
these things
02:58
it says call those things that be not as
03:01
though they were
03:03
that means you talk about them like
03:05
they're already here
03:06
that's called faith so i want to
03:09
encourage everybody
03:10
i hope your faith has been increased
03:12
during this time
03:13
and i know this is something probably
03:15
most people will never forget
03:17
of course there'll be generations coming
03:18
behind us that don't know anything about
03:20
that
03:21
but i think this has been a very
03:23
different time
03:24
and and hopefully the best part of you
03:27
has come out during this time
03:29
don't forget to pray and reach out to
03:31
others there are many people
03:33
who we may have less of things but let
03:35
me tell you there's some that have
03:36
nothing
03:38
and my dad's heart was always to help
03:40
those kind of people we spent years and
03:42
years
03:42
helping people feeding them finding them
03:44
clothes finding them jobs
03:46
finding houses for them that was just
03:50
put in me
03:50
and so that's my heart is to be help
03:53
people
03:53
be generous you know and sometimes be
03:56
generous even when you need something
03:57
yourself
03:58
that touches the heart of god when you
04:00
give out of your own need
04:02
it really does touch god's heart and i
04:04
know that right now he's got great
04:06
things prepared for all of us
04:07
i just finished saying that in our
04:10
interview with steve schultz of elijah's
04:12
i'm going to encourage everyone out
04:14
there if you are not signed up
04:16
to elijah list.com you need to go
04:20
do that because he has the proven
04:24
prophets you'll hear words from prophets
04:26
some you know some you don't know
04:28
and then you can watch and see what god
04:30
does once they have spoken and declare
04:32
things
04:34
he's had me on there several times just
04:36
discussing things prophesying things god
04:38
has said
04:39
and he won't let people come on there if
04:41
all they want to do is bash and bring
04:43
doom and gloom and death and destruction
04:45
this is not the time for that to happen
04:47
in this earth
04:48
these are the greater days of god and so
04:51
i really want to encourage you
04:53
keep declaring that the restart
04:55
operation restart will be fully taking
04:57
place
04:58
and that people will be able to go back
05:00
to somewhat of a normal life i hope it's
05:02
not going to be normal as far as god is
05:04
concerned i hope you've increased your
05:06
relationship with your family
05:08
and with him and then get ready for some
05:10
awesome things to begin to happen
05:13
for all of us and that we also pray for
05:16
people in other countries god i thank
05:18
you
05:18
for helping to bring supply to those
05:21
countries that don't have supply
05:24
we speak against and take authority over
05:26
any of the virus right now we won't
05:27
tolerate the virus even anywhere on the
05:29
earth in jesus name
05:31
we are over sickness and disease we are
05:33
not under it
05:34
christ was never upset he was never
05:38
controlled by any form of sickness or
05:39
disease when he walked down this earth
05:41
and you shouldn't either he didn't have
05:44
to put up with lack
05:45
okay with violence he didn't have to put
05:48
up with um
05:50
any forms of oppression or depression he
05:53
didn't keep
05:53
in him and he didn't participate with it
05:56
and make sure you're saying that
05:58
yourself
05:58
there's people out there right now if
06:00
you're oppressed don't tolerate it
06:02
loose it out of your soul get rid of it
06:04
don't let it control you don't let fear
06:06
control you
06:08
because this is not going to drag on for
06:10
years and years and why am i saying that
06:12
because i was in the grocery store the
06:14
other day and the person just
06:15
you know just ringing up my my supplies
06:19
they were saying that their self oh i
06:20
just think this is going to last for
06:22
years what are we going to do we don't
06:23
have any kind of a life and i said well
06:25
that is not correct this is for a very
06:28
short time
06:29
it's going to pass and then your life
06:31
will begin to
06:32
increase again so anywhere i can give
06:36
hope or encouragement to people i'm
06:37
going to do that
06:39
that's what we're supposed to do and so
06:42
thank you for all your prayers and all
06:43
you guardians i want to thank you so
06:45
much for your support
06:47
you have blessed our hearts you've
06:48
blessed the heart of god
06:50
every chance i get i'm going to make
06:52
sure i thank them
06:53
and we have so many more things coming
06:57

06:59
more programs coming up right now that
07:01

07:02

because we have some extra time in the
07:07
the studio is all set up
07:08
we're gonna we're gonna go ahead and
07:10
answer some questions i think jen has
07:12
some questions that she can ask me
07:16
we've been trying to figure out why the
07:18
internet was sticking so
07:20
and i do know you know that we've had
07:22
some issues here techno
07:23
you know with some of the technical
07:25
stuff here that i don't understand
07:26
yeah i don't understand that at all i
07:29
just know that i know how to talk and so
07:31
that's
07:31
my part and we do take authority over
07:34
and we're not towering the enemy getting
07:36
in any of our systems
07:37
frequencies technology whatever it is
07:39
we're kicking him out in jesus name
07:41
because i know people are probably out
07:42
there praying now i'm in agreement
07:44
with every one of you and so we want to
07:46
have a great broadcast and a signal to
07:48
be strong in jesus name
07:50
so what do you have today jen for a
07:52
question well i just asked everybody on
07:54
facebook can i play the intro oh yeah oh
07:58
we're gonna we're gonna do a short
07:59
q a so we're gonna let you see our
08:01
little intro
08:03
we're gonna
08:24
so
08:33
okay we're ready for our q a but
08:36
before we start i already have a
08:38
question that i was asked the other day
08:41
and jen just reminded me
08:43
people are asking about our 2020
08:46
calendar
08:47
i know the year is almost half over but
08:49
this isn't just about the months or the
08:51
days of the months
08:53
this is about revealing heaven and these
08:56
calendars we create are what god wants
08:58
he wants to reveal heaven to the earth
09:00
the spirit realm to the earth
09:02
the host of heaven the army of heaven
09:03
whatever it is he once revealed that's
09:06
part of our job
09:07
to reveal heaven to earth and so they
09:10
want to know about our calendar because
09:12
we've been talking about it lately
09:14
there's some fun activities in there
09:15
that you can do with us that interact
09:17
with us
09:18
and one happens to be this month that's
09:20
how this whole thing started this is the
09:22
calendar right here
09:24
i hope you can see it it's called the
09:27
world called heaven
09:29
and on the cover is an actual picture
09:33
of a place that exists in heaven
09:36
we all know about hebrews 12 1
09:39
that talks about the great cloud of
09:41
witnesses that are watching this from
09:43
heaven
09:44
this is one of the places they do that
09:46
this is called
09:48
the portal and they have them all over
09:50
heaven people come in
09:52
way here this is the doorway walk down
09:54
here they walk up steps
09:56
these are steps that go up here to this
09:58
opening you can see the opening right
09:59
there
10:00
and that's where people look down in
10:02
they can view the earth declare over the
10:04
loved ones
10:05
see things happening good things
10:06
happening on the earth
10:08
and they sing they go and sing to you on
10:10
your birthday
10:11
they they understand they get to see
10:14
weddings and babies being born and all
10:16
kinds of things like that
10:17
so this is a beautiful place that's
10:19
mentioned in the bible
10:21
i was taken to that place and so this
10:23
entire calendar
10:25
actually that's what this is about and
10:27
every month you see a place or a being
10:30
that is in heaven
10:31
and i'll show you one more and uh
10:34
but we have special days we put in here
10:37
we put some of our own days in here
10:39
what is not in here is satan's holiday
10:42
you won't see that okay we're not giving
10:43
him any place whatsoever
10:45
uh and so let me find one of the other
10:48
places there's so many i want to show
10:50
you
10:50
this is just awesome and most of these
10:53
places were places i personally was
10:55
taken to in heaven
10:57
here's one of somebody going home to
10:59
heaven
11:00
this is called the transport and this
11:04
woman
11:04
who you can see standing there with the
11:06
red hair she was 90 in her 90s
11:09
when she passed and when she stepped her
11:11
spiritual body stepped out of her body
11:13
this is what she
11:14
looked like young and happy she's very
11:17
happy
11:17
those are her two guardian angels about
11:19
to take her home to heaven
11:22
and then over here you'll find an
11:24
explanation at the bottom of the picture
11:26
over here you'll find an explanation
11:28
of what this picture is about so you you
11:30
get understanding not just
11:32
images and then like i said and at the
11:35
bottom of every month
11:37
we have a declaration that we make
11:40
like here this one says heaven
11:41
celebrates each time a believer comes
11:43
home
11:44
so you get this at the end of each
11:46
calendar month
11:47
we make a declaration like that for you
11:49
so it's very exciting you will see
11:51
places in heaven you never even dreamed
11:54
were there
11:55
we do still have some left but the
11:57
reason people want them
11:59
is because we have interactive days like
12:01
we have a day we said
12:02
uh tell people you know show us with you
12:05
wearing angel wings
12:07
and that was one of the days and but you
12:10
have to use the
12:11
email email address that is on the
12:14
calendar
12:15
for those interactive things we do still
12:17
have some left
12:18
so maybe for the next month or so we'll
12:21
have some
12:22
so you can find them on
12:24
revealingheaven.com
12:25
go to our website click on the store and
12:28
you'll see this calendar
12:30
there uh we are already in the in the
12:33
we are already right now creating to the
12:35
2021 calendar
12:37
and the one before this one which was
12:39
2019
12:40
was about the host of heaven we we
12:43
revealed
12:44
and introduced heaven's army
12:47
into the earth because the father had
12:49
asked us to do that
12:50
and so there's many other things in here
12:53
i'll show you one more this is called
12:55
the hall of knowledge
12:57
i'm not the only one who's been there
12:59
there's these beautiful towers made out
13:01
of emerald like they look like emerald
13:03
glass
13:04
you ride on roads of light through these
13:07
towers and that you can learn all kinds
13:10
of different things
13:11
the books actually show you the book
13:14
you would take the book out of the niche
13:16
and you lay it on this little table and
13:18
it opens up and shows you like a movie
13:20
of what's in the book
13:21
this is heaven this is not the earth so
13:25
if you're interested make sure you go to
13:27
revealingheaven.com you can ask for
13:30
on the web store on the web store and
13:32
then you can find the world called
13:34
heaven calendar
13:34
and they need to click on the correct
13:36
link that pertains to
13:38
where they live there's a link for
13:41
canada there's a link for the us and
13:44
then there's a link for all other
13:45
countries
13:47
because you know we ship internationally
13:49
around the world and they have different
13:51
costs for different um for shipping
13:54
and so that's why it's important you
13:56
click on the right one so your calendar
13:58
is not sent to the wrong country
14:00
and so there you go there's a little bit
14:02
of information from a question that we
14:04
got so what do you have next jen
14:06
um i have a question from eagle
14:09
eagle and um
14:13
they asked can our loved ones visit us
14:16
in our dreams how can our loved ones
14:20
visit us in our dreams the loved ones
14:22
from heaven eyes and right
14:23
yes that happens to many people
14:27
people have very vivid dreams and
14:30
i would have to say absolutely that does
14:32
happen
14:34
god speaks to people and visions and
14:37
dreams it says so in the bible
14:39
so that is possible for you to have a
14:42
dream
14:43
or even a vision of your loved one in
14:45
heaven
14:47
and actually some people have been
14:48
caught up to heaven while they were
14:50
sleeping and didn't realize that
14:52
and they have very vivid dreams of being
14:54
in heaven with their loved ones so
14:56
you know with god those things are
14:58
possible but absolutely
15:00
that is possible for that to happen and
15:02
sometimes it will happen like right
15:04
after somebody passes away
15:06
um i've heard of some people just
15:08
appearing briefly
15:10
in the room and waving sometimes they
15:12
don't say anything sometimes they just
15:14
say
15:14
i want you know i'm okay or i love you
15:17
and
15:18
i think that depends on getting
15:20
permission from the father
15:21
for them to get permission from the
15:22
father to do that i know people are so
15:25
undone
15:26
and overwhelmed when they first get to
15:27
heaven their whole head and heart is
15:29
just trying to take
15:31
in that glorious place of splendor
15:34
in heaven and of course the
15:36
relationships they have with people they
15:38
are
15:38
meeting the father and the son and holy
15:41
spirit just seeing the beauty that's
15:43
there
15:43
the things you prepare for them their
15:45
own mansion
15:46
they're just getting undone it's like
15:48
one gift every time they go somewhere
15:50
else it's something beautiful
15:52
but yes i do believe it's possible to
15:54
have dreams and visions
15:55
okay um i found this question
15:59
almost quite well not really humorous so
16:01
it's it's a good one
16:03
it's from dawn and she said cat do
16:05
angels ever
16:06
mess up like when someone gets in an
16:09
accident or something
16:11
is that them maybe not paying attention
16:14
or slacking off on their job
16:15
lol just always wondered about that
16:18
i don't think it's about an angel if an
16:21
angel messed up
16:22
it wouldn't be something to do with
16:23
rescuing somebody
16:25
or protecting somebody i think
16:28
so many different circumstances issues
16:31
in our own lives
16:32
you know the enemy will try to attack
16:35
anywhere that he
16:36
can make sure you're declaring and
16:38
decreeing against that happening make
16:40
sure that you're
16:40
involving the army of heaven in your
16:43
life um
16:44
make sure there's all kinds of things so
16:46
i have to say for sure
16:48
angels don't mess up on something that
16:50
would be that important
16:51
they probably you know you have to
16:53
realize these are real these beings have
16:55
real personalities like you and i
16:57
they all have souls they all have
16:59
emotions
17:00
and so i think sometimes maybe they're
17:03
not quite getting along
17:04
especially on an assignment i think they
17:06
would get maybe a harder assignment
17:08
given to them
17:10
i do know sometimes that does happen i
17:12
don't know how often but
17:13
like i said some people have stronger
17:16
personalities some
17:18
have really fun personalities i know
17:20
that there's some angels that are almost
17:22
like comedians and there's
17:23
others who are very focused and fierce
17:25
against the enemy
17:27
and that whatever their personality is
17:29
that that's definitely going to come out
17:30
in their assignments that god gives them
17:32
of course they're answerable to him the
17:34
thing about being an angel is
17:36
nothing is hidden god definitely knows
17:39
everything that's going on with them and
17:40
they live with him
17:41
so i think he has to handle that stuff
17:45
and i know um we always have new people
17:47
that come in
17:48
or people that haven't heard you talk
17:50
about stuff and people who've heard you
17:52
say
17:52
this stuff a million times but it's like
17:56
certain people need to hear it and i
17:58
really feel like
17:59
um i want to ask this question this is
18:02
from pam
18:03
and she said you may have addressed this
18:05
already please forgive me if it's a
18:07
redundant
18:08
i am a nurse you've mentioned we
18:11
will do the same work in heaven
18:14
there isn't any sickness or lack in
18:17
heaven
18:18
we all that um i know
18:21
i've done on earth uh
18:24
let's see what will i do for papa god if
18:27
my job
18:28
won't be needed well it's not your job
18:32
it's not your job that you do in heaven
18:34
nobody has a job it says actually says
18:36
you labor no more
18:38
what you do for a living is not what
18:41
you'll be doing in heaven
18:42
unless you've been using the gift he put
18:44
in you let's say someone who's a
18:46
recording artist and they're singing and
18:48
they're so anointed
18:49
they will be doing that in heaven but
18:51
they'll be doing it for everybody in
18:53
heaven for free
18:55
so it's probably your hobby or something
18:58
that is your passion
18:59
uh maybe even though you were a nurse
19:01
and you took care of people of course
19:03
there is absolutely no sickness in
19:04
heaven whatsoever
19:06
they don't need lawyers doctors nurses
19:08
there's all kinds of things they just
19:10
don't need them in heaven because that
19:11
stuff doesn't exist there
19:12
but somewhere in you he put a natural
19:15
gift
19:17
not a job okay those are skills i'm not
19:20
talking even about skills skills can be
19:23
learned but a gift is something he puts
19:25
in you and that's the thing you love to
19:27
do the most that's how you can tell what
19:29
it is
19:30
it says every good and perfect gift
19:33
comes down from the father of lights
19:36
that would be you
19:37
and when he made you in your little
19:39
spirit man
19:40
he placed in that spirit man a gift
19:44
whether it is an artist whether it is a
19:46
dancer whether you're going to sing
19:48
whether you're going to grow the best
19:49
flowers ever
19:51
whether you're gonna make the best i
19:52
don't know chimichangas
19:54
uh donuts whatever it is the culinary
19:57
arts
19:57
are absolutely i don't know where that
19:59
came from somebody probably likes them
20:01
i don't like them whatever whatever okay
20:05
baker's bakers are loved in heaven
20:08
because let me tell you
20:09
he gives you your own shop everything
20:11
you make it all make all the wonderful
20:13
stuff there's no gluten free
20:15
no weight gain i can just go on and on
20:17
yeah none of this stuff
20:18
you don't have to have keto you don't
20:21
have to eat keto
20:22
stuff at the same time and so they're
20:24
let me tell you there's fried chicken
20:25
there's pizza i've been to a pizza
20:27
parlor and haven't
20:28
had ice cream cones and everyone that's
20:30
their gift because that was their
20:32
passion on the earth and they knew that
20:35
it says your gifts and your callings are
20:38
without repentance and he will not
20:40
take irrevocable means he'll never take
20:42
it away that means if he put in you to
20:44
be an
20:45
artist yes and maybe you never actually
20:47
had a gallery or anything like that but
20:49
maybe all you want to do is sketch
20:51
you're a great sketch artist maybe you
20:53
you understand colors and stuff like
20:55
that
20:56
maybe you want to make pottery with your
20:57
hands but you don't do that for a living
20:59
but it's your
20:59
passion that's your gift it's what your
21:02
passion is maybe it was a drummer
21:06
and one grandson he started drumming on
21:07
everything before he was a year old we
21:09
knew he was going to be a drummer guess
21:11
what he still loves it
21:12
that's his gift when he goes to heaven
21:14
one day he'll be a drummer
21:16
that's not a job you don't have to labor
21:19
it's not something that you don't like
21:21
it's not something that's hard it's like
21:24
breathing you
21:25
love it so much so guess what and all
21:27
that i do
21:28
and all that jen does we are
21:30
photographers
21:32
my gift is i'm not going to be a
21:34
revelator in heaven okay i'm not going
21:35
to be a prophet in heaven
21:37
i'm not going to be those things i'm not
21:39
going to be any minister i'm not going
21:40
to do that i will be a photographer why
21:43
because i love it it is my passion from
21:46
the time i was little i'd make fake
21:48
little cameras with a box
21:49
and pretend i was taking pictures until
21:51
i got my first camera
21:53
and i have never stopped loving it i
21:55
already know in heaven i'll have a
21:57
studio come by and see me one day when
21:59
you get there
22:00
i'll take your pictures for free and
22:02
create beautiful stuff out of that
22:04
so that's what you'll do whatever your
22:07
hobby is
22:08
whatever your passion is it's in there
22:11
somewhere that's what you will be and
22:13
all your property will be designed
22:15
that's why there's amusement parks
22:17
there's rodeos there's all kinds of
22:19
wonderful fun things there
22:21
and every time someone comes home to
22:23
heaven there's something new and
22:25
exciting
22:26
to do but they're not working they're
22:28
not laboring
22:29
it is the most fun they've ever had in
22:32
their life so there that's a good answer
22:34
for those people
22:35
who don't know they keep sitting on the
22:36
pew their church this is what god says
22:39
all my people keep sitting on the pew of
22:40
their church trying to figure out what
22:41
their spiritual gift is and yet the
22:43
thing i want them to know the most
22:45
is what is their natural gift that i
22:48
made them
22:49
when i sent them to the earth because
22:51
when you get home to heaven
22:52
that'll be the most exciting thing you
22:54
do there yep
22:55
okay one more what's one more okay um
23:01
i've been screen shotting questions okay
23:04
um
23:05
back to uh the when you were talking
23:08
about the angels
23:09
um this one person didn't quite
23:11
understand her
23:12
her name is i want to say remy
23:16
home um she said how could they not get
23:19
along
23:20
there is no evil in the angels so i
23:23
guess she does she thinks they fight
23:25
no no no i'm not talking about fighting
23:27
like evil there is no evil there is no
23:29
hate
23:30
they don't do that in heaven but they
23:32
have personalities everybody has a
23:35
personality
23:36
okay and you have to understand angels
23:38
are spiritual beings
23:40
we're physical beings okay we both have
23:43
a soul
23:44
but we have to make our we all get to
23:46
make our own decisions
23:48
because you're a believer and you're
23:50
going to heaven doesn't mean you
23:51
always you don't ever have disagreements
23:54
with people
23:55
okay there is no anger no coveting
23:58
there's no jealousy in heaven
24:00
there's no wrath nobody fights nobody
24:03
hits somebody nobody does things
24:04
spiteful i'm not talking about that kind
24:06
of stuff
24:07
i forget sometimes to relate things my
24:10
answers to
24:11
heaven culture and not earth culture so
24:15
your mind is thinking
24:16
earth culture earth atmosphere earth
24:20
living
24:20
it's not like that in heaven but not
24:23
everybody wants the same thing even in
24:25
heaven but they still agree
24:27
to enjoy their self to have fun you
24:30
still have your favorite things your
24:31
favorite colors in heaven
24:33
that god doesn't take all that away from
24:34
you but there is no anger no wrath no
24:37
hating no spitefulness no coveting
24:39
there's no offense that part
24:43
that part of your your flesh emotions
24:46
because right now we're spirit man but
24:48
we still have our flesh when he talks
24:50
about your flesh lay down your flesh
24:52
right
24:53
that's not talking about you dying as a
24:56
person that's talking about your
24:57
opinions your rights your attitudes
25:00
your anger issues that's the flesh
25:03
that stuff is not there but people still
25:06
have their personalities their likes or
25:08
dislikes
25:09
and sometimes when angels are sent on
25:11
assignment god on purpose and this is
25:13
why he does it there's no marriage
25:15
between the angels they don't get
25:17
married on this earth we get married and
25:19
one of the things that he does with
25:20
marriages
25:21
sharpens the husband and wife that
25:23
doesn't mean
25:24
get you angry enough that you divorce
25:26
but it stretches us
25:28
right it makes us to come into agreement
25:30
on different things sometimes you know
25:32
we have to give a little
25:33
take to get you know we have to come
25:36
together in agreement
25:38
even as husband and wife but it
25:39
stretches it says
25:41
steal sharpen steel that's what happens
25:43
when you're married you sharpen each
25:45
other
25:46
you make each other care more understand
25:48
things aren't going to be perfect but
25:49
you're
25:50
you're willing to work it out in heaven
25:52
they don't have that so god has another
25:54
way that the angels get
25:56
stretched right and he sends different
25:59
personalities on assignment and i happen
26:02
to know this is true because two that
26:03
were assigned to me for a while
26:05
one was a comedian the other one was so
26:07
fierce
26:08
against darkness he wanted to talk about
26:10
being holy he wanted to talk about
26:12
crushing the enemy
26:13
that would be satan his plans the other
26:15
one wanted to make jokes because he was
26:17
funny
26:18
his personality was totally opposite of
26:20
the southern angels they
26:21
stretched each other every time they
26:24
were
26:24
with me they didn't get angry each other
26:27
so forget about the anger thing that's
26:29
earth thinking but angels have
26:32
personalities in heaven
26:33
and they like many different things and
26:36
they have friends amongst each other no
26:38
romance
26:39
okay they don't happen in heaven um the
26:41
angels who fell
26:42
tried that it didn't work so that's what
26:45
i'm talking about when i said you know
26:46
it's not like
26:47
your flesh getting involved i'm talking
26:49
about on the earth
26:50
when you loosen stuff from your soul get
26:53
grace for that day
26:54
and you work through your things you
26:56
don't get offended
26:58
you don't get in wrath um because
27:01
we have help from heaven okay one more
27:04
next question angel question and then i
27:06
have a question i have a 13 year old
27:08
um wow melissa wants to know
27:12
do we have the same guardian angel our
27:14
whole life
27:16
yes you have the same guardian angel
27:18
your entire life at the time you are
27:20
conceived
27:22
when life begins life doesn't begin when
27:24
a baby's born
27:26
life begins the time of conception and
27:29
from that moment your angel your
27:31
guardian angel or angels are sent from
27:33
heaven
27:34
they are will you your entire life
27:37
they are the ones who help bring you
27:40
home to heaven
27:41
when your body dies and your spiritual
27:43
body steps
27:44
out the first one you will see normally
27:47
will be your guardian angels and they
27:48
escort you home in a transport
27:51
all different ways you can be taken
27:52
chariots you can be taken to heaven
27:54
they will be with you the whole time
27:57
awesome okay
27:58
um charity's 13 year old daughter
28:01
her name is i want to say lyanna
28:06
but she would like to know can we ever
28:08
get kicked out of heaven
28:10
no but he's going to get kicked out of
28:12
heaven that only happened once and that
28:14
would be satan and all the angels
28:16
who fell with him they were the only
28:18
ones who'd been kicked out of heaven all
28:19
right they decided to go against god to
28:21
try to take over heaven
28:23
that was a long time ago and so he was
28:27
one third of all the angels in heaven
28:30
how about that that's crazy
28:31
chose satan chose lucifer
28:35
as their new leader and they all got
28:37
kicked out but
28:38
no one who goes there you're not going
28:40
to get kicked out of heaven okay
28:43
when you step out of your physical body
28:46
with your spiritual body
28:47
you already whatever things whatever
28:50
issues you had
28:52
whether it was anger against somebody or
28:54
you had
28:55
issues maybe you didn't even like
28:56
yourself all
28:58
that is gone okay those things you don't
29:01
carry up to heaven
29:03
the people you cared about the gifts he
29:06
put in you to use
29:07
that stuff remains with you and
29:09
excitement adventure
29:11
and all kinds of wonderful things are in
29:13
heaven but
29:14
you can't get kicked out of heaven
29:16
because when you receive jesus christ as
29:18
your savior
29:19
all the stuff all the sins in you get
29:21
wiped away
29:22
like they never happen don't let the
29:25
enemy remind you of your sins if you
29:28
repented of them all right
29:29
now even god can remember them because
29:31
you told him that you were sorry for
29:33
them
29:34
and so i can assure you that no one's
29:36
going to get kicked out of heaven
29:39
okay and um this is another one you've
29:41
answered before but i love to hear you
29:42
talk about this
29:44
um erica's brother she didn't say what
29:46
his name was but
29:48
he wants to know if there is hunting
29:51
in heaven this is a fun answer actually
29:56
that's why i asked it i think you know
29:58
jen knows a lot because she's heard
30:00
so many probably she's probably heard
30:02
every single time i went to heaven
30:04
and for those of you who don't know me
30:06
yes god has never stopped catching me up
30:07
to heaven yes he can do that because he
30:09
wants to no i don't choose to go myself
30:11
this is all free for all of you so you
30:13
understand
30:14
god caught people up to heaven in the
30:16
old testament
30:18
it says so he caught people up to heaven
30:20
in the new testament
30:22
without dying and he still does that
30:25
because he chooses to
30:26
and so she knows just about every time
30:28
he caught me up not in this physical
30:30
body it would stay behind you catch me
30:32
my spirit man my spiritual body that
30:34
looked just like me
30:36
but a lot better and so what was the
30:38
question
30:40
erica's brother now if there's hunting
30:44
in heaven
30:44
is there hunting in heaven you'd be
30:46
surprised what god has
30:48
uh has in heaven but it's the way he
30:51
does it this different
30:53
okay almost everything we have on the
30:54
earth is in heaven
30:56
except there's no killing no no harm
30:59
nobody gets injured uh none of that
31:02
happens in heaven okay
31:04
so um
31:09
i'm getting distracted today
31:13
is there like are you seeing angels
31:16
well there are angels all over in here
31:17
right now okay of course i could get
31:19
distracted just by the one that's behind
31:21
me and the one who's
31:22
two on here the one standing by you the
31:24
one standing by chris okay the one's
31:26
sticking their heads with the ceiling
31:28
looking down
31:29
and the ones looking through i'm gonna
31:30
figure
31:35
oh yes because you know i don't really
31:37
want to hunt
31:39
maybe well no we won't say that i don't
31:42
hunt i don't want to hurt anything
31:44
maybe mosquitoes there's hunting in
31:46
heaven
31:47
but this is the way god does it because
31:49
nothing gets killed remember what i said
31:52
no creatures are killed all animals are
31:55
called creatures in heaven
31:56
they all talk they all have actually uh
32:00
amazing personalities but you do go to
32:04
the mountain of spices that actually
32:06
exist in heaven
32:07
and what you do is a camera shoot
32:11
you're capturing the image and they
32:14
actually have a clubhouse in this whole
32:16
place
32:17
and you will be hunted by the creatures
32:21
with their own cameras while you're
32:22
hunting
32:23
them and your goal when you get to
32:26
heaven is to be the first one to get
32:28
their picture which is sent back to this
32:30
huge clubhouse with like a 40-50 foot
32:33
screen
32:34
and down in the corner is the one who
32:35
captured you and on the screen is the
32:37
one that was captured
32:39
and so all these people i actually saw
32:42
people in heaven doing that
32:43
they had you know pack horses and they
32:45
were packing all their camera equipment
32:47
on these horses
32:49
they even have different type cameras
32:52
that look like sort of like a scope
32:54
thing and when you
32:56
some of these creatures are not anywhere
32:57
on the earth by the way so you're really
32:59
hunting something that's fantastic
33:01
but more times than not
33:04
when you get back to the clubhouse you
33:06
will see your face plastered all over
33:08
the big screen
33:10
and in the corner will be the creature
33:11
who captured you
33:13
by getting that picture first so it's
33:16
very intense because while you're
33:18
hunting to find the creatures to get
33:20
their pictures
33:21
it's a camera shoot remember you're not
33:23
gonna hurt anything but
33:25
how intense is that
33:28
hunting process when you're looking for
33:31
something that's never been seen before
33:33
and yet they're probably smarter than
33:35
you they hide to you
33:37
and they get you first when you go back
33:40
thinking wow i know i snapped that
33:41
picture
33:42
and you walk in the clubhouse and
33:43
there's your face plastered all over
33:46
you know that you were busted and you
33:48
were caught
33:49
not them but the intensity and
33:51
excitement even increases more so in
33:54
heaven
33:54
but nobody gets hurt or harmed and no
33:57
life is taken
33:58
so you will still get to do that
34:01
try your best if you can when you get
34:03
there
34:04
okay i have a um another question you've
34:07
talked about before
34:08
but um holy spirit really wants me to
34:10
ask this so
34:11
um do aborted babies and babies in
34:14
general
34:15
have their own mansions especially when
34:18
they grow up
34:19
or if not where do they live
34:22
i brought this everybody everyone
34:25
no matter who they are will eventually
34:28
have their own mansion
34:30
jesus said in my father's house that's a
34:33
world by the way just you understand
34:35
god's house is the world called heaven
34:37
bigger than our
34:38
galaxy and uh trust me there's plenty of
34:42
room for mansions
34:44
and when little babies go home to having
34:46
every baby
34:48
who dies passes leaves this earth with
34:51
however you want to say it whether
34:53
through abortion
34:53
miscarriage or because they were sick or
34:56
whatever if when they die
34:58
and they go home to heaven they will
35:00
know family members in heaven
35:02
uh they will grow very slowly uh we've
35:06
actually
35:06
know of people who when they were 40
35:09
years old died on the operating table
35:11
saw their seven-year-old son playing in
35:13
the streets of gold who died years
35:14
before that
35:16
but because they the the mother went in
35:18
her spiritual body
35:19
her son recognized him he still looked
35:22
seven years old
35:23
he was playing with friends on the
35:24
streets of gold and he recognized her
35:27
and actually told her you can't stay you
35:29
have to go back but god allowed her to
35:31
see her son
35:33
number one he was well and whole he was
35:35
happy
35:36
he was playing he had friends and his
35:39
mom
35:40
came back of course she survived her
35:42
operation
35:43
and for years her and her husband would
35:45
travel around the world and tell people
35:47
about the beauty and the love of god
35:49
that their child was still waiting on
35:51
them in heaven
35:52
now she's already home in heaven so when
35:54
the parent comes home
35:56
to the baby they actually get to take
35:58
the baby from the nurseries and i have a
36:00
picture
36:01
here's one of the nursery walls that i
36:03
saw in heaven right here
36:07
and i gotta make sure that the lights
36:09
not reflecting tilt it down
36:12
oh here yeah there we go
36:15
that's good if you can see that these
36:17
are some of the babies beds that were on
36:19
this nursery wall i saw now they weren't
36:21
sleeping
36:22
babies don't have to sleep in heaven but
36:24
they have these beautiful
36:26
like a little niche these are little
36:27
tiny babies most of them
36:29
and the angels give them a nickname
36:32
unless the parents have named them
36:34
and they grow so slowly birds come in
36:37
and the birds take them for rides around
36:40
heaven
36:41
all kinds of fun things for them to do
36:42
they can sing laugh
36:44
dance and god has this beautiful place
36:47
for them
36:48
and they will be there until either the
36:50
grandparents come home or somebody close
36:53
to that baby in
36:54
relation they get to take them and keep
36:56
them to the parents get there
36:57
the parents take turns raising them and
37:00
eventually
37:01
they grow they step into the gift
37:04
remember we talked about gifts they each
37:06
have a gift
37:07
whether it could be anything designing
37:10
um
37:10
it could be like music it could be art
37:12
it could be dance it could be culinary
37:14
arts
37:15
it could be creating all kinds of gifts
37:17
and things for people
37:18
making things out of gems i know they
37:20
have jewelers and things in heaven
37:21
whatever their natural gift is
37:23
they'll still use that in heaven they'll
37:25
step into their gift and eventually
37:27
they will have their own mansion when we
37:29
come home to heaven we come home as
37:31
god's son
37:32
or daughter and all those babies will be
37:35
growing in the most beautiful amazing
37:37
place
37:38
loved by jesus himself and fun places
37:41
that he made for them so
37:43
your babies know who you are they
37:46
definitely can't wait for you to get to
37:47
heaven so that was beautiful you brought
37:49
that jen
37:50
okay um this question is
37:53
from jan vincent and he wants to know
37:58
if you can practice christianity and
38:01
witchcraft
38:02
no and what if you
38:05
you cannot claims that he pray for
38:08
people and heal people with jesus name
38:10
but yet also do witchcraft stuff
38:12
i will tell you what the bible says
38:14
there'll be some people who go there one
38:15
day and jesus will say depart from me i
38:18
never knew you
38:19
you cannot practice evil and
38:23
say you are a believer too you cannot do
38:25
both
38:26
when you become when you practice
38:28
witchcraft you're partnering with satan
38:31
even the bible talks about that it was
38:33
called necromancing
38:35
in the bible and it's all evil it
38:38
belongs to
38:39
satan witchcraft controls and i know
38:42
that one day they'll actually be
38:43
people that are called themselves good
38:45
witches there is no good witch
38:47
and i've heard from some of them myself
38:49
and let me tell you when you partner
38:51
with satan
38:52
he will lie to you deceive you but you
38:55
cannot you have to choose one or the
38:57
other
38:58
because christianity you believe in
39:00
jesus christ as your savior he does
39:02
not tolerate witchcraft he never
39:05
practiced witchcraft he spoke against
39:07
witchcraft
39:08
even himself in the new testament so
39:10
it's wrong it belongs to the enemy
39:13
and this is a thing people will get
39:15
healed in the name of jesus
39:17
it's jesus's name healing them but that
39:20
doesn't mean
39:20
they get reward for that and the bible
39:22
says will be people who come before god
39:25
there's also people who say they're a
39:26
christian but they sin
39:28
in bad ways they sin but they go hold
39:32
meetings people get saved
39:34
they'll get healed they may get words
39:36
from god
39:37
because that doesn't stop operating you
39:40
the way you choose your own life to live
39:42
and what you personally choose
39:44
yourself will be demonstrated by the way
39:47
you live your life that means you can't
39:49
be a witch and you can't belong to jesus
39:51
you have to choose
39:52
okay because when you die
39:56
whoever owns you or you serve
39:59
will come to get you and if you're
40:02
practicing witchcraft that gives the
40:03
enemy the right to come and get you when
40:05
you die
40:06
so i would not mess around with that get
40:08
witchcraft out of your life
40:10
i pray for people to be delivered from
40:12
witchcraft spirits
40:13
that doesn't come from god so don't play
40:16
around
40:16
don't read books on witchcraft don't go
40:18
see movies about witchcraft
40:20
you're opening a door in your soul for
40:22
the enemy to begin to control
40:24
you and these people who think they can
40:26
be do both
40:27
are under a great deception
40:30
so i'm just saying there's evil people
40:33
people who are doing wrong
40:34
sinning but going and having meetings
40:36
people come they get
40:38
saved by the name of jesus they get
40:39
healed by the name of jesus they get
40:41
worse because the holy spirit is going
40:42
to speak to those people
40:44
it isn't that person okay don't follow
40:47
people who you know
40:48
are sinning don't do it because you
40:52
follow jesus christ those who believe
40:54
the word of god and live the word of god
40:56
there's double accountability for
40:58
leaders and so he will hold them doubly
41:00
accountable but it says one day when
41:02
they come before him
41:03
and want the reward there will not only
41:05
be no reward he will not
41:07
allow them to remain okay
41:10
so you can't you can't do evil and do
41:13
god you have to choose god you cannot
41:16
have evil in your life
41:18
and witchcraft is one of those satanism
41:20
is witchcraft
41:22
any false religion don't try to practice
41:24
two religions at the same time
41:26
any witchcraft and you don't allow it in
41:28
you make sure you're running your race
41:30
to make a difference
41:31
for jesus christ it says for us to be
41:34
like him
41:36
he didn't practice any of that he
41:37
actually spoke against it
41:39
so those people are deceived there you
41:42
go
41:45
okay um this one's really long but i'm
41:47
not going to read the whole entire thing
41:49
and uh again you have discussed this but
41:53
um this is from charity um
41:56
herself and she says she has such a
41:58
struggle with being you know you can
42:00
share on this
42:01
experience i can share on this i
42:03
absolutely can share on this
42:05
and number one i want to let you know
42:06
this god does not approve of any
42:09
violence
42:10
no abuse okay no kind of abuse
42:12
whatsoever
42:13
whether it's physical abuse verbal abuse
42:16
god is against that
42:18
and and let me tell you this that he
42:21
would rather you be by yourself than be
42:23
with someone who's abusing you
42:25
i know that many spiritual leaders
42:27
through the years have said uh and it
42:30
can happen on both sides okay i'm not
42:32
saying i know women that were violence
42:33
and abuse their husbands and i know men
42:35
that were violent and abused their wives
42:37
it happened on both sides so you can't
42:39
say one is worse than the other
42:40
abuse is abuse okay uh but for instance
42:44
let's just say for instance
42:46
i had prayed for people before they were
42:47
under severe abuse
42:49
and this was a wife and she was abused
42:51
physically all the time and when she
42:53
went to her pastor they would say
42:55
you cannot leave your husband the bible
42:56
says you cannot do that
42:58
no that was not the right thing to say
43:00
to them okay god does not
43:02
put up with abuse he doesn't approve of
43:05
anybody abusing anybody you
43:07
certainly have the right to not be
43:08
abused and this is the thing
43:11
if it is sin let's just say it's sin
43:14
if we say it sin sins can be forgiven
43:17
if you divorced and it wasn't out of
43:20
abuse when you just divorced you didn't
43:21
want that person you
43:22
you divorced them you can go before god
43:25
and say i repent
43:26
of that that doesn't mean you have to go
43:28
back to the person you're already
43:29
divorced
43:29
your pen is wiped away sin is wiped away
43:33
people
43:34
you can't hold those sins against people
43:36
not even things they did 30 years ago
43:38
if they repented of those things then
43:40
god doesn't remember them anymore
43:43
and i happen to know myself personally
43:45
some people don't like me after i tell
43:47
them this
43:48
i went out and picked out somebody it
43:49
wasn't god's choice
43:52
this is what the bible says and god came
43:54
to me himself one day and i was abused
43:57
horribly uh when i was married to
43:59
somebody else and god came to me and
44:00
said how long are you going to put up
44:02
with that
44:03
and i said well what should i do about
44:04
it he said you have a contract you don't
44:06
have a covenant
44:08
he said my word says what god has joined
44:11
together
44:12
let not man put asunder what that means
44:16
is don't let man
44:17
end it he said if if god put it together
44:21
if it was god
44:22
who brought you together and then again
44:24
even if you did and you repented
44:26
for doing that later it's still forgiven
44:29
okay people don't like it when i say
44:30
that
44:31
sin is sin if you repent it's forgiven
44:34
no matter what kind of sin that is it's
44:36
it says that he remembers it no more
44:39
he's not going to treat you like a lower
44:41
human being
44:42
okay god's not going to do that i'm
44:44
still pursuing my destiny
44:46
i repented of that and uh god said end
44:49
the contract so we i got divorced
44:51
because god told me to
44:53
he said you'll never be who i need you
44:54
to be if you remain married to that
44:56
person i didn't bring you that person
44:57
that is not my choice
44:59
that's not a covenant a covenant is when
45:01
i bring you together
45:02
i didn't look for anyone god brought me
45:04
the husband i have now we've been
45:05
married 43 years
45:07
and let me tell you a marriage is a
45:09
trial
45:11
it's a trial it's a challenge because
45:13
you've got two individuals
45:15
coming together as one maybe you like
45:17
different things you do things different
45:19
ways make sure that you're marrying the
45:20
person god
45:21
has for you and even then there could be
45:24
conflict but make sure you're praying
45:26
for each other i'm just going to include
45:28
all this in this package that's not just
45:30
a yes or no thing
45:31
now yes or no abuse is as bad as
45:35
running around on your spouse it's still
45:38
abuse
45:39
that is mental abuse if you're married
45:41
and you go find someone else and sleep
45:43
with them and you you choose them
45:45
over your spouse and you're still
45:46
married and all this is going on
45:48
that is sin that is for sure sin but
45:50
it's abuse
45:52
god puts abuse in that same line that
45:55
says
45:56
that talks about adultery in that home
45:58
meaning
45:59
is severe abuse and that's what he
46:02
recognizes even in the bible
46:04
that you can be divorced if that happens
46:07
this is a very touchy question but i
46:08
don't mind answering it okay
46:11
i suffered a lot of abuse but put up
46:13
with it for six and a half years until
46:15
i finally said to god what do i do and
46:17
he said how long are you going to
46:18
tolerate it
46:20
i had to repent to the person i married
46:22
i didn't even love them i had to repent
46:24
to them
46:25
i'd repent for them that that had to be
46:26
ended because god had asked me to end it
46:29
so there was repentance on my side and
46:31
then god brought me the right person
46:33
and i married them because he said you
46:34
will marry this person
46:36
so people can fight and argue and yell
46:39
all you want to it's about
46:40
what you repent from if it was wrong
46:43
what you did it's been ended and it's
46:45
over
46:46
and maybe the other person is remarried
46:48
he certainly doesn't expect you to go
46:50
after them and make them remarry you
46:52
you repent for the whole situation give
46:54
yourself to god
46:56
and he probably most more than likely
46:58
will bring you
46:59
somebody else to be with you god doesn't
47:01
want us to be alone okay
47:03
and the reason why he has marriage is so
47:05
we don't have to go through this
47:07
life alone it says the marriage bed that
47:10
means you know what that means that
47:12
means a living together having physical
47:14
relations
47:14
when you're married god approves of that
47:17
when you're not married and you live
47:18
together and do that he does not approve
47:20
of that
47:21
and there's many reasons why because
47:22
when you come together
47:24
you're actually sharing your soul with
47:25
each other this is more than you ever
47:27
thought you were going to get this is
47:28
what happens when you ask the deep
47:29
questions okay
47:30
and the more of yourself you give when
47:32
you're married you're empowering each
47:34
other
47:35
but when you're not married and you're
47:36
sharing physical relations with each
47:38
other you're giving parts of your soul
47:40
away layers that you shouldn't be doing
47:41
that to someone you're not married to
47:44
so there's your whole story it's all
47:47
about
47:47
abiding in god married they're
47:49
christians and they marry someone who's
47:51
not it's a much
47:52
harder lifestyle if they don't want to
47:54
agree with what you're doing maybe
47:56
make sure you find that up before you
47:58
get married
47:59
but i can tell you that if anyone
48:02
repents
48:03
they are forgiven and you can't drag
48:06
that stuff up and throw it back in their
48:08
face again
48:09
because what you that is then wrong okay
48:12
you have to forgive too
48:14
even it was something that was done to
48:15
you that that unforgiveness will hurt
48:18
you
48:18
worse than what you experienced before
48:20
in your life
48:21
get rid of all unforgiveness and all
48:23
offense
48:25
no matter what it was and you run your
48:28
race
48:28
and let god bless you and so there's
48:31
that very long answer about that
48:33
question but god
48:34
doesn't tolerate abuse in any marriage
48:37
no physical abuse no mental or emotional
48:40
abuse
48:41
that beats you up until you feel like
48:43
you're nothing at all
48:44
he doesn't want you to stay in a
48:46
situation like that okay he doesn't
48:49
and so uh pray let god open doors of
48:52
safety for you
48:53
and you seek him to see what you're
48:54
supposed to do next
48:56
but he does love you there you go
49:02
so um somebody actually asked me a
49:04
question
49:05
oh wow jen what did they ask you they
49:08
wanted to know if i've ever been to
49:11
heaven
49:12
okay so come over here and say thank me
49:16
if they ask you then you give them their
49:18
answer
49:19
hey
49:22
i'm kind of in my gym clothes still it's
49:24
okay everybody looks like that right now
49:27
anyway so i've never
49:30
been to heaven but i have had um
49:34
three open visions uh during the time
49:38
that i was writing the
49:39
the first children's book and well two
49:42
times were with the first children's
49:43
book
49:44
and then the third time was during the
49:46
well
49:47
well i've been writing the second but he
49:49
did something special for you didn't he
49:51
yes um when i was writing the first book
49:55
i wrote one sentence down and i was in
49:58
my office and my whole office went black
50:00
and then my wall kind of opened up like
50:03
a movie screen
50:04
and i it was like i was seeing
50:07
the book come alive so it was all in
50:11
cartoon
50:12
form every time i've ever had an open
50:15
vision about heaven it's been in cartoon
50:17
form that's cool
50:18
and so i was seeing the characters in
50:20
the book and
50:21
walking down the streets of gold and um
50:24
one of the times
50:25
that that happened they were going into
50:28
the amusement park which
50:29
kat talks about in her first book and i
50:32
was seeing all kinds of things
50:34
um and things that i had never heard her
50:37
talk about and so it was like i was
50:40
walking with them
50:42
i didn't see myself on the path but i
50:44
knew i was walking with them seeing my
50:45
characters walking down the streets of
50:47
gold and
50:48
going into the amusement park and one of
50:51
the things that really fascinated me
50:53
which is going to be in the first kids
50:55
book is
50:56
i saw a merry-go-round and instead of
51:01
uh the horses that you sit on there are
51:04
actual
51:04
live animals and they were whole the the
51:08
people
51:08
children adults and there were even some
51:11
animals writing on there so it looks
51:12
like
51:13
animals it was quite funny um but they
51:16
were riding on the backs and they had
51:18
rains
51:18
and then instead of their little
51:20
platform yeah instead of a pole
51:22
being down the middle um they were on a
51:24
platform that would go up and down
51:27
and i had never heard her talk about i
51:29
didn't know that and so
51:30
i was so excited it went in when the
51:33
vision was over i come running out of my
51:35
office to tell her what i saw and
51:37
and she's like yeah that's up there so
51:40
um and there were other things that i
51:41
saw
51:42
too and what what were some of the well
51:44
or some of the animals you could write
51:45
on jen not what you would think
51:47
yes it is was
51:50
um dinosaurs there was even a whale
51:54
so apparently somebody had always wanted
51:55
to ride a whale i mean i guess it
51:57
it wasn't huge so it shrunk down to fit
52:00
on the merry-go-round but
52:01
there was a seahorse that didn't need
52:03
water to breathe no
52:04
it didn't it didn't and there was uh
52:07
jungle animals
52:08
uh you know like elephants and lions and
52:11
real ones
52:12
yeah real ones breathing ones and it was
52:14
really cool
52:15
and uh there was like a little raccoon
52:17
that was on the back
52:18
of i think it was like a hippo or
52:20
something it was so funny
52:22
but um yeah and they like lollipops
52:25
don't they
52:25
yes the raccoons like yeah yeah because
52:28
they even saw a raccoon riding on the
52:29
rush
52:33
yeah so that that was my experience and
52:35
it was it's happened three times now
52:37
yeah and uh so yeah that'd be awesome
52:41
yeah yeah that was a great answer i'm
52:43
back over here now
52:44
okay maybe a couple more questions so
52:47
that we can we do have a couple more
52:48
things
52:49
i have to do today but how much fun is
52:52
this to just have a
52:52
just a spontaneous q a session and now
52:55
you find out
52:56
some people can see heaven and cartoon
52:58
form that would be really cool
53:01
so oh let's see and so when you see like
53:05
you know
53:06
teal squirrels or or purple elephants
53:10
yes that exists in heaven everything is
53:13
different colors
53:14
in heaven i love when you talk about the
53:15
messenger squirrels
53:17
yes that we're talking the greeters the
53:19
breeders i've always called a messenger
53:21
squirrels
53:22
they're greeters they sing and dance
53:23
with top hats the squirrels when you
53:25
have a party somewhere in your home yes
53:27
people have
53:28
parties and they come to entertain and
53:30
they have top hats and canes and some of
53:32
the best dancers i've ever seen
53:34
and you you you just you know get home
53:37
and say hey we're having a party we'd
53:38
like for you to come do some
53:40
some of your performance you never know
53:42
what's going to happen up there it's
53:44
just great
53:46
so what would you say to someone who's
53:48
been praying and asking
53:50
to see jesus and angels and it hasn't
53:53
happened yet
53:54
i would say um stop praying and asking
53:57
and start thanking him
53:58
i'm real serious about that because it
54:01
happens at the most unexpected times and
54:04
it's usually
54:05
not when you're asking i'm just gonna
54:08
give you a free little tip
54:10
and many times it's not when you're
54:12
praying either
54:13
most of my encounters i have in heaven
54:15
is not when i'm praying
54:16
somewhere i'm not even reading my bible
54:19
i'm doing everyday stuff
54:21
and he catches me up and sometimes i'm
54:23
doing everyday stuff and then an angel
54:25
walk up
54:26
walk up and say something or i'll see
54:27
them doing things or
54:29
um so you have to just understand
54:33
you think if you don't get in some
54:34
spiritual position
54:37
of what you think would be proper then
54:40
it's not going to happen
54:41
jesus also visits me when i least expect
54:44
it
54:45
and so i would just say expect have an
54:47
expectancy
54:48
that is going to happen you know and i
54:51
you know maybe share to people i'm
54:52
expecting this to happen
54:54
and you'd be surprised how soon or
54:57
quickly it happens then
54:59
well i know the first time i saw an
55:00
angel which was
55:02
um um the one that was watching
55:07
uh ben do the shipping and receiving
55:10
yeah we've seen
55:11
i was working at my desk typing right
55:13
here in this room
55:15
and at the core of my eye i just see
55:17
this most radical looking angel
55:20
leaning he's just like like this
55:22
watching him
55:23
pack up the products to ship out and i
55:25
was like okay
55:27
and i just kept on typing
55:30
you know what even the angels love it
55:32
that we're sharing heaven and all of our
55:34
products
55:35
represent something about heaven or
55:37
living righteously or being dangerous
55:39
against hell
55:41
all of the products we put up for that
55:43
reason and we we do have mp3s now we
55:45
have dvds cds
55:47
mp3s we have photographs we have
55:50
artwork now we have calendars we have
55:53
cups we have all kinds of stuff we're
55:54
creating
55:56
um to to demonstrate and manifest heaven
56:00
like here's one of the cups right here i
56:01
have one
56:02
it says i don't do
56:06
demons and there's a little lightning
56:09
bolt representing when they were all
56:10
kicked out of heaven you know
56:12
then once you follow loose for that's
56:13
what that lightning bolt represents some
56:15
hell doesn't like it that we market
56:17
stuff like this because
56:19
it points fingers at them anyway so we
56:22
do all kinds of things so angels are
56:24
going to be present
56:25
even if you don't see them they're
56:26
present if you're speaking on behalf of
56:28
god
56:29
when you're praying they're there your
56:31
angels always there maybe turn around
56:33
every now and then say thank you for
56:34
watching over me
56:36
that's perfectly okay you're not sitting
56:37
down having tea with them however if god
56:39
allows it enjoy it
56:42
we're living in a different life and
56:44
time now and i know that before the end
56:46
does come which is generations away
56:49
it will be normal for you to see angels
56:51
in your home
56:52
and angels in your car outside your car
56:55
because they're there all the time i see
56:56
them
56:57
and i know more and more the spiritual
57:00
realm
57:00
and these are spiritual beings in the
57:02
spirit realm the spirit realm will be
57:04
more
57:05
and more visible in our lives so you
57:08
live in a great time
57:10
okay you live in a great time and great
57:11
things are about to happen in this earth
57:14
even in the midst of everything else
57:16
god has his plans and so i would just
57:18
encourage you we'll probably take one
57:19
more question and that will be it for
57:21
today
57:22
and you never know when we're going to
57:23
show back up again
57:25
yes i i hope that you're enjoying this
57:29
time with us
57:30
and uh even though it was unplanned i
57:32
love spontaneous spontaneous still
57:35
happens in heaven
57:36
okay okay and so uh well we'll
57:39
let jen um okay share one more question
57:42
um okay this might take a while but i
57:45
know we've discussed this before
57:48
that's okay someone wants to know i
57:51
don't i don't didn't see who
57:53
asked the question but someone wants to
57:54
know is the
57:56
virus the mark of the beast or the the
57:59
vaccine
57:59
the vaccine it's the mark of the beast
58:02
uh we we've had this long
58:04
conversation about this everything is
58:08
many years something comes up that is
58:11
the mark of the beast yes and i have
58:12
lived along with you and let me tell you
58:14
they were doing it back in the 50s
58:17
oh i was alive oh even mom it
58:20
my our mom who was born in the 30s she
58:22
was born in the 30s
58:24
they said even back then they were
58:25
saying that the rapture was coming
58:27
the rapture was coming you know you know
58:30
what he says about all that just so you
58:32
know
58:33
revelation 21 the very end of the bible
58:37
okay the very end of the bible there's
58:39
so much still
58:40
that has to happen the best of things
58:43
other than christ being born
58:45
him dying on the cross tearing up hell
58:48
wasting hell
58:49
okay those were amazing powerful things
58:51
the holy spirit coming
58:52
those were great times but we're
58:54
entering into some of the most powerful
58:56
exciting times as a believer
59:00
that's your life that's the what you
59:02
what's coming for your life
59:04
okay but i can tell you the mark of the
59:06
beast
59:07
is nowhere right now there's nothing
59:09
that's been created on the earth that
59:10
is the mark of the beast at all in any
59:13
way whatsoever
59:14
it isn't the michael chip oh no they
59:16
used to say the bar code okay when i was
59:18
going to the barcode
59:19
you're going to walk around with a bar
59:20
called this big on your head right that
59:22
was going to be the mark of the beast
59:24
this is the crazy thing i will say this
59:26
the mark
59:27
a mark is a visible mark you will see it
59:31
a visible permanent mark you will see it
59:33
with your eyes
59:34
it's not something hidden in your skin
59:36
it's not something that will happen
59:38
or a frequency that will be around no
59:40
it's not the 5g
59:41
it's not 5g people this is what god said
59:44
about 5g
59:45
that just means the gospel will go
59:47
further and stronger than ever before
59:50
around the world around the world which
59:52
is his purpose so don't look for the 5g
59:54
to be the mark of the beast that can't
59:56
even happen
59:56
okay the antichrist is not on the earth
59:59
the
60:00
spirit or the attitude or the nature
60:04
antichrist means anything that's against
60:06
christ himself
60:08
anything that speaks truth and hope is
60:11
and then that is the that is the truth
60:13
but anything that speaks against it
60:16
is an antichrist spirit jesus said even
60:18
now the antichrist spirit is in the
60:20
earth he didn't mean the person
60:22
he met the way it will operate he will
60:24
speak against
60:25
god the antichrist will be against jesus
60:28
christ
60:28
his holiness his sovereignty it will
60:31
speak
60:32
totally against all of that that that
60:35
stuff is going on but the antichrist
60:37
himself has not been born how about that
60:39
one people
60:40
he's not on the earth because he
60:41
couldn't operate in his fullness
60:43
with the body of christ taking authority
60:46
over the earth ruling and reigning on
60:47
christ
60:48
uh changing things speaking to things
60:51
it wouldn't be able to be here he
60:53
couldn't be here in the time when the
60:56
antichrist comes the whole world will be
60:58
falling apart
61:00
millions of people will be missing off
61:02
of the earth it will be a
61:03
horrible experience for people and he
61:06
will be
61:07
their their protector he will be their
61:10
savior the antichrist will have answers
61:12
for all that stuff
61:13
he's not here that stuff is not
61:16
happening
61:16
so no the mark of the beast is not out
61:19
here somewhere
61:20
but it will be a permanent visible mark
61:22
and satan will make sure people
61:24
want to take it back in the days of that
61:26
happening
61:27
and you will see it walking down the
61:29
street he can't force you to take it
61:31
people because it would defeat his
61:32
purpose
61:33
his purpose he wants to flaunt that
61:36
people want him and they they want him
61:38
to be there
61:40
so this is not the time for any of that
61:42
it's not the time of the four horses of
61:44
the apocalypse it's not the time for the
61:46
wormwood whatever to hit the earth
61:48
it isn't time for death and destruction
61:51
it isn't it is the time for the the
61:54
knowledge
61:55
and understanding and the operation of
61:57
the glory the power of god
62:00
seen going around the earth
62:03
in these days there's baptism in fire
62:05
that will burn all the fear out of you
62:07
all the world out of you okay
62:09
that has not happened yet okay the
62:11
manifested sons and daughters speaking
62:13
to earthquakes to make them stop and put
62:15
it back the way it was before it
62:16
happened or anybody died
62:18
that's a manifested son or daughter
62:20
raising the dead that were cremated
62:21
that's a manifested son or daughter are
62:23
you seeing that
62:24
it's not even happening but we have to
62:27
have this in the earth
62:28
because she said it would be here and
62:31
the wealth of the will
62:32
the wealth of the wicked has to be
62:33
transferred to the just and the
62:34
righteous
62:35
those things haven't even started
62:38
stop asking if the mark of the beast is
62:41
out there
62:41
stop asking if this is the end and
62:44
everything's going to crash and just be
62:45
blown away
62:47
it isn't and i have news for you the
62:49
earth won't even stop
62:50
being here until after the tribulation
62:54
is
62:54
over and it's done and gone they'll
62:57
still be natural people on the earth
62:59
jesus christ will sit on the throne in
63:01
jerusalem
63:02
for one thousand years when all of that
63:06
is
63:06
done and gone many of us will be in
63:09
heaven
63:09
okay and then the earth then jesus will
63:12
be king of the world for one thousand
63:14
years will be no wars no weapons will
63:16
even be used
63:17
saint will be in the bottomless pit just
63:20
falling
63:21
he will not even be on the earth
63:22
there'll be no evil on the earth at the
63:23
time there'll be people who don't want
63:25
christ
63:25
on the earth so you can see that even at
63:28
the end of this
63:29
age we're in which is still got quite a
63:32
few generations to it
63:34
the next age after this age will be the
63:36
millennial age so the earth will still
63:37
be here
63:38
it'll still be operating it says people
63:40
will still be getting married and being
63:42
given a marriage so don't try to make
63:45
god's will be pushed into a little box
63:49
of what people have told you it will be
63:51
this is not the last day
63:54
this is not the perilous times where you
63:56
can't build you can't eat there won't be
63:58
anything to do
64:00
you'll barely be able to breathe you
64:02
won't see blue sky
64:03
you won't even be here during that time
64:06
you are
64:06
here during some of the greatest days on
64:08
the earth and i'm just going to
64:10
end with this because it is so powerful
64:12
to understand god's timing
64:14
he has things in his own word he wrote
64:18
if they're still in some of the newer
64:20
bibles i hope they leave them in there
64:23
the perilous times have not happened the
64:25
tribulation has not happened
64:27
it will not happen for quite a long time
64:31
your focus is to know christ
64:34
to have an intimate relationship to
64:37
speak hope
64:38
life create things invent things
64:42
give people hope for a future not
64:46
demon gloom okay god himself the father
64:49
is the only one who decides when jesus
64:51
comes back and he is too busy ruling and
64:53
reigning with us
64:54
okay so look for greatness look for
64:57
god's plan for your life
64:59
run after it don't sit him on the curb
65:01
somewhere make sure he stays with you
65:04
no holy spirit and know that you
65:08
are chosen to be here now
65:12
you are not chosen for wrath we
65:15
as the body of christ have not been
65:17
appointed unto wrath
65:19
so we won't be here there will be people
65:22
saved during the times of the
65:23
tribulation
65:24
those are other people who were not
65:26
christians before that happened okay
65:29
you focus on what he wants right now
65:31
which is he wants you to be great for
65:33
him in the earth
65:35
bring hope and life watch your words
65:37
watch your choices
65:38
but live happy
65:41
make sure you have fun because heaven
65:44
is half fun and half powerful
65:48
it's so filled with splendor glory and
65:50
awe
65:51
of god fun as a weapon against fun
65:54
is a weapon when you're having fun the
65:56
enemy doesn't like it
65:58
so make sure you're using confusion too
66:00
yes it confuses his head
66:03
because he can't understand why he's not
66:04
keeping you crushed down
66:06
all right run after god himself
66:10
and let god take care of all the rest of
66:13
that stuff
66:13
don't look for the mark of the beast
66:15
it's not going to come in the letter
66:16
it's not going to come in an email
66:18
nobody can send it to you nobody can put
66:20
it on you
66:21
they can't force you to take it so
66:22
you're not even in the generation that
66:24
will be a part of that
66:26
that means you are here to do powerful
66:29
amazing things with him
66:30
let your faith build trust god
66:34
regardless of what's going on yes i've
66:36
been through hard things before my life
66:37
but i trusted him even when i had
66:39
nothing
66:40
i trusted him and believed his word and
66:43
i
66:43
told him i did bless his heart bless
66:47
your angels heart
66:48
by declaring the things of god it'll
66:51
change the atmosphere where you live
66:53
choose god choose life be powerful in
66:57

66:59

02:10
and i just want to add this about the
02:11
northwest did you not know
02:14
the places that are the most significant
02:16
to god are the ones that are attacked
02:18
the most by the enemy
02:20
and that's why satan wants to keep that
02:23
area dry because
02:24
it is like a wellspring i'm not just a
02:27
well but a wellspring
02:28
and i'm telling you god is going to
02:30
explode from that area and come
02:32
from that very corner of uh this country
02:35
and flood all over the place so
02:37
just stay excited everybody and don't
02:40
miss it don't miss this
02:41
event that's gonna happen wow that's
02:44
powerful because
02:46
uh you know you're talking about
02:47
wellsprings and really i want to talk
02:49
right now
02:50
about the wellsprings of revival i
02:51
believe we are in a season where god is
02:55
re-digging or digging up the old wells
02:57
like in the days of isaac
02:59
yeah and he's also digging up new wells
03:02
the old wells and the new wells and of
03:04
course right now
03:05
we're in the month of february it's it's
03:07
my favorite uh month of the year why
03:09
because it's my birthday month
03:11
so welcome to february everybody but of
03:14
course in this
03:15
month uh catherine coleman passed
03:19
uh billy graham pass john paul jackson
03:23
bob jones and paul kane so i really feel
03:25
like
03:26
kat and sherelle did this season god
03:29
wants us to dig
03:30
up the old wells and the new whales of
03:34
revival
03:34
in america because we're in a new season
03:37
now
03:38
i want to ask you miss cat what do you
03:40
think about that word
03:42
and what god's doing and digging up the
03:44
old wells
03:45
and the new wells right now well i do
03:47
know this
03:48
that he's definitely in a generational
03:50
thing right now
03:52
which means the generations of the past
03:54
and everything that they did
03:56
and made as a foundation is going to
03:58
explode
03:59
in this in the generations of this uh
04:02
time on the earth
04:03
and those who are alive on the earth
04:05
it's going to really it's going to
04:07
accelerate
04:08
everybody forward and upward and so yes
04:11
i definitely agree with that the things
04:12
that the people lay down their lives for
04:14
i love it that in the month of love
04:18
you know god took all those mighty men
04:21
and women home
04:22
and i actually knew bob jones would go
04:24
home the father told me the birth of
04:26
february and taking bob home on the 14th
04:28
and he said it's going to open up whole
04:30
new portals whole new gates
04:32
all over this nation and he said so
04:34
everybody needs to be excited
04:36
and you know but that was several years
04:37
ago but that doesn't matter god builds
04:39
on things he knew everything that would
04:42
happen and yet he's still gonna do
04:44
everything he wants but this is what
04:45
we'll have at the end
04:46
we will have great victory and great
04:49
celebration
04:51

04:54

07:42
wow amen and amen absolutely i i feel
07:45
like right now
07:46
because of where our conversation's
07:48
going i feel like we need to talk about
07:51
what is god doing in this month of
07:52
february what is god going to do
07:56
in our country and in the nations of the
07:58
earth that i just feel such an
08:00
expectation and an anticipation
08:03
because february is going to be a mega
08:05
month of miracles
08:07
so let's talk about that right now and i
08:09
want to
08:10
pass to mike in the florida prophetess
08:12
sherelle what do you what do you sense
08:14
what do you expect
08:15
god to do in this month of february in
08:18
this season right now
08:20
well it's it just blew my mind that as
08:23
soon as you guys got on here you started
08:25
talking about
08:26
the wells of revival i don't know if you
08:28
guys
08:29
know about a prophetess named fuchsia
08:32
pickett
08:33
but she was a prophetess back here in
08:35
the 70s i believe
08:37
and she i was reading some of her book
08:39
last night and she was talking about how
08:42
wellsprings of revival were going to
08:45
burst up in certain areas of this
08:48
uh of washington and this area over here
08:52
and so
08:53
i began to see a vision when i was
08:56
reading that
08:57
and i saw the lord show me that there's
08:59
been like
09:00
holes of revival in the grounds of the
09:03
earth here
09:03
and some people have sown seeds of faith
09:06
and they've prayed and they've prepared
09:09
the way
09:10
and revival has come up to the surface
09:13
a couple times but man put his foot
09:17
on the coals man tried to stop the move
09:21
of the holy spirit and what the lord is
09:24
saying to me
09:25
about these next few months is that we
09:28
are going to be led by the spirit the
09:31
spirit
09:32
is going to lead us man is no longer
09:34
going to lead the spirit
09:36
and it's i'm i'm excited i just feel
09:39
like the holy spirit what the lord
09:41
showed me in 2017
09:44
he told me that the holy spirit will be
09:46
given a platform
09:48
and that's what we're seeing in this
09:49
season a place
09:52
that is cultivating revival by letting
09:55
the holy spirit
09:56
lead amen and you know just uh just to
10:00
piggyback on that you know
10:02
really the next three months i want you
10:05
to hear these words
10:06
because the next three months there's
10:08
going to be
10:09
monumental momentum that's going to take
10:12
place
10:13
from now passover i wish somebody heard
10:16
me today
10:17
from today february 1 to passover which
10:21
is of course in the middle of april
10:23
for the next three months there's going
10:24
to be mega momentum
10:26
monumental momentum that's going to
10:29
shift you
10:31
into harvest and into miracles so
10:33
there's going to be a lot of setup
10:35
for financial miracles miracles in your
10:38
business and even salvation
10:39
in your family but from now to passover
10:42
begin to prepare
10:44
because there's going to be mega setups
10:47
for your divine breakthrough
10:48
now before i pass the mic over uh to the
10:51
woman of god
10:52
cancur i just want to read the scripture
10:54
because we're talking about whales
10:56
because i believe god is springing up
10:59
wells right now in the spirit
11:01
genesis 26 18 isaac
11:04
reopened someone said reopened which
11:06
means it was closed but he opened up
11:08
again
11:09
isaac reopened the wells
11:12
that had been dug up in the time of his
11:15
father
11:15
abraham which the philistines ding ding
11:18
ding key were
11:19
philistines which are enemy opposing
11:22
giants
11:23
the giants of the land the giants of
11:27
welfare of poverty of socialism the
11:29
giants of
11:30
human trafficking of the elitist the
11:34
philistines had stopped the whales
11:37
after abraham died and so
11:41
right now these giants of the land of
11:43
201 are trying to
11:45
stop the wells or stop the flow of your
11:48
finances stop the flow
11:50
of the holy spirit stop the flow of
11:53
revival but
11:54
god wants to anoint you to dig
11:57
up and open up again what has been
12:00
closed
12:01
by these philistines these opposing
12:03
giants
12:04
and god's going to be doing it from
12:06
today february 1st all the way to
12:08
passover so you watch
12:10
god's about to open up miss cat what are
12:12
your thoughts here what do you want to
12:13
say to the people right now
12:15
i i have to say exactly what the father
12:18
is continually saying to me
12:20
don't we don't lose that um that spirit
12:24
of celebration
12:25
and maybe you don't know this people but
12:28
celebrating in heaven is
12:29
mainly what they do it's one of the ways
12:31
they worship god it's one of the ways
12:33
they
12:34
are are thankful and grateful to him for
12:36
all the things that they
12:37
that he did for us while we were on
12:39
earth and also once they get to heaven
12:41
and so they are celebrating in heaven
12:43
already and i do
12:44
know another prophet uh hank kuhneman
12:47
who always talks about
12:48
january february and march that leads
12:50
into april
12:51
and he is almost in line with what
12:53
you're saying he says that january will
12:55
begin to bring justice
12:57
february will be all the fireworks of
12:59
the beginning of everything happening
13:01
and then marching into the end of the
13:03
march will be great celebration and
13:05
miraculous
13:06
so uh that's what he has heard from god
13:08
i can tell you that i continually hear
13:11
that justice is already beginning to be
13:13
served and all the stuff that's going on
13:15
and just let me add what the father just
13:18
shared with me
13:19
yesterday about all the stuff going on
13:21
we know
13:22
that those who are now sitting in seats
13:25
of authority
13:26
are illegitimate that's what the father
13:28
says is illegitimate
13:30
power in other words not power given in
13:32
the natural
13:33
not power given in the spirit you know
13:35
the whoever is the head of a government
13:38
it says that when the righteous are in
13:40
power the people rejoice but when it's
13:42
the wicked and the evil are
13:44
that great the sadness comes upon them
13:46
well i need to remind
13:48
everybody that right now those who are
13:51
in authority don't have power not
13:53
real power which will be shown and
13:55
proven when that great victory comes
13:58
and god will shift back what his
14:00
intentions always were
14:02
and the truth is this the one who is in
14:04
true authority even
14:05
right now yeah which is trump
14:08
he is actually a president he did win
14:11
the election
14:12
and he is the one in authority still
14:14
welcoming god still having plans by the
14:16
way he's still getting ready to work
14:17
plans i just have to let you all know
14:19
that
14:20
and it's beginning to be no secret that
14:21
that's happening so there's a lot of
14:23
people
14:23
right now in dc very afraid demons are
14:27
leaving dc like crazy i mean they're
14:29
just leaving racing out of there
14:31
and this is what god said that is
14:33
because it's
14:34
illegitimate power so those who are
14:37
righteous right now
14:39
they are still in power they're the ones
14:41
in power
14:42
and what he says what our president says
14:44
the true president says
14:46
is what will affect this cup this
14:47
country not just in the natural
14:50
but in the spirit realm this is what the
14:52
father says
14:53
the wicked and evil trying to rule they
14:55
have no power
14:57
no true power so they have no right no
15:00
portals
15:00
open to them to allow evil to flood this
15:03
country like people think is happening
15:05
i'm sorry but the devil isn't going to
15:07
be taking over
15:08
because there's no true portal or
15:10
opening you have
15:12
for that to happen that is shut you
15:15
should be rejoicing everybody because
15:16
this is going to be an accelerated thing
15:18
that begins to happen
15:19
with the revival going into the
15:21
habitation of god in this
15:23
in this country and all over the world
15:25
actually so
15:26
these are celebrator times these are
15:29
victorious times
15:30
these are not times to be crushed and to
15:32
be sad and to have fear in you
15:34
about the only thing the devil's getting
15:36
away with is bringing fear
15:38
all those regulations and all those laws
15:40
being made illegal
15:42
illegitimately will not stand
15:45
yes well this is why you should be
15:47
celebrating because we will have the
15:49
ability
15:50
to move unhindered all open country
15:54
as god moves and does the victory thing
15:57
and you will see it with your eyes
15:59
everybody will see it with your eyes
16:00
this is why it's so important to come to
16:02
these events right now
16:03
to get filled up to get excited to begin
16:06
to make plans with god himself
16:08
about what your part will be in this so
16:10
this is a strategic event
16:12
you don't want to miss this this event
16:14
because this is god's time to bring in
16:16
that double
16:17
decade the divine decades uh
16:20
back to back in this in this country
16:22
here and it's going to be so powerful
16:24
your life won't be the same
16:26
we don't want it to go back exactly the
16:28
way it was we want it to be greater more
16:30
powerful in god
16:31
that we will be more accelerated forward
16:34
and the law will
16:35
flow in this country especially between
16:37
the body of crisis was really needed
16:39
first
16:40
and i declared that that love will be
16:41
released because the other
16:43
can't be hell can't be released right
16:45
now people
16:46
if you get me in the spirit room if you
16:48
were a or you would understand
16:50
it's leaving hell is leaving
16:53
and so that leaves those who want to be
16:55
in power
16:56
power less they won't have the effects
16:58
they won't have the enticement they
17:00
won't have that
17:01
uh the captivation of hell and evil
17:04
although it's already in them
17:05
it will not be released or lose
17:07
throughout this land because there's
17:08
been no portals
17:09
open because the one in true authority
17:12
is not allowing it
17:14
come on that's so good and of course the
17:17
wells are actually
17:18
portals because wells
17:21
one more thing there are these massive
17:24
angels some of the hosts have already
17:26
been sent to some of these wells
17:28
and they have these swords probably
17:30
they're 15 feet high swords
17:32
and they're like standing there like
17:33
this over them about to hit
17:35
them when we declare something at this
17:37
event they will hit
17:39
these wells these drywalls and they will
17:41
literally be open
17:42
and they'll shoot on springs so this is
17:45
a
17:45
specific event planned by god so this
17:48
can happen so don't miss being a part of
17:51
uh having those wells open can i share
17:55
something with you really quick uh
17:57
that's what i was seeing in the spirit
17:58
when i was beginning to pray and see you
18:00
coming over to this area
18:02
i saw you just taking a stake and
18:04
driving it
18:05
into the ground and it just broke open
18:09
this area and i saw the wells begin to
18:12
bubble up and the the
18:14
springs just begin to spring forth
18:17
throughout the earth
18:18
in this area and it just goes all the
18:20
way
18:21
from this side all the way down into the
18:24
east coast
18:25
and i just believe it's going to start
18:27
something here in this area
18:29
that has not been done before i'm so we
18:32
are so excited
18:36
well absolutely the convergence that
18:39
happens
18:40
when the right anointings and mantles
18:42
come together
18:43
and and times uh you do not receive a
18:46
breakthrough
18:47
because there's an element that's
18:49
missing but i believe
18:51
again us coming together especially with
18:53
miss cat especially with the now
18:55
anointing and the now word that she
18:56
carries
18:57
sun is gonna break open in the pacific
18:59
northwest
19:00
so listen people of god you need to be
19:03
there at this event i mean we're pretty
19:04
much sold out i don't know if
19:06
we can do overflow open up the doors and
19:09
have people just sitting outside we may
19:11
have to do that honestly
19:12
because we're already sold out uh but
19:14
you know there's going to be something
19:16
powerful that's going to be released
19:18
that's going to affect all the regions
19:21
of states nearby i guarantee it i
19:22
believe witches
19:24
are going to come to jesus yeah people
19:27
who are in
19:27
new age are going to be delivered okay
19:31
to warlocks weekends people
19:34
moving in the dark and black magic and
19:37
dark spirits they're they're going to
19:39
feel the tremors of the wealth opening
19:42
up so it's going to be powerful
19:44
um you know again as we're talking about
19:47
all this again what god is doing
19:49
in america right now on the earth what
19:51
god is doing from now
19:53
february all the way to april passover
19:56
and now specifically for this conference
19:57
this event
19:59
the washington glory invasion you know
20:02
i'm just reminded of
20:04
again uh uh john g
20:07
lake how he started up the healing
20:10
whales and the healing rooms in spokane
20:13
washington
20:14
and you know there's something
20:15
supernatural
20:17
that happens in the pacific northwest
20:19
and i believe something's going to break
20:21
with that mantle
20:22
now prophet shirelle is there something
20:24
you want to share with us concerning
20:26
john g
20:27
lake the healing rooms and that well of
20:29
revival
20:30
that's about to burst open i just
20:34
know that we are getting close we have
20:36
been seeing
20:37
more miracles than ever before
20:41
in our second service we had a man come
20:44
in and walk out of a wheelchair
20:46
i mean when taylor ran up to me and she
20:48
was like mom there's someone outside in
20:50
a wheelchair and i was going
20:52
oh my gosh not a wheelchair on my second
20:54
service
20:58
but it was incredible it's just
21:01
awesome to be pioneering here what has
21:04
been in god's heart for so long
21:07
and i just what i'm seeing is that this
21:10
explosion that's gonna happen
21:12
no man can keep his foot on it then the
21:16
holy spirit is getting ready to explode
21:18
in this area i believe we're going to
21:20
see miracles like never before
21:23
i believe we're going to see limbs
21:25
growing out
21:26
more blind eyes and deaf ears being
21:28
healed but not only that
21:30
families being healed god is calling
21:33
whole
21:34
families in this season he's calling the
21:36
prodigals
21:37
home and i'm so excited to see
21:41
and be a part of this movement and it's
21:44
like
21:44
god is strategically placing people
21:47
the right people together people that
21:50
probably
21:51
really never wanted to do anything like
21:53
this i don't know about you cat but i
21:55
was just minding my own business when
21:57
the fire of god
21:58
fell on me in my living room and he told
22:00
me to go live on facebook and i was like
22:03
you want me to do what
22:08
so i just believe that god
22:11
is raising up a remnant in this season
22:14
in this hour he's the people that he's
22:16
bringing to the hub here
22:18
are just so hungry and they're tired of
22:22
church
22:22
they're tired of religion they're tired
22:25
of being
22:26
put in a box i took the box slacks
22:29
last week and i ripped it in half and i
22:31
threw it
22:32
and i stomped on it during the circuit
22:36
because i just believe you know when
22:38
we're led by the holy spirit
22:41
it's powerful yes it is we give him the
22:44
platform
22:45
and he does it all it takes the pressure
22:47
off of us
22:48
and we just give him the reigns and we
22:50
say have your way holy spirit
22:53
and i believe that's people like john g
22:55
lakes that's what he did
22:56
he probably surrendered his life to the
22:59
holy spirit and that's why god
23:00
used him so mightily and that's what
23:03
we're seeing right now
23:04
and another thing is i feel like
23:08
you know um god's using the most
23:11
unlikely people
23:12
yeah and people that are not really that
23:16
well liked people don't like cats pink
23:19
hair
23:20
people don't like my pink lipstick
23:26
but i'm just being obedient to god and
23:29
just saying
23:30
use me lord i surrender my life to you
23:32
and
23:34
he's gonna he's gonna do something in
23:36
this area that we have not seen
23:38
we are getting ready to see something
23:41
that we have never
23:43
seen i mean what are the odds of the
23:46
kansas city chiefs
23:48
going to the super bowl for a second
23:50
time
23:51
yeah that's incredible well well
23:55
once again god god is the god of the
23:57
miraculous and he's the god of the
23:59
double and the triple
24:00
so i believe in the season just like
24:02
prophet shirelle said
24:03
that the unlikely the no names the
24:06
faceless
24:06
those that objected looked down upon i
24:09
mean president donald j
24:10
trump took took it by storm and he came
24:14
totally from
24:14
left uh from the left side from you know
24:17
left wing
24:18
but again it's those types of people
24:20
where there will be a supernatural grace
24:22
to be an apostolic chief like the kansas
24:25
city chiefs
24:26
god's raising of apostolic chiefs
24:28
prophetic warriors in the season
24:30
who carry the now word of god and who
24:32
walk in signs
24:34
and wonders yeah uh of course we're
24:37
talking about this event
24:38
uh you know we're all going to be
24:40
together literally in a few days
24:42
i know my cities
24:52
uh talk to us what are you expecting for
24:55
this
24:56
event it's really not even an event but
24:58
it's
24:59
it's a family celebration it is because
25:03
it's actually an encounter um yes god
25:06
doesn't always call things events
25:07
anymore he calls them encounters
25:09
and those who are there or who choose to
25:11
encounter what he's got
25:13
those are the ones who will go away with
25:15
it to use it to release it for him
25:18
but something else about john g lake um
25:22
i remember one time when i was i was
25:24
under attack that was probably maybe 12
25:26
14 years ago when all that happened and
25:29
i was heading to
25:30
memphis to um release elvis's mantle to
25:34
be completed because it wasn't completed
25:37
and then he bought me every way i could
25:39
that's how important mantles are they're
25:40
so important
25:42
and i i told my husband knows throw me
25:44
in the back of the
25:45
truck there was a double cab and
25:47
margaret drove all the way there and we
25:49
were listening to
25:50
um billy brims tapes about had all those
25:54
who had passed on before
25:56
she had recorded things and i think john
25:58
g
25:59
lake's son-in-law was speaking and he
26:01
was talking about
26:03
um speaking in tongues and i'm telling
26:06
you it started to get really hot
26:10
it was so hot and all of a sudden the
26:13
holy spirit said
26:14
i want you to claim it and so he was
26:16
speaking under the anointing of the
26:19
lightning power of god that was one of
26:20
the things john d like operated in
26:22
it just blasts the enemy out it's still
26:24
a part of the fire of god
26:26
and god said claim your healing and i
26:28
yelled i couldn't speak up until that
26:30
point it said i
26:30
i claim it and all of a sudden a fire
26:34
came through the speaker
26:35
hit me at the end of my feet when i went
26:37
my body and drove the sickness out
26:40
and i was instantly and i was on fire it
26:43
started getting so
26:44
hot in the cab and i know the holy
26:46
spirit was just laughing he was so
26:47
celebrating
26:48
see because i out of an act of obedience
26:51
i was just dared to do it
26:53
and when we got to the event when we got
26:55
to the this place
26:57
in memphis where i was speaking about
26:59
albus and why god called him and
27:00
anointed him
27:01
and was talking about that mantle then
27:03
people ran forward to get prayer
27:05
the holy spirit said impart the fire of
27:08
the lightning power of god into them i'm
27:10
like
27:10
when did i get that and he said you said
27:12
you received it and i said
27:14
i thought i received him and he said oh
27:16
you have the mantle
27:18
of the lightning power of god that john
27:19
g lake operated in and since
27:22
that day i have used that lightning
27:24
power god it destroys the works of
27:26
darkness no matter what is
27:28
about and i did it so much so many times
27:31
john g lake actually showed up
27:34
at my event
27:37
there you could see by several people
27:40
who were present
27:41
and he was just watching me release the
27:43
lightening power of god i can tell you
27:44
what's going to be the lighting power of
27:45
god is going to be at that event people
27:47
and it destroys the warts of darkness in
27:50
your life
27:51
in cities and regions and i mean no
27:54
guess what it's probably going to show
27:55
up there
27:56
probably john g lake that's where he's
27:58
from
27:59
and so expect the lightning power of god
28:01
expect the miraculous to happen and i do
28:04
expect things to happen that never
28:06
happened before so it's going to be a
28:08
power
28:09
a power encounter of god of holy spirit
28:13
of jesus
28:14
of this whole area being least
28:17
at least released into its destiny
28:20
to bring the life and the power of god
28:22
into this country and then throughout
28:24
the world so
28:25
this is a major encounter time
28:28
on god's timeline so please don't
28:31
miss being there because we are all a
28:33
part of this when we come into agreement
28:36
great power is released
28:39
wow that is so powerful that's why uh
28:41
you know as
28:42
myself and prophet shiro we prayed about
28:45
a title for this encounter
28:48
you know uh the washington glory
28:50
invasion because
28:51
the lightning angels of course the
28:54
thunders and lightnings from his throne
28:56
are actually angelic hosts that are
28:58
being released from his throne
29:00
okay those angels are going to be
29:02
invading and they're they're already
29:04
invading right now those angels are
29:05
going to be invading
29:07
this time and i believe right now even
29:09
from that
29:10
event conference region to wherever
29:13

29:15

29:20
mantles a new measure of healing don't
29:23
be afraid of kobe don't be afraid of

vaccinations don't be afraid of
29:27
what the world says there's a new wave
29:30
of
29:30
miracle working power and healing as
29:33
being
29:33

32:12

32:14
ben and i feel what you're feeling that
32:16
god is going to do some new things never
32:18
done before and it's going to be one of
32:20
those suddenlies
32:21
it is a suddenly and it will spring
32:23
forth and it will
32:24

32:31
i'm not just seeing a camera i see
32:33
people in the world
32:34
i see masses of people so
32:37
hungry drawing that anointing that is in
32:41
me i can feel actually
32:42
leaving me now even though this is a
32:44
like you know a recording
32:46
uh i just already know that god's gonna
32:48
do something powerful
32:49
and i love that god will start in some
32:51
of the most unexpected places because
32:54
that's just who he is
32:56
he'll use the things that have been
32:57
abandoned or overlooked or stopped or
33:00
delayed or halted
33:01
there will be no more delay in these
33:03
days no more delay
33:05

33:29
praise god amen any last word before we
33:33
just close our prayer today
33:35
as cat was just talking the lord
33:38
reminded me
33:39
of an encounter i had last month
33:42
i was down in my living room worshiping
33:44
on my knees and i had my eyes
33:46
closed and i could see the biggest
33:49
angel i've ever seen in the spirit
33:53
his wings were stretched from each side
33:56
of my living room and right at that
33:58
moment
33:59
it hit my spirit and i just knew that it
34:02
was the angel
34:03
of awakening and revival and
34:06
he said one thing to me he said
34:10
it is time
34:13
and as cat was speaking i just
34:16
kept hearing that over and over it is
34:19
time
34:20
it is the time and we are standing on
34:24
this
34:24
we are believing it and we are going to
34:28
see it come to fruition in this season
34:33
my gosh i just i just see and feel in a
34:36
spirit where there's such a strong
34:38
unity right now and where hands are
34:41
being held together in agreement yeah

34:46
agreement right now

the wonder of you inside of us i thank

you for the father
04:00
and everyone said amen
04:04
amen wow this is an awesome atmosphere
04:11
thank you for coming everyone
04:16
the only thing i like more about going
04:18
to heaven is sharing it
04:22
i can't teach you how to do that i have
04:24
a commission to do that i can tell you
04:25
that he is catching people up
04:27
all over this world and showing them his
04:30
home
04:34
for christ said in my father's house are
04:36
many mansions
04:38
and i can assure you that his house is
04:41
not a building
04:44
it's not a platform somewhere in the sky
04:47
it is a world bigger than our galaxy
04:53
even bigger than that there's no way you
04:56
can measure it
04:57
or even understand how he designed it
05:01
it's always been his home until the day
05:04
he makes the new earth and then we all
05:05
have a home together
05:09
i don't know if you realize this is
05:10
actually willing to leave his own home
05:13
to live with us christ had to leave it
05:16
when he became down to earth and he
05:18
became flesh had flesh put him he died
05:20
on the cross
05:21
the holy spirit moved his base of
05:22
operations here because christ
05:25
sent him here and then one day the
05:28
father himself
05:29
will leave heaven and forever live on
05:31
the new earth with all of us
05:33
in that amazing that they had to be
05:36
willing to do all of that for us
05:39
that's because he loves you that's
05:42
because you actually came from him
05:44
everyone who ever existed came from him
05:48
you didn't live somewhere in heaven you
05:49
lived in him
05:51
he was your very world the enemy
05:55
is always trying to copycat what god has
05:58
he wants to be god that's never going to
06:00
happen
06:03
it didn't happen back in the ancient
06:05
times when he was thrown out of heaven
06:07
when he was so convinced he convinced
06:10
himself
06:11
he had won he got a third of the angels
06:14
on his side which still is almost it
06:16
makes you
06:17
undone to think about that doesn't it
06:20
they lived
06:21
with the god who made them and yet they
06:23
chose a creation
06:26
over the creator
06:31
and let me tell you just because god
06:33
didn't say anything to him didn't mean
06:34
that he didn't know about it
06:38
but the more he deceived and the more
06:41
god remained silent
06:42
he thought that he had won he thought he
06:45
was smarter than god
06:46
and then he found out in a second
06:50
he wasn't anything
06:54
he wasn't anything he was kicked out of
06:56
heaven all the angels were kicked out
06:58
with him
06:59
they can never be restored
07:02
and i know you may hear people preach
07:04
that one day god will forgive everybody
07:06
that everyone will go to heaven he'll
07:09
forgive lucifer he'll forgive the fallen
07:11
angels that will not ever happen
07:14
their future is already sealed in the
07:16
lake of fire
07:18
they will not be anywhere near us on the
07:20
new earth
07:23
it says the former things will be
07:24
remembered no more
07:27
in heaven right now though you give
07:28
testimony of your life
07:31
and the victory that god gave you on
07:32
this earth when you get to heaven
07:34
but one day none of the things that that
07:37
were a part of your life
07:38
are without him well you will not even
07:40
be able to remember them
07:43
but i will tell you right now even on
07:44
this earth we will become
07:46
so supernatural like him
07:50
let's say this together god said
07:54
let us make man in our image
07:59
and after our likeness and let them have
08:02
dominion
08:04
over the earth that's his plan for you
08:10
so people say that we can't be like him
08:12
they're wrong
08:14
he would have never said that and in
08:16
case you didn't know
08:18
after the likeness is the way they
08:20
operate
08:22
so he didn't just make you in his image
08:23
he gave you things inside of you
08:26
so that you could operate like him
08:29
so who is he he's a creator right
08:32
jesus christ is a commander is that
08:34
right
08:35
holy spirit goes every knows everything
08:37
all at the same time
08:39
holy spirit is an unlimited layered
08:41
being
08:44
don't you like revelation
08:48
he has unlimited layers of himself and
08:51
every layer of him
08:52
is a whole of him so wherever he sends a
08:56
layer of himself
08:57
he knows everything everywhere
09:01
all at the same time so for your
09:04
information
09:05
when you invite holy spirit to indwell
09:07
you
09:08
you don't get a little piece of him
09:11
he sends a layer of himself which is a
09:13
whole of him
09:15
who indwells you and that is what makes
09:17
you the temple of the holy spirit
09:22
that is one of the most important things
09:24
you can do after you get born again
09:25
it's not even preached in some places
09:27
right now you know because the enemy is
09:29
terrified of that happening to you
09:32
because then instead of walking beside
09:34
you
09:35
it says the word when you get born again
09:36
he comes alongside you is that right
09:40
and he'll be there all the time until
09:43
you're caught up to heaven one day
09:44
unless you do something about it
09:47
unless you choose to ask him to indwell
09:50
you you have to invite him
09:53
say we must invite say we had to invite
09:57
christ
09:59
to indwell us we have to invite holy
10:02
spirit
10:03
to indwell us it's heaven protocol
10:09
and the reason for that is you had to
10:10
make a choice
10:12
you chose with your will to receive
10:15
christ
10:16
and let me tell you we actually have a
10:18
new cd card born again that the father
10:20
had me just make
10:22
it tells you what happened in the spirit
10:24
realm what happened in eternity
10:27
in the scrolls of time and the lamb's
10:29
book of life
10:30
in hell and inside your very being
10:34
that made you the new creation what
10:36
happened at that time
10:37
at that moment in time and it's on this
10:40
cd called born again
10:42
it's one of the best witnessing tools
10:44
i've ever had or ever made
10:46
it explains why christ why do you have
10:49
to receive him
10:50
what happens when you receive him what
10:52
levels you can go after after that
10:54
happens
10:55
what happens when holy spirit indwells
10:57
you what happens all around you
10:59
what happens with the host of heaven
11:01
what happens with your guardian angel
11:03
this if you're not aware of the spirit
11:05
realm the unseen realm i'm talking about
11:08
the unseen realm
11:10
it says everything that was made that
11:12
you see was made by that which was
11:14
unseen
11:16
that means the unseen realm is the
11:18
original realm
11:20
not this physical realm this physical
11:24
realm is temporal
11:25
it's temporary that's what that means
11:28
but eternity is in this in the spirit
11:31
realm
11:32
there's more activity in the spirit
11:34
realm than there is in the scene realm
11:39
there's it never stops activity never
11:41
stops in the unseen realm not around you
11:44
not around where you live not in the
11:46
atmosphere
11:47
not into the third heavens there's
11:49
continual activity
11:51
both from heaven and from hell
11:55
and what you do in your life will draw
11:57
one or the other to you
12:00
that's why you need discernment that's
12:02
why you need holy spirit
12:03
that's why you need to pursue an
12:05
intimate relationship with jesus christ
12:08
there's a lot of stuff going on in this
12:10
world today even in the body of christ
12:13
that shouldn't be happening there's a
12:15
lot of good and there's a lot of god
12:17
i'm not going to discount that because
12:20
god is pouring himself
12:21
more and more into this world christ is
12:24
making himself
12:25
known to us every day of our life you
12:27
can increase
12:28
in that relationship with him because he
12:30
wants that kind of relationship with you
12:34
he's not sitting on the sideline
12:35
watching your life go by
12:38
no he armed us when you were born again
12:42
you got
12:42
weapons you got the anointing
12:46
you got authority given to you because
12:48
you
12:49
you are now a son of the living god your
12:51
son or daughter of the living god
12:54
and what you do with your life after you
12:56
receive him is totally up to you
13:00
but right now living on this earth are
13:03
many that he called to demonstrate for
13:05
him
13:07
in the greater works that christ talked
13:09
about
13:10
they're beyond your imagination
13:14
to even consider or think you might
13:16
actually get to do some of that
13:19
like going to a funeral and raising
13:21
someone the dead that was cremated
13:24
[Music]
13:27
i hope i got someone's attention
13:31
everybody say that's a greater work
13:36
people think well you know lazarus was
13:38
dead for four days correct
13:41
that's in the scriptures he was dead he
13:44
was stinking his body was stinking
13:47
mary and martha we're trying to show
13:49
christ it is too late let me tell you
13:51
christ did not cry because lazarus died
13:56
he said it was going to be okay didn't
13:58
he yeah
14:00
because he knew who he was you know he
14:02
cried because they didn't believe it
14:06
they were doubting him he had said yeah
14:09
he'll be resurrected yes we know on the
14:12
day that the dead in christ is raised
14:13
he'll be raising who's trying to say no
14:15
right now
14:17
you know he was there right he knew what
14:20
was going to happen let me tell you
14:22
people in abraham's bosom were shocked
14:27
do we ever think of that how many people
14:30
don't know what abraham's bosom was let
14:32
me see your hand
14:33
it's okay if you don't know a lot of
14:35
places don't teach that anymore
14:37
before christ died on the cross and
14:40
descended into hell and wiped up hell
14:42
went up to heaven and poured out his
14:44
blood on the mercy seat when people when
14:46
righteous people died that god called
14:48
righteous they descended
14:50
into abraham's bosom which was a
14:51
spiritual abode
14:53
god made for his friends they didn't sit
14:57
on rocks
14:58
it was a spirit round place it had
15:00
golden buildings it had a sky
15:02
it had a magnificent river it had king's
15:05
tables filled with feasts
15:08
for them to partake of and below that
15:11
was hell
15:13
and there was a great gulf between them
15:15
this is what the word says
15:16
and those in hell right inside the gates
15:18
of hell you come up to the courtyard of
15:20
hell
15:21
you could see up into abraham's bosom
15:24
but you couldn't go there
15:26
they could see them if they came close
15:27
to there was like um
15:29
i'm trying to think of the word my
15:31
mind's not in the natural realm at all
15:32
right now
15:34
i like a balcony reigning thank you holy
15:36
spirit
15:38
in this beautiful place he'd made for
15:40
abraham
15:41
isaac jacob joseph who raised jesus
15:44
right john the baptist was there is that
15:47
true
15:48
yes because they were righteous they
15:49
were kind of righteous either because
15:51
they believed in god himself
15:53
and they extended their faith for that
15:55
when they died they went there they
15:57
didn't they didn't descend into hell
15:58
that was for the wicked dad
16:01
but they could see each other at one
16:03
point
16:05
and so people in abraham's bosom already
16:08
knew the messiah
16:10
was on the earth as soon as joseph went
16:13
there
16:14
they knew because he wouldn't stop
16:17
talking about it
16:18
if you knew that and you went there
16:20
would you talk about it
16:25
yeah he nonstop talked about it and then
16:29
when john the baptist went who was his
16:31
cousin
16:33
he confirmed everything joseph said but
16:35
he even knew more
16:37
because he was there after joseph he was
16:39
still there living on the earth after
16:41
joseph went
16:42
and descended abraham's wisdom so then
16:44
john the baptist was talking about him
16:46
he actually saw him right he baptized
16:49
him
16:50
he wouldn't stop talking i have baptized
16:52
the messiah
16:54
he is here on the earth he's here
16:57
so they already knew in abraham's wisdom
16:59
the messiah was on the earth so let me
17:00
tell you when he showed up there
17:02
they knew who he was and he proved who
17:06
he was
17:07
because he himself left for the first
17:10
time left abraham's bosom
17:12
and crossed over into hell on his own
17:15
because he had an assignment
17:18
it was to take back our authority
17:22
and our dominion that god had given
17:25
you know had given adam and eve and then
17:26
they they sold out but you know what
17:28
they were redeemed yes they're in heaven
17:30
say yay
17:33
adam and eve are in heaven how about
17:35
that
17:37
they made it
17:41
so sometimes you don't really think
17:43
about the whole scope of this picture
17:47
and so as someone else came to abraham's
17:50
bosom
17:50
they would tell them what was going on
17:52
on the earth because they were new the
17:54
new arrivals
17:55
and it's just like in heaven when
17:57
somebody newly arrives they'll chase you
17:58
down
18:00
they'll start getting you the minute you
18:02
come in the gate and you're standing
18:03
trying to jump in the river
18:04
they're like okay what about this
18:07
whatever this is i heard this was going
18:08
on what about this
18:09
is this true now i saw something from
18:11
the portal but i didn't know all about
18:13
so why don't you why don't we go share
18:14
somewhere
18:15
they want to haul you off somewhere and
18:16
share with you they want to hear what i
18:18
want to hear what you have to say and
18:19
later you're going to have meetings
18:22
every one of your family members had to
18:24
stand on a platform and
18:26
share to the body of christ living in
18:28
heaven about their life
18:30
how god redeemed them what was going on
18:32
around them and then what was newly
18:34
invented on the earth they won every
18:35
time somebody new comes they want to
18:37
know
18:38
i promise you it was exact same in
18:40
abraham's bosom
18:42
okay you don't get a chance to do that
18:43
when you go to hell okay
18:45
you have no life in hell been there and
18:49
seen it
18:50
you don't want to go there there's
18:53
people right now saying there is no help
18:56
they may find out one day
19:00
there are there definitely is it talks
19:02
about it in the word it exists it's
19:04
there
19:06
but in abraham's bosom life was amazing
19:08
it was beautiful
19:11
they had feasts to eat you don't get
19:13
anything in hell
19:14
there will be no food in hell
19:18
i love that one song that says they
19:20
don't see they don't serve breakfast in
19:22
hell
19:26
if you haven't heard it i think
19:30
isn't it uh it's called like my father's
19:32
house isn't that the name of the song
19:35
but yeah big big house is big big house
19:38
and they are telling people you won't
19:39
get breakfast in hell
19:42
you don't
19:45
but abraham's bosom had more than enough
19:48
and plenty they needed
19:50
to enjoy their life they were always
19:51
excited when somebody knew came there
19:54
and most of the time they didn't have to
19:55
ask them they came there talking about
19:57
it
19:58
especially once the son of god and the
20:00
messiah was on the earth
20:01
that was the number one subject they
20:02
wanted to know about
20:04
i know i was taken there i saw abraham's
20:06
bosom
20:07
it wasn't some little tiny hovel on a
20:09
rock people picture them sitting in the
20:11
middle of the earth you know trying to
20:12
escape the lava
20:14
the spirit realm supersedes this
20:17
physical realm
20:18
that's why spiritual beings can pass
20:21
through the walls they can walk through
20:22
you your angel stands in you most of the
20:24
time
20:27
yeah they sit on you too sometimes
20:30
especially if you ever get out on the
20:33
floor
20:34
if you're knocked out by the spirit of
20:36
god or the glory whatever it is that
20:37
gets you on that floor and you can't
20:39
move
20:39
your angel is sitting on you
20:44
you can't even crawl i've been there i'd
20:47
see them sit on me
20:48
and they wouldn't get up and all i could
20:51
do was laugh i mean i couldn't crawl
20:53
like tell my family don't bother me
20:54
until i can crawl up to the you know
20:56
alter
20:57
leave me there
21:00
you'll find out one day everything they
21:02
did okay for you and to you
21:08
but there was big news in abraham's
21:10
bosom
21:11
about the messiah once
21:14
lazarus came he was
21:17
dead for four days where do you think he
21:19
was
21:21
he was the newest thing in abraham's
21:23
bosom
21:24
and that man who was one of christ's
21:26
best friends
21:27
knew beyonce who he was he would not
21:30
stop talking about the messiah
21:32
and here he is like into his starting
21:34
his fourth day there
21:35
just going full steam ahead wham
21:40
[Applause]
21:42
they lost their messenger
21:46
they heard a voice
21:47
[Music]
21:50
lazarus heard him he heard him calling
21:53
him from there
21:54
did you think he was going to say no i'm
21:55
busy
21:57
later when i'm done oh he did not care
22:00
okay
22:02
he called him to come forth he came out
22:04
of abraham his spiritual body came at
22:05
abraham's bosom
22:07
back into the tomb picked up his body
22:10
and he came out of that tomb still in
22:12
the wrappings
22:14
and he wasn't stinking
22:16
[Laughter]
22:18
because he was fresh alive
22:21
by the glory of god raised up from the
22:23
dead to be
22:25
a miraculous demonstration of the power
22:28
of
22:29
jesus christ which has been given to you
22:33
and i
22:35
you should see it that way we are joint
22:38
heirs with him
22:40
what he did on this earth we have the
22:42
ability if we walk in
22:43
and go after it to do that he said
22:47
that we have the ability to raise the
22:49
dead right heal the sick raise the dead
22:51
cast
22:51
out demons is that right
22:56
trump is supposed to you're right you're
22:57
supposed to follow us
22:59
if you believe you got to remember that
23:02
there are requirements
23:05
to all those who believe right these
23:08
shot
23:08
these signs shall follow them
23:14
and so here was christ demonstrating it
23:16
doesn't matter how long it doesn't
23:17
matter if your dad
23:18
you don't have you know no matter if you
23:19
died right then raise him up no he was
23:21
dead for
23:22
four days so if we're gonna do greater
23:24
works that means it has to be something
23:26
greater than being dead for four days
23:29
but he didn't mean being dead for seven
23:31
days he meant
23:32
when you were ashes
23:36
i i was taken forward in time and i
23:39
literally was shown this is one of the
23:40
greater works
23:42
and christ took me there and i saw
23:44
somebody raising someone from the dead
23:46
at a funeral that had been cremated
23:52
and everyone in the funeral home ran
23:54
down front through their face on the
23:56
floor
23:56
and began to cry out to jesus christ
23:59
[Music]
24:01
and i i am absolutely
24:06
what he shows me is literal he doesn't
24:09
show me symbolic things ever
24:11
he treats me like i may he says i'm
24:13
going to show you so you know what i'm
24:14
talking about that is something that
24:17
will happen
24:18
i'm sure it will go viral around the
24:20
earth
24:23
so the knowledge of the glory sometimes
24:26
will go through the internet
24:28
[Music]
24:30
did you think about that
24:34
that's something worth watching over a
24:36
few times isn't it
24:40
people watch laughing dogs 10 million
24:44
times
24:47
and i want to point out no matter what
24:49
tragedies and stuff are going on out
24:51
there
24:52
the laughing dogs top all the doom and
24:56
gloom and the wicked evil stop
24:59
because people want something that
25:00
they're going to enjoy
25:02
so why don't you give them something to
25:04
enjoy
25:07
your testimony should be filled with
25:08
glory power
25:10
right victory that's the word of your
25:13
testimony you overcome with that that's
25:15
not the story of your doom and gloom and
25:17
and 10 hours of your sufferings
25:20
that's a story a testimony
25:25
is how you were tested and you got
25:27
victory
25:28
and christ gets all the glory for it
25:32
he actually told me to tell you if
25:34
you're writing a book about your life
25:35
make sure he gets more than 10 pages
25:39
because it won't be worth reading if you
25:42
make people
25:43
suffer along with you through your
25:46
entire life
25:47
and at the end you give an ounce of
25:49
victory that doesn't show them that they
25:51
can overcome
25:53
even during the in the midst of what
25:55
they're going through
25:56
you should have victory every day of
25:58
your life because he delivers us
26:00
out of it all right
26:04
so start giving him the victory the
26:05
minute you step into something
26:07
start declaring you have victory you're
26:09
giving him the glory it's because of him
26:11
not you
26:12
that you are an overcomer because your
26:15
words have power
26:18
if you don't remember anything else
26:20
remember to watch your words
26:23
what do you want in your life what do
26:26
you want in your family's life
26:27
what do you want right now in your life
26:30
because what you say
26:31
is what you're going to get the word
26:35
says you'll eat the fruit of your lips
26:37
is that right whatsoever you will have
26:40
whatsoever you
26:42
say it loud you should have whatsoever
26:44
you
26:46
i think that means your words are
26:47
important
26:49
he made me count my words one time
26:53
every time i opened my mouth i had to
26:55
think about what i was going to say he
26:56
trained me to speak life
26:58
and not negative not negative
27:02
unless he shows me something that he has
27:05
said i am to be aware of
27:07
and to not be a part of i don't run
27:09
around
27:10
spending my life critiquing everybody
27:12
else's life and pointing out all their
27:14
weaknesses
27:16
because you're not helping them when you
27:17
do that
27:19
you're not you need to talk about
27:21
people's strengths
27:23
their gifts right god's plans for them
27:26
share the truth with them while you're
27:28
doing it because they're going to open
27:30
they're going to be open for you to
27:31
speak to them if you're encouraging them
27:34
not blasting them and i also know that
27:37
you help the enemy when you blast them
27:40
it's like you're part of the enemy's
27:41
camp
27:43
this is my assignment to tell them how
27:45
wicked and evil they are
27:46
how far they have fallen from god that
27:48
they're walking in hopelessness they'll
27:50
never have anything
27:51
no that is the enemy's words
27:54
that's how he talks if you hear that
27:56
don't say it
27:57
if you hear those words turn around go i
27:59
know who you are and i'll have nothing
28:01
to do with you
28:03
you'll freak him out because most people
28:06
just say what he says
28:08
right so if we're going to be like
28:12
christ in the earth we have to be
28:13
careful what we say
28:15
how we live the choices that we make
28:19
in our life your soul is fed every
28:21
minute of the day
28:23
by what you say what people say to you
28:25
what you watch what you hear
28:27
and places you go your soul is going to
28:29
be
28:30
whatever this is the way god said
28:32
whatever you enter into
28:33
is going to enter into you that's a
28:36
quote
28:38
a quote from heaven what you enter into
28:41
will enter into you that means in your
28:44
soul
28:46
and that's important because you are a
28:48
living soul
28:50
we've all said you know we have we you
28:52
know we we we we're a body
28:55
we are a spirit we have a soul no you
28:57
are a soul
28:59
you are a soul wrapped in your spirit
29:01
man
29:02
and you have flesh on your body so you
29:03
can have dominion in the earth
29:06
but you are a soul and you choose
29:09
whether it prospers or not
29:12
if you want to prosper and be in health
29:14
then you guard what goes in your soul
29:18
you can change the way you think the way
29:20
you respond even what happens to you
29:22
tomorrow
29:24
by what you decide tonight to do with
29:26
your soul you can't take your soul and
29:28
set it on a shelf and pretend like it's
29:30
something bad
29:31
because when i grew up in in
29:33
denominational churches they always said
29:35
the soulless realm is bad your soul is
29:37
bad
29:39
well then how come it got saved
29:41
[Laughter]
29:43
i was eight and i would have all these
29:45
big questions for people
29:47
that they didn't want to answer if my
29:50
soul
29:51
just got saved right he came to save
29:55
souls right if i gave it to jesus and he
29:58
moved in
29:59
then why is my soul bad
30:02
i don't think anything bad i'm not
30:04
looking at bad stuff i mean just only
30:06
eight years old
30:07
but they made decisions when i was young
30:09
i was going to be in the side of my
30:10
parents
30:11
i was going to be on god's side you know
30:14
i was going to help him
30:15
he needed help
30:18
so i really consider what i do with my
30:20
life even when i was young
30:22
i did so i escaped even though i was
30:25
raised as a teenager and the whole drug
30:27
thing when it first came out by by the
30:28
way marijuana is bad
30:39
no matter what they tell you that's from
30:42
heaven
30:44
he did not make it so you could smoke it
30:48
i don't care if it is a natural plant
30:53
i will preach it i grew up in that time
30:55
when it first came
30:56
well in my era when it first came
31:00
people lost jobs they lost friendships
31:04
they got sucked into lsd and all the
31:06
other drugs
31:08
i didn't do any of it i decided at 15 i
31:11
was having nothing to do with it and i
31:13
wasn't participating
31:14
so i still have all my brain
31:19
i'm in great help because i never
31:21
participated in the drug thing
31:24
i didn't need anybody else's approval
31:27
i wasn't part of a clique i didn't know
31:29
that peer pressure bothered me actually
31:31
i tried to talk
31:32
all my friends in high school well my
31:34
acquaintances i didn't have a lot of
31:35
friends i had i had a tribe at home
31:38
i would tell them i'll look right um i
31:39
said you're nuts for taking this stuff
31:41
you're gonna burn your brain cells up
31:43
you know what are you gonna become you
31:45
can't even think right
31:48
and people got i think i think 60 out of
31:50
600 seniors uh od'd in my senior class
31:54
off from drugs and all of them started
31:58
on
31:58
marijuana every single one of them
32:02
they actually give it to you free
32:06
they give it to you free get you hooked
32:08
up then they bring something stronger to
32:09
you
32:10
that's how it works i was in the
32:13
elevator in the hotel and i heard a
32:14
young man
32:16
he had come here on business to meet
32:18
with some business people here
32:20
and he was saying on the phone not
32:22
knowing who i was
32:24
we blasted him with the anointing the
32:25
whole time was there when he left
32:27
he said oh yeah i had a great time my
32:28
business meeting were very productive
32:30
and he said
32:31
these people were they were real real
32:32
with me we drank and we smoked some
32:36
i knew what he meant okay he didn't need
32:39
it for medicinal purposes
32:42
but these were leaders in a business
32:44
community
32:45
that gave it to this young man
32:48
that's not even ethical it's not
32:51
right he hadn't even had it before but
32:56
that's the enemy's plan
32:59
and he was saying man this was an
33:00
amazing experience in my mind i'm
33:02
thinking devil you are
33:03
not getting that person man i was
33:05
standing right now releasing the
33:07
anointing him he walked out the door we
33:08
sent the host of heaven upon all the
33:09
strongholds of the demonic
33:11
the addictive demonic to pull that
33:13
stronghold off of him and
33:14
pull it off of him and we were sending
33:16
on the glory after him the anointing
33:18
after him to break the yoke of darkness
33:19
off of him
33:20
and went god i am not tolerating this
33:23
i'm not tolerating it
33:28
and people well jesus didn't he said he
33:29
talked about any kind of pharmacia
33:33
that was drugs even back in his day they
33:35
had them
33:37
he talked about necromancers have
33:39
nothing to do with the necromancer
33:41
that is witchcraft
33:45
there's no good witches
33:48
and there's people that really think
33:49
there are there are no
33:52
good witches warlocks
33:56
wizards magicians
34:01
there was not one magician in the bible
34:02
that was good
34:05
and we're sitting here we've been so
34:07
consumed with society
34:09
and the world itself that we've accepted
34:11
a lot of stuff
34:12
but let me tell you he never accepted it
34:17
so we need to take a good long look at
34:18
ourself and say where am i
34:21
where am i and what god has called me to
34:23
be what he
34:24
what he showed me i am what christ gave
34:26
me how did he walk what did he do
34:29
we had braces forever what would jesus
34:31
do
34:33
not a lot of what goes on now
34:37
because if we're witnesses our life's
34:40
supposed to be a witness
34:41
right you didn't know you were going to
34:43
come to church tonight
34:46
because i'm saving the good stuff for
34:47
next
34:49
all those in abraham's bosom they lived
34:52
a righteous life according to
34:54
receiving god okay they believed who he
34:58
was they believed when he spoke they
34:59
believed they followed him and what he
35:01
said
35:02
and so they were kind of righteous so
35:03
they were they descended in abraham's
35:05
bosom
35:06
but the minute lazarus showed up they
35:08
knew something
35:09
was going to happen on the earth
35:12
not just to them they knew somebody
35:14
changed for them because their messiah
35:17
had come
35:18
they knew it they knew something would
35:20
be manifested in the earth and it
35:22
certainly was
35:23
maybe not what they expected but let me
35:26
tell you when christ himself
35:28
showed up a little while later with the
35:31
thief from the cross
35:33
because when christ gave up his spirit
35:37
he'd still be hanging there by the way
35:40
he didn't no one killed him he laid down
35:41
his life he actually had to make his
35:43
spirit man
35:44
leave his body he himself loosed it from
35:47
his body
35:49
yeah that's going to be in a movie one
35:51
day and then you will see in the movie
35:54
christ descending into abraham's bosom
35:56
him sharing the good news with them all
35:58
receiving him as christ as their savior
36:02
and let me tell you when the spear men
36:05
entered into that ground there was such
36:06
an upheaval
36:07
that they themselves walked on the earth
36:10
that were in abraham's bosom
36:12
go read the scripture
36:17
they were seen walking on the earth is
36:19
that crazy
36:20
you'd think they'd get a hint right okay
36:23
uh
36:24
that one's from a hundred years ago 300
36:26
years ago
36:27
he's walking on here something's going
36:29
on down there
36:30
[Music]
36:33
and christ wasn't numb because then he
36:34
was going to go wreck hal
36:39
my favorite one of my favorite times was
36:40
when they took me
36:42
when they took me down into hell and i
36:45
was there on the third day
36:46
when christ wasted them
36:48
[Music]
36:52
it will be in a movie
36:55
[Laughter]
36:57
[Applause]
37:02
not even a world-class movie a
37:04
heaven-class movie
37:06
that will be produced on this earth by
37:09
the best of the best with the best
37:11
special effects
37:12
that will get people undone everywhere
37:16
and they'll know what happened there's
37:18
actually a demand in hollywood they want
37:20
to know what happened between the cross
37:23
and when he when he went back to heaven
37:26
they want to know they want to know what
37:30
happened
37:30
[Music]
37:32
now when he went back when when his
37:33
disciples saw him ascending into heaven
37:35
he'd already been
37:36
there did you know that
37:40
because when he came out of the grave
37:41
what did he tell mary
37:43
i must go to my
37:45
[Music]
37:46
my father and your father right yeah
37:49
because he had to pour out his blood on
37:51
the mercy seat in heaven
37:54
so when he said it was finished on the
37:55
cross that meant that every
37:57
a sacrifice for all sin for all time
38:01
was once and for all never again would
38:03
something have to be sacrificed for sin
38:05
you would never again go to the temple
38:07
once a year to get forgiven did you know
38:09
that
38:10
they went once a year to get forgiven
38:12
okay then they tried to do their best
38:14
all year they go back again
38:16
and then heavenly sacrifices they had
38:18
this whole thing that god had shown them
38:20
to do
38:21
and then uh there's all kinds of things
38:23
you need to go back and read it
38:24
anyway that's the way you got forgiven
38:26
that's what that's what freaked out all
38:28
the high priest
38:29
when john the baptist started saying you
38:31
know repent of your sins the kingdom of
38:32
heaven is at hand
38:34
well they never heard that before that's
38:37
why they didn't like him
38:39
so when new revelation comes to the
38:41
earth there's always
38:43
upheaval and you're hearing the new
38:47
what is the new that means new things
38:49
will happen new ways will happen
38:51
new words will happen you're living in a
38:53
time like that right now
38:56
yeah because we'll be ruling and
38:57
reigning with christ
38:59
this is a whole new time that was a new
39:02
time a fullness of time has come that
39:04
was the fullness of time
39:07
so christ was wreaking heaven on the
39:09
earth before he ever went into hell then
39:10
he really wiped up
39:13
because hell thought they thought they
39:14
had won
39:18
the second time satan had a brain freeze
39:26
honestly he did the father said he lost
39:29
something in his mind when he fell
39:34
yeah part of his memory banks
39:37
because he still thinks even now he's
39:39
going to win
39:41
he's already been defeated well he was
39:42
he's totally defeated but i mean god
39:44
kicked him out of heaven he didn't win
39:46
them when he was going to take over
39:47
and go inside the father and rule from
39:49
inside the father
39:51
and be over all the people the people
39:53
weren't on the earth yet that was us
39:54
inside god
39:57
he knew we were in there
40:00
isn't that interesting he knew about us
40:04
for a very long time
40:06
he didn't know who we were he knew we
40:08
were important
40:09
he knew we weren't angels because god
40:12
didn't just speak and make us
40:14
we lived in him forever until he made
40:16
this earth time space
40:18
plan to send us here and when he made
40:20
adam's body
40:22
when the word made adam's body and the
40:24
father leaned over and breathed adam's
40:26
spiritual being
40:27
his spirit of life into his nostrils and
40:29
he became a living soul
40:31
uh the enemy was right there watching
40:34
because he was thrown on the earth
40:35
remember yeah he was watching he knew
40:37
where that came from
40:38
he knew that was somebody that came from
40:41
inside god and then he was
40:42
not well one way he wasn't happy because
40:44
now god was sending them
40:46
which would mean a lot of trouble for
40:48
him if they ever found out who they were
40:52
so god had a plan when he sent us people
40:56
it was to be like him on the earth to
40:59
take authority over all the power of the
41:01
enemy crush him push him back
41:04
take our rightful place that christ won
41:07
for us
41:08
he died for your sins but he went into
41:10
hell to get back your authority
41:12
that adam had given away because he was
41:15
righteous and they had no right to hold
41:16
him
41:18
so abraham's bosom was ready to see a
41:20
show
41:22
and hell was ready to put on a show but
41:25
there's only one person who put a show
41:26
on and made a show of it openly
41:30
and that was the son of the living god
41:34
[Applause]
41:38
if you if you don't think they like a
41:39
show up there you don't know them
41:42
because god put on a show
41:46
wasn't that a show when he sent
41:47
lightning bolts from himself and took
41:49
satan out right
41:51
and then one-third of the angels were
41:52
all kicked out the same way
41:55
they were celebrating in heaven because
41:57
they had had it up to here
41:59
with lucifer i don't know anyone in
42:02
heaven that cried when he was kicked out
42:05
the gabriel did not cry and michael
42:08
certainly
42:09
did not cry because from that moment on
42:11
he knew who the enemy was
42:13
because before that happened there was
42:15
no enemy
42:17
heaven was a delightful place it was a
42:20
wonderful place it was perfect in every
42:22
way
42:23
even lucifer was perfect in all his ways
42:25
until iniquity was found in him
42:28
and that was that he was greater than
42:29
god and he was going to take over
42:33
that didn't happen either so he was
42:36
kicked down to earth and decided well
42:38
i'm just going to take over here
42:40
on this nice place i'll just take over
42:42
here let me tell you what happened when
42:44
he first made those plans that didn't
42:45
work either
42:46
because then god brought the ice age and
42:48
he was sitting on a block of ice
42:52
you got to picture this this
42:58
is reality movie from heaven
43:02
when he was first cast out of heaven the
43:05
dinosaurs were on the earth
43:07
there was there was no sin on the earth
43:09
there was no darkness on this there's no
43:10
evil on the earth okay he brought that
43:12
with him
43:13
he began to make it a wilderness the
43:15
dinosaurs began to kill each other
43:16
because in the beginning they didn't i
43:18
saw him
43:18
i saw the earth when he made it the
43:20
first time
43:22
the dinosaurs walked with the watcher
43:25
angels
43:26
they left footprints the angels
43:29
in the ground and scientists are still
43:32
trying to figure out how they can make
43:33
it into cavemen
43:35
because they have blocks of like stone
43:38
with a put
43:39
a human footprint they think and
43:41
dinosaur prince
43:43
god put water angels on the earth to
43:45
care for them
43:47
watch your angels yeah they had flesh on
43:50
them
43:53
this is a reality movie this is reality
43:55
movie night
44:00
and they were here to care for the
44:01
dinosaurs
44:04
and god said well i'm not tolerating
44:05
this anymore you know he's going to take
44:07
over the earth
44:08
so god broke the water vapor shield that
44:09
covered the earth to put mist on the
44:11
ground so the dinosaur skin wouldn't
44:12
fall off
44:14
there had been no storms on the earth at
44:16
one point until of course
44:18
they heard cracks of lightning and then
44:19
here comes all the other stuff on the
44:21
earth
44:22
he began to make it a wilderness god
44:23
wasn't going to tolerate it
44:25
so the water vapor shield he put around
44:27
the earth which every one of your family
44:29
members has already seen this in heaven
44:31
you go into this place called creation
44:33
lab and god recorded all of it you get
44:35
to actually see how he made the heavens
44:36
and the earth
44:38
they know how all of it happened isn't
44:41
that amazing
44:44
so everybody gets to find that out they
44:46
know a whole lot up there
44:50
and so yeah so god broke the water of
44:51
april shield it flooded the earth until
44:53
he covered the whole earth
44:54
and then he blew on it and froze it and
44:56
there is satan with all of his plans
44:58
washed down the tubes again
44:59
because now he's got a block of ice and
45:01
he can do nothing on it
45:03
and there's the ice age
45:07
somebody didn't enjoy it
45:11
god removed his glory off the earth and
45:12
it said darkness covered the earth
45:15
and then we have verse two
45:19
[Music]
45:21
that was all in verse one then comes
45:25
verse two
45:26
and darkness was on the face of the deep
45:29
right
45:29
the spirit of god was hovering over the
45:31
waters is that correct over the waters
45:33
he didn't say there was ground
45:34
over the waters because in the beginning
45:37
he made it and it was good
45:40
he created in the beginning of time and
45:43
space
45:45
he made this plane to earth and it was
45:47
finished it was finished and it was good
45:50
create ted he created that was past
45:53
tense right
45:54
and then we come to verse two so
45:55
something happened between those two
45:56
verses
45:58
a whole lot because then he starts to
46:02
take it apart
46:03
and put it back together is that what he
46:05
says
46:06
yes there was water on everything water
46:08
on the sky
46:09
water on the land he took the water off
46:12
the firmament
46:14
that was the air that was the sky that
46:16
was in the ground of the ground
46:17
i'm doing my motions again people my
46:20
staff say don't do that
46:23
my hands move okay i can't
46:27
we help it he began to take it apart it
46:30
clearly explains to you what he did
46:32
right
46:33
so he was going to recreate the earth or
46:36
he would not have
46:37
told the animals to replenish
46:42
the earth did you get that word
46:46
re that's like you remodel
46:49
your home you can't remodel a home that
46:51
was never there
46:53
you can't replenish the earth if it
46:55
wasn't there before
46:58
so that's what he did everybody in
46:59
heaven has already seen everything i'm
47:00
telling you about
47:01
he began to take everything apart right
47:04
so that he could then redo the earth and
47:07
then he began to make the animals and
47:08
all the life back on the earth all the
47:10
growth was back on the earth again
47:12
and then he did something different than
47:13
he hadn't done before
47:15
he was going to make man in that amazing
47:20
and then there was the word stepped out
47:23
of the father
47:24
began to form adam's body
47:27
and he looks pretty good i've seen adam
47:29
and eve in heaven yes they have clothes
47:33
and yes you will have clothing
47:38
you actually get a wardrobe he can
47:42
afford more than two garments for you
47:47
aren't you glad
47:48
[Music]
47:51
i get asked that question all the time
47:55
you well your soul's exposed on your
47:57
shoes though
48:01
the soul's exposed
48:06
yeah ask somebody what the sole your
48:08
foot is if you need help just take your
48:10
shoe off and look at it
48:13
the soles exposed on your on the bottom
48:17
of your foot
48:18
you're always touching the ground to
48:19
heaven
48:23
they still have boots they have sandals
48:25
they have all kinds of shoes there to
48:27
wear beautiful things amazing things
48:29
and some of them talk to you
48:33
your clothing will change colors and
48:34
your clothes will change on you while
48:36
you're walking down the street
48:38
if you cannot decide what you should
48:39
have worn
48:42
and you picked out three things as you
48:43
walk each one will come on you
48:47
women
48:48
[Applause]
48:52
heaven is not normal concerning this
48:55
earth
48:58
it's heaven where eye has not seen your
49:01
ear heard or entered in the heart or
49:03
mind of me and god's prepared for those
49:04
that love him
49:05
except in the last it's revealed by thee
49:08
spirit of god
49:10
so that means it can be revealed right
49:13
he's doing that at an accelerated rate
49:17
and he's shown me a lot on purpose
49:21
so he wasted hell i'm going to go back
49:23
to the third day that's okay
49:26
he wasted hell the first day christ goes
49:28
well i'm not going to touch him on wait
49:29
and see if god
49:30
rescues him and he didn't come
49:34
and he had taken him into the they had
49:36
grabbed and put him in the far reaches
49:38
not the outer reaches i've seen there
49:39
too you don't want to know about the
49:40
outer reaches of hell okay
49:42
the far reaches of hell they dragged him
49:44
back what good is that going to do
49:46
if the god of if he shows up right
49:49
what are you going to do you can't hide
49:51
anything nothing is hidden from god
49:53
but they thought well we'll just put him
49:55
back here and hold him well the second
49:56
day came and he didn't show up
49:58
so satan's thinking well i am and now
50:00
i'm stronger than him
50:02
i was smarter than him but it didn't
50:04
work but he still lost
50:05
part of his brain because he really
50:07
thought he was going to win and he was
50:08
going to put on a show to torture the
50:09
son of god
50:10
in front of all of his hierarchy so he
50:12
sent out a message
50:14
for all the principalities and powers
50:15
come in and sit on the front row
50:18
and he moved it from the back of hell to
50:19
the front where the gates are there's a
50:21
courtyard
50:22
the gates of hell the really gates there
50:25
and they could see from
50:26
abraham's muslims he couldn't put a show
50:27
on the only ones who could see would be
50:29
abraham's bosom right
50:30
he's going to put a show on showing that
50:32
he's more powerful than god i'm a torch
50:34
of the son of god
50:36
he wasn't the one that was going to
50:38
torture
50:40
so here comes the third day right he's
50:43
got everything set up
50:44
all the prince pallies and powers the
50:46
big guys are all sitting right there in
50:47
the front row
50:48
i actually was i saw that i was there i
50:50
saw all the little demons screaming and
50:52
yelling
50:52
all they do is scream and yell and
50:53
complain complain and yell and blaspheme
50:56
and complain and yell and blaspheme
50:57
they they all the time because they're
50:59
they're always everybody none of those
51:00
demons like each other
51:02
they want to out do outlie out
51:05
cheat whatever they can that's what they
51:08
do to each other
51:09
and so they were like they were full of
51:11
themselves because they were on the
51:12
front row and all the other ones were
51:13
behind them
51:14
in a little while though they were going
51:15
to be glad they weren't on the front row
51:18
satan put all his uh cleanly attire on
51:22
he had made and uh all of his faults
51:25
gems well he had the gems god still put
51:28
on him if you didn't know god put
51:30
gemstones on him for a reason he had a
51:33
reason
51:34
he put he made mountings like in a ring
51:36
and set these
51:37
amazing beautiful gems there were like
51:40
thousands of them on him and he was
51:43
glorious he was glorious so he still had
51:45
that glory he thought it was his
51:47
he's going to lose it if you know what
51:50
the word says it says christ
51:52
what'd he do say it loud
51:56
yeah that's what he stripped he took
51:58
every single gemstone off of him that
52:00
god put on him
52:02
so here's the show's about to begin
52:04
satan's going to put on a show he was
52:06
talking all of his hierarchy right
52:07
and here's jesus not saying a word just
52:10
like his father
52:11
he wasn't saying a word and then all of
52:13
a sudden
52:14
there was a role of thunder and all of
52:18
hell's attention was gotten because they
52:20
remembered
52:20
what happens after that roll of thunder
52:22
comes
52:24
lightning is going to show up somewhere
52:27
and then jesus christ stands up and
52:30
there is a shout from heaven and
52:32
jesus christ starts releasing the fire
52:34
of god from himself
52:36
and melted the faces of all the
52:38
hierarchy of hell
52:40
he began to they began to burn in the
52:42
midst of hell fire
52:43
with the fire of god literally like blue
52:45
fire was shooting on his hands
52:47
and i saw them melt like wax because as
52:50
a little girl
52:51
i would see them in different places i
52:52
saw these demons and their faces were
52:54
melted like that
52:55
and like wax and i used to think what is
52:58
that
52:59
what did that what did that well i was
53:01
about to find out
53:02
and i mean literally saw them melted it
53:04
says he ruined
53:06
and spoiled principalities
53:10
and powers and made a show of it
53:13
openly and that's what he did he
53:16
literally ruined them they can't go back
53:17
they've never been able to fix their
53:19
self okay
53:20
satan can't fix you if you're in the
53:22
army of darkness and you get wounded he
53:24
can't heal you
53:26
they got parts missing you can't you
53:29
can't make them cease to exist but they
53:31
get wounded they don't get healed okay
53:35
i've seen them the holy spirit calls
53:37
them shabby debris
53:40
and if you knew holy spirit like that's
53:43
exactly what he would say
53:45
because i see the hosts going across the
53:46
sky all the time i'm a seer i see them
53:49
i see the demonic armies after they've
53:51
been in a battle
53:52
with the host of heaven they're hanging
53:54
out for dear life because nobody
53:56
wants to help each other like hanging on
53:58
they have these horrific looks on their
54:00
face because they have just been wiped
54:01
out by the host of heaven
54:04
and i said man they look really bad and
54:05
the holy spirit said i call that shabby
54:08
debris
54:10
and they go i can't think of a better
54:13
thing to call it
54:15
because they look like debris
54:18
you know something washes up on the
54:19
shore where parts of it are missing
54:22
that was them
54:29
we better be glad they don't work
54:30
together well right
54:33
we're glad they don't even like each
54:34
other right because the hosts look out
54:36
for each other they protect each other
54:39
look out for each other they're there
54:40
for each other
54:41
hell is just the opposite nobody cares
54:43
about anybody
54:45
so here comes shabby debris they look
54:48
like
54:48
shabby debris that day in hell and this
54:51
is what jesus was saying
54:52
you will never have the power to hold a
54:56
righteous man in this
54:59
place
55:03
and anyone who received christ they will
55:06
never be able to take you there
55:08
or hold you there amen yeah
55:11
and when he was done wasting the
55:13
principalities and powers then he turns
55:15
to their leader
55:17
they ran they didn't wait around to see
55:20
what was going to happen to him they
55:21
abandoned him
55:22
they left him they were running over top
55:24
of the little demons trying to get out
55:25
of the space
55:27
they were happy they weren't on the
55:28
front row
55:31
that day it worked on their behalf and
55:34
all of abraham's bosom were shouting
55:37
and cheering and yelling
55:40
and celebrating
55:42
[Applause]
55:45
because they'd already given themselves
55:46
to him now there is their messiah wiping
55:50
out the devil
55:52
he he literally he literally ripped his
55:55
clothes off
55:56
threw him on the dirt and one by one
55:58
took every single gemstone away from him
56:00
and he was left with none it was ugly
56:03
because all he had was these spiky
56:04
little
56:05
settings that god had put all over in
56:07
his wings
56:08
and his beings he was decorated
56:12
by god and now he has put false ones in
56:15
there
56:17
he's made false ones they don't look
56:18
anything like what he did
56:20
but he was he was utterly totally
56:23
completely defeated
56:24
he is a doormat he is not
56:28
over you he is under you he is under our
56:31
feet
56:32
so what is under your feet under your
56:34
feet is a doormat
56:38
isn't that what he says
56:42
then don't be afraid of him
56:45
we're not supposed to have any fear in
56:46
us right and the fear of the lord is not
56:49
that you will be afraid that he will
56:50
hurt you
56:52
it is you are afraid you will hurt
56:55
him you're so in love with him
56:58
you don't want to do anything that would
57:00
hurt the lord
57:02
that's what the fear of the lord is the
57:04
fear of the lord is the beginning of
57:07
wisdom and with all your getting of
57:10
wisdom get
57:11
understanding which is knowledge of the
57:14
holy one
57:18
don't you don't you love the word i love
57:19
it
57:21
isn't that good so there you go that was
57:23
a reality show from heaven
57:27
and then he did the the most
57:31
the greatest insult he did to satan was
57:34
to take something that not just his
57:36
he took you know he had no pride left
57:38
really out utterly stripped him of all
57:40
his glory
57:41
and he fell because of that glory but he
57:44
did something even worse than that
57:45
he took away authority
57:49
he took away authority that he had
57:51
gained because adam gave it to him
57:54
and he had been ruling with that
57:55
authority until something changed
57:57
that's one of the reasons why christ had
57:59
to come he had to come
58:01
he had to walk as a man like you and i
58:03
choosing not to sin
58:05
say not to sin he had to choose that
58:08
with his own will not to sin
58:11
because him being not just righteous but
58:13
holy
58:14
okay and then him being going into hell
58:17
and they think that they could keep him
58:19
it was devastating to the enemy when he
58:21
realized we should have never taken him
58:22
because it said if they had known
58:25
they would have never done it right it
58:28
was bushwhack time
58:30
the enemy was bushwhacked by the son of
58:32
god and so he stands there after he
58:35
stripped all this all the gemstones off
58:37
of him
58:37
he reaches down and takes away the keys
58:42
keys represent authority
58:45
they have always represented authority
58:49
and you know that if the wealthiest man
58:51
in a city back in christ's time and even
58:53
before that
58:54
the wealthiest people were given the
58:56
keys to the city
58:58
did you know that that's not just
59:00
something we do here
59:02
on earth you know when you see someone
59:04
comes to hollywood or they come to a
59:06
state they've done something great
59:07
like oral robots was actually given the
59:10
key to oklahoma city by the mayor
59:13
the mayor of the governor one of them
59:14
and they actually redeemed their self
59:18
because they were not on god's high list
59:20
because of the way they had treated oral
59:22
roberts
59:23
they scorned him they made fun of him
59:25
they judged him
59:26
criticized him in the media and the
59:29
newspapers
59:30
but before he died somebody got smart
59:34
and they apologized to him in public
59:37
they gave him the key to the city not
59:40
just the city actually they gave him to
59:41
see
59:41
the key to that city but also i think
59:43
the governor and the mayor were both
59:44
there
59:45
apologized repented on behalf of all
59:47
those who had mistreated him
59:49
recognized him for the contribution that
59:51
he had done for them
59:52
and so they gave him the key to the city
59:55
that's still significant today when you
59:58
have a key
60:00
but the wealthy people were always sat
60:02
in the city gate
60:03
back in jesus times and before that in
60:05
abraham's day the wealthy people sat in
60:07
the city gate with the elders
60:09
and they were recognized because they
60:11
they gave contributions to help the city
60:14
and so they were given keys and they
60:18
were given
60:18
money backs and they had authority they
60:21
had a say
60:22
over what went on in that city they were
60:24
recognized by their wisdom because of
60:26
their wealth
60:26
and so that's just something that's
60:28
always been well he lost all of it in
60:30
hell that day
60:31
he lost all of his authority all of his
60:34
glory
60:36
all of his a lot of respect from the
60:38
demonic because they realized then
60:40
at that very moment our lives aren't
60:42
going to be the same because now we can
60:43
be wasted
60:45
by anyone who is righteous can waste us
60:49
everyone who receives him will now have
60:52
power over us
60:56
so their lives were changing even
60:58
satan's life was changing
61:00
he had to get a lot better deception
61:03
because he no longer had those keys to
61:05
hell
61:06
death in the grave
61:10
i'm i probably won't have time to go
61:11
into tonight but christ uses those keys
61:15
he uses them for us you should be really
61:19
happy about that amen
61:22
we have so many promises given to no no
61:24
one else in the earth
61:25
except those who've received jesus
61:27
christ you have great power on the
61:29
inside of you have great authority
61:31
you have already been given dominion on
61:33
the earth don't
61:35
don't act like you're nothing don't say
61:37
you're nothing
61:38
you have great value everybody person
61:40
everyone here is valued by god
61:42
everyone here was given a gift to use in
61:46
the natural realm
61:49
in heaven you're going to use that gift
61:52
whether it's baking cookies
61:54
making a really amazing barbecue
61:57
designing apparel
61:59
designing interior design designing
62:02
amusement parks
62:03
making movies in heaven uh sports in
62:07
heaven
62:08
are played as worship yet are really
62:11
quiet how many people have never heard
62:12
me talk about this before
62:14
i know somebody who has let me see your
62:16
hands okay
62:18
it makes sense because god gave you that
62:22
gift
62:23
they are irrevocable as a matter of fact
62:26
even the wicked have their gifts and
62:28
they won't be taken away from them
62:30
you choose how to use that gift in the
62:32
earth that's why there's people
62:34
who belong to satan and they have gifts
62:37
to act or sing
62:38
or whatever it is and what they produce
62:40
is dark
62:42
because their heart is dark they're
62:45
going to have the gifts no matter what
62:47
amen
62:49
but your gift is so important that that
62:52
god calls it precious
62:53
is something special he calls you you
62:55
are a gift
62:57
every good and perfect gift that's you
63:01
comes down from the father of lights
63:03
that was you
63:06
you were light you were made out of
63:08
light
63:09
he knit you together in your mother's
63:10
womb at the time of conception that
63:12
spiritual body made out of light was
63:14
knit together
63:15
with that physical little dot of flesh
63:17
and that's when life begins
63:19
but when you came you had you were that
63:22
gift already
63:23
whether it was someone who was going to
63:24
sing or be a musician
63:27
dance create a clothing apparel
63:30
food spices roads highways
63:34
anything you see in this place was
63:36
created by somebody
63:38
it was designed and invented by somebody
63:40
you wouldn't have anything to wear to
63:42
walk on
63:43
to sleep on to sit on to look at
63:45
entertainment places to go and enjoy
63:47
yourself you wouldn't have highways to
63:49
drive on planes to go in
63:50
those were gifts god sent people to be
63:55
and all those gifts are used in heaven
63:59
for everybody who lives there so it's
64:02
not boring
64:05
yes they have stylists there they have
64:07
salons there
64:08
they color your hair with light
64:12
this is heaven culture everyone in
64:15
heaven has color in their hair
64:18
so wear it
64:19
[Music]
64:23
it's like art is considered a form of
64:26
art okay
64:28
they also have the culinary arts in
64:30
heaven
64:31
everybody eats food and they love it
64:35
it tastes better than anything you've
64:36
had on the earth
64:38
and don't argue with me because the
64:40
mirror's supper of the lamb
64:41
is not grapes and crackers
64:46
if the lord of glory was going to have a
64:48
supper
64:51
he made everything that ever existed
64:53
he's not going to give you just grapes
64:57
there'll be unending food everywhere
65:02
everything you love to eat with no
65:03
weight gain or food allergies
65:08
and i i happen to know that that wedding
65:11
supper
65:13
is going to last a long long
65:17
[Music]
65:20
time
65:22
he has a really big house
65:24
[Laughter]
65:29
this is just reality time i guess we're
65:31
having a reality heaven show
65:34
of things that happen throughout time
65:37
okay
65:38
even elijah loves to tell the story of
65:40
the prophets of baal
65:42
because he saw what happened in the
65:44
spirit realm
65:45
when all that went on so when you go to
65:48
heaven now and he shares it
65:50
it has a whole different meaning
65:53
like when you get to heaven and you get
65:55
to see how christ wasted hell
65:58
you will shout and scream forever
66:04
there was the day satan was kicked out
66:06
there was a day he was crushed down
66:08
he had authority stripped from him he
66:11
was unseated
66:13
from his authority that he operated in
66:15
the earth for
66:16
generations and ages because something
66:18
new was happening
66:20
the messiah was on the earth and then he
66:23
went and died
66:24
for us so that every every sin you ever
66:27
commit
66:27
when you repent and say when i repent
66:31
it will be forgiven he will cleanse me
66:34
from all unrighteousness
66:37
like it never happened
66:44
heaven absolutely celebrates every time
66:46
somebody
66:47
gives herself to christ especially all
66:50
the family members who never get to
66:51
never miss it every family member saw
66:54
all of your family get born again
66:57
they saw the babies being born they saw
66:59
the weddings
67:00
every birthday on your birthday they go
67:03
in heaven get a gift and put it in your
67:05
mansion that's being built
67:06
so when you come there every year you
67:08
were apart they have a gift for you
67:11
you got a lot of family you'll have them
67:12
up to the ceiling
67:14
probably going out the doors
67:19
your pets will be there
67:24
taking over your mansion
67:27
if you had a whole lot you probably have
67:29
heaven's zoo
67:34
because he has a sense of humor beyond
67:38
not just his creativity is beyond what
67:40
you imagine his humor
67:42
is beyond anything you imagined
67:45
and you will not stop laughing
67:48
okay you will laugh till you fall on the
67:50
streets of gold
67:52
and people step over you
68:00
everybody wants to know you the
68:02
disciples will come to greet you
68:04
the prophets we have prophets watching
68:07
us right now
68:08
from heaven they're watching this
68:09
meeting right now while i talk about
68:10
them
68:12
okay we have the the ancient prophets we
68:15
have the
68:16
new ones who just passed home to heaven

69:10
because you won't use it down there
69:13
not only do not have breakfast in hell
69:15
they don't have movies in hell either
69:16
okay
69:17
you don't get popcorn you get nothing
69:20
in heaven you have this little menu that
69:22
appears and you pick what you want and
69:24
there's your food right there while you
69:25
watch the movie
69:28
the movie that is being captured
69:30
probably not far from where you're at
69:32
shown instantaneously in these cedars in
69:34
heaven they're called reality theaters
69:37
it was the very first place they took me
69:41
they could have taken me anywhere in
69:43
1996
69:44
i was caught up to heaven for the first
69:46
time jesus warned me
69:48
walked through the wall of my home while
69:50
i was doing dishes although i spent a
69:52
lot of time in prayer it wasn't during
69:53
that time he walked in while i was
69:55
washing dishes
69:56
not my favorite thing to do i tell
69:59
people i'm not susie homemaker okay
70:02
i am a business person but of course i
70:04
raised three daughters
70:06
i was a wife i had to take care of my
70:08
home
70:09
while i was doing everything else at the
70:11
same time and so jesus walked through
70:13
the wall of my home he said go sit down
70:15
the father and i are going to start
70:16
taking you on tours of heaven
70:19
and i didn't say no
70:23
and the first place it took me was to
70:24
have a fun place because i knew there
70:26
was a throne room
70:28
i knew there were certain places already
70:30
in heaven i knew they were there i knew
70:31
about the river of life it talks about
70:33
it in the word of god
70:34
it says heaven is a country and it's a
70:36
city so i knew they had both
70:38
even if i hadn't seen them i knew they
70:39
were both there go read hebrews 8.
70:41
correct it's in hebrew right it says
70:44
heaven is a city it's a country
70:46
yeah so go read and hebrews actually
70:48
talks a lot about heaven
70:50
that's where the great cloud of
70:51
witnesses is talked about the great
70:52
people of faith have passed on to
70:54
so go read hebrews it talks about heaven
70:57
so i knew there were certain things
70:58
there
70:59
but and i was delighted i thought there
71:02
was probably something fun to do i
71:03
didn't realize
71:04
that heaven is almost 50 50. half fun
71:09
and half profound when his children came
71:13
home he had to have something for them
71:14
to enjoy and do
71:16
and so yeah i was the first place i was
71:18
taken uh jesus came
71:20
in the person yes i knew it was him i'd
71:23
actually seen him cut a few times on the
71:24
earth before he walked through the wall
71:26
of my home
71:27
i've known him since i was four years
71:28
old i got saved twice age four and age
71:30
five
71:33
and this was 1996 when this happened so
71:35
i had had
71:37
encounters with angels i could see i was
71:39
always a seer i'd see the demonic
71:41
operations i see
71:42
heaven's operations all around me my
71:45
grandmother had some of that in her my
71:47
dad had encounters with angels
71:48
it was a way of life it wasn't like
71:51
strange something strange to me
71:53
but it was absolutely delightful to see
71:56
that there's
71:57
so many fun things to do in heaven and
72:00
what's in my books are encounters i had
72:03
and how people got stunned when god
72:04
would take me up
72:05
let me stand by their family members who
72:07
had just passed away i heard them
72:09
talking about their life on earth i knew
72:10
the family members names i knew what
72:12
they looked like
72:13
even though i had never met them on the
72:14
earth then god would walk me through
72:16
their mansions i would see how the
72:18
mansion was built i knew what was on
72:19
their property
72:20
and then he would bring me back down and
72:22
then he would give me
72:23
their family members names and phone
72:25
numbers on the earth
72:28
if he can take you to heaven and show
72:31
you stuff if he knows there'll be hair
72:32
on your head
72:33
he knows all your phone numbers right
72:38
and i would write it down he'd have me
72:39
call he'd have me type everything down
72:41
i heard and saw and then it would call
72:44
these people and say
72:45
i didn't have pink hair back then when i
72:47
used to do that okay he still shows me
72:49
people but
72:49
but when i started this whole thing i
72:52
didn't have pain care
72:53
and i say uh i believe god has shown me
72:55
something about your family member in
72:57
heaven would you like to know what it is
72:59
and i didn't know these people i i
73:01
didn't know they didn't even know how i
73:02
got their number
73:02
i didn't want to tell my got their
73:04
number i just said
73:05
god has shown me something and they will
73:08
go who are you talking about and i say
73:09
their family member's name
73:12
they would get they would i couldn't see
73:14
but i knew they were shaking on the
73:15
other end of the line
73:16
and they go uh yes i want to know
73:21
will you meet me at the mall will you
73:23
meet me at the park because they sure
73:25
weren't going to invite me to their home
73:28
they never wanted to take me to their
73:29
home they never ever ever took me to
73:31
their home
73:32
and i would show up and i would have
73:34
everything typed down on a piece of
73:35
paper
73:36
god even gave it a title did you know
73:38
god loves to name things
73:39
he gave it a title like it was a script
73:42
and i wrote it like it was a script i
73:44
put
73:44
everything in quotes that jesus said
73:46
that i heard them say
73:48
you know i described the aromas the
73:51
emotions
73:52
the colors everything the frequencies
73:56
that were there
73:57
how they traveled what was in their
73:59
mansion what it looked like what their
74:00
favorite colors were what their gift was
74:02
because they were using their gift
74:04
and i didn't know anything about them
74:06
and i tell them to sit down
74:08
and i would hold the paper up here so i
74:10
didn't look at them
74:11
and i just began to read and i would
74:13
hear them laugh
74:14
and cry and cry and laugh and laugh and
74:17
cry
74:18
and they would shake and when i was done
74:20
i'd say
74:21
do you believe god showed me this about
74:23
your family member in heaven and it
74:24
wasn't for me
74:26
it was for them and they go i don't know
74:29
you
74:29
i never met you but you told me things
74:32
only my family member would know
74:34
so i have to believe you saw my family
74:37
member
74:38
they were so absolutely undone and then
74:40
they began to tell me
74:41
they confirmed what i saw because i knew
74:43
what they were doing and i knew what
74:44
their gift was because you used that
74:46
gift in heaven
74:46
whether they were a florist in heaven or
74:49
they're designing
74:49
apparel in heaven uh whether they were
74:52
over the youth in heaven which the 13
74:54
year old girl was put over the
74:56
youth of heaven and she was 13.
74:59
and her whole life she planned to be a
75:01
youth pastor
75:04
and she met her kids in her elementary
75:05
school in her middle school
75:07
everybody loved her i heard from her
75:10
mother after i shared all the stuff i
75:11
saw her with her great grandfather that
75:12
looked like he was in his 20s
75:14
and he was taking her on rollercoaster
75:16
rides in the amusement park
75:19
and i mean huge roller coasters like the
75:20
biggest one is called the rush
75:22
it leaps off the track goes across the
75:24
sky to another part of the track
75:31
yeah i thought that was pretty cool and
75:34
the wild thing was the angels were
75:36
riding them too
75:42
they were riding them too i could not
75:45
see the end of this amusement park i've
75:47
been there three times i could not see
75:48
the end to it
75:50
kids got in bubbles and rode over it in
75:52
bubbles or you went by
75:54
you went and learned how to fly like
75:55
superman then you flew over it
75:59
guess who teaches you how to fly
76:03
christopher reeves
76:07
i hear your thoughts
76:11
he got born again
76:14
he got born again what did he do
76:18
on earth he was superman right
76:23
he teaches you to fly in heaven
76:29
so i'm telling you this is all this is
76:31
in my first trip to heaven
76:33
and i remember every aroma every emotion
76:36
i remember i remember every word that
76:38
people said i remember every creature
76:40
that i saw what they look like their
76:41
flowers saying they changed colors
76:43
the host of heaven were there there was
76:45
these beautiful angels that were green
76:46
like dust like green emerald dust
76:49
stepped out the waterfalls and they
76:50
cared for the waterfalls and the streams
76:52
in heaven
76:54
and they were feminine looking they were
76:58
so captivating their song was so
77:00
captivating so i remember
77:02
all that in my first trip and christ i
77:05
remember christ
77:06
took me aside before he brought me back
77:08
and he goes i want you to tell them on
77:10
the earth
77:10
there'll be many people in heaven they
77:11
never expected to see there but they
77:13
prayed them
77:14
in if they don't give up on them
77:18
we will not give up on them if you
77:21
belong to me
77:22
i won't let your words drop to the
77:23
ground
77:25
and i got undone i think it was the most
77:27
spectacular thing that happened when i
77:29
was there was when he told me that
77:30
because he said it will give hope to so
77:32
many people
77:34
because he's a good god isn't he
77:38
and so i saw this young girl was talking
77:40
to her great grandfather as they're
77:41
walking down this path going through
77:43
when you're going into a new part of
77:45
heaven there's gates that are always
77:46
open
77:47
there's just like columns with gates
77:48
there's not walls
77:50
inside heaven and and that's they were
77:52
going through these big purple and gold
77:54
gates and they were going to the
77:55
amusement park i didn't know that at the
77:56
time
77:57
and so the lord said get up there so you
77:59
can hear what that young girl is saying
78:01
and she was talking about her mom
78:03
that they had a great relationship when
78:04
i see my mom again i'm going to kiss her
78:06
on both cheeks
78:07
i'm going to share everything that's
78:08
happened to me up here in heaven i wish
78:10
she knew i was a youth leader in heaven
78:13
and then and she just kept talking then
78:15
i saw them go on a roller coaster ride
78:18
and then christ brought me back and i
78:20
got her mom's number and called her and
78:22
the funeral had just happened and she
78:24
was her at that time her only daughter
78:27
and uh although i was told later that
78:30
she was profited over by a prophetess
78:32
that
78:33
she would have a very short life but she
78:34
wouldn't pack the whole world for christ
78:37
which she was because of the testimony
78:40
and so when i was sharing this with her
78:42
mom outside jc penney's
78:45
at a table at the mall she got undone
78:48
and
78:49
she began to tell me after i told her
78:51
all the stuff i saw i saw on the roller
78:53
coasters i heard the words that she said
78:55
and she she was crying and weeping and
78:56
she said that what i told you i've never
78:59
known you've never met you i've never
79:00
don't know you but you said things only
79:02
my daughter knew she goes the day before
79:04
she died
79:05
the day before they buried her i was in
79:07
her room and i saw a journal under her
79:09
bed
79:09
that was written she was like seven her
79:11
daughter was 13 when she passed away
79:13
she said i start to go through it and
79:14
look at the pages and i found written on
79:16
the pages
79:17
these words last night i dreamed i died
79:19
early and went to heaven early
79:21
i saw my great grandfather and i went on
79:23
roller coaster rides
79:26
i didn't know that journal was there
79:29
it was wonderful but he only gave me a
79:31
peak so as fast as the roller coaster i
79:33
fell back to earth
79:36
and her mother was the only one who knew
79:37
about that journal
79:39
and i didn't know her mother you know
79:41
what god was doing
79:42
he was giving me evidence that heaven
79:44
was not only real but it was fun
79:47
she said her daughter every day would
79:49
kiss her on both cheeks before she went
79:50
to school when she came on she shared
79:52
everything
79:53
that had happened to her life in her
79:55
life during that day
79:56
and she had planned her whole life to be
79:58
a leader
79:59
a youth pastor and a leader that was her
80:02
goal and she was doing that in heaven at
80:04
age 13.
80:06
i heard her say you know that um i'm
80:09
cheering my mom
80:10
on you know she didn't know she couldn't
80:12
see me okay people never saw me in
80:14
heaven
80:14
but i heard all these words and she said
80:16
that she was a cheerleader
80:18
and her favorite colors were blue and
80:19
white she was wearing a blue white tunic
80:21
top and pant
80:22
when i saw her it was her favorite color
80:24
even on earth so you still have your
80:26
favorite colors in heaven
80:28
and so all these things everything i
80:30
said that i wrote down that i remembered
80:32
was significant to her
80:34
she's never been the same since then she
80:36
said she was my only daughter they tell
80:38
me i can't have children god said tell
80:40
her
80:40
that she will have children i'll give
80:41
her children and she has two
80:43
twins right now ten-year-old twins with
80:46
strawberry blonde hair like marissa had
80:48
blue eyes and strawberry blonde hair
80:50
twins and they have encounters in heaven
80:55
so we have a good god that cares about
80:58
you that cares about me
81:00
you won't miss your destiny when you go
81:03
to heaven
81:03
none of your children will miss their
81:05
destiny whatever he chose them to be
81:08
here
81:08
and that gift he gave them if it was a
81:10
dancer there'll be a dancer in heaven
81:12
if it was a cookie baker there'd be a
81:13
cookie baker in heaven if it was a
81:15
fisherman there'll be a fisherman in
81:17
heaven
81:17
if it was to create and invent all kinds
81:19
of neat
81:21
a high-tech gadgets they actually have a
81:23
place called techno city in heaven
81:26
where all the geeks live
81:30
and they can create all kinds of just
81:33
the wildest craziest
81:34
things you even beyond what we have here
81:36
on the earth although i saw some of
81:38
those being brought to the earth
81:41
because they have an idea zone in heaven
81:44
and you see all these little sparkles in
81:46
it like a million little pieces of
81:48
glitter
81:49
and every one of them is an idea an
81:50
invention and god sends he takes a wave
81:53
of that and sends it over the earth and
81:54
it drops all these ideas and inventions
81:56
in our minds
81:58
and whoever grabs that idea
82:02
and creates that idea that's why i see
82:05
things
82:05
on the earth already that i've seen in
82:08
heaven
82:10
they come from him does it say that they
82:12
come from him
82:13
yeah that's how he sends them isn't that
82:16
amazing
82:19
so god has a lot of plans for us right
82:21
here on this earth
82:23
right now everybody in here is special
82:25
because you're alive right now
82:28

82:38
it's not about how much education you've
82:40
had it's not about what race you're born
82:42
in
82:43
it has nothing to do with any of that it
82:46
has to do that you belong to jesus
82:48
christ that you have given your life to
82:50
him
82:50

82:53

84:43
she keeps us real doesn't she i can't
84:46
wait to see what she's going to pick
84:50
we're living in a new time like i was
84:52
explaining
84:53
john the baptist brought a new time with
84:55
him
84:56
there were new ways to do things okay
84:59
that had nothing to do with the past
85:01
and a lot of people rejected it because
85:03
they knew
85:04
god had said to do it this way well in
85:07
that time he did things a certain way he
85:09
himself does never change
85:11
but he is a great creator and he does
85:13
bring new things to the earth all the
85:15
time
85:16
and people go well if i can't see it
85:18
line by line written well it doesn't say
85:20
he's going to have microwaves do you
85:21
have one
85:23
it doesn't say he'll have cell phones
85:24
but do you own one
85:26
okay it doesn't even talk about cars but
85:28
do you have one
85:30
yes because as time goes by
85:34
new things are brought to the earth and
85:36
invented
85:37
that we use to to improve our life is
85:40
that correct
85:43
that so that doesn't mean there's going
85:44
to be that you won't see new things
85:46
you've never seen before
85:48
and these are things i'm talking about
85:49
that will help all of humanity
85:51
to either in to either make your life
85:54
easier
85:54
or to make you have a happier life a
85:57
healthier life
85:59
a more informed life there are new
86:01
things coming to this earth
86:03
i saw roads that we traveled on that
86:05
were made out of light
86:07
and the fuel was the light
86:12
i'm glad someone's excited
86:13
[Laughter]
86:16
i i was shown these new things we will
86:19
have hologram computers
86:22
we can reach in and take the things out
86:24
of the light and look at them and put
86:25
them back in there
86:31
i saw several major diseases
86:34
including cancer that did not even exist
86:36
on the earth
86:41
it'll be abolished just think how much
86:43
that'll change your life new fuels
86:45
one is coming from outer space
86:51
are you all excited saying man because
86:54
you're staring at me
86:59
do you know how much that will change
87:02
our life we won't need the fuel from the
87:06
desert
87:07
or the sheiks we won't even need the
87:11
coal from underground
87:12
okay we won't even need solar energy
87:16
i'm not talking about solar energy a
87:19
whole fuel that god already put
87:21
up there and all they need is the night
87:24
the right receiver
87:26
to bring it down in the transmitters in
87:28
everybody's home
87:29
to fuel your entire home and i saw what
87:31
they look like
87:33
they're about this big and you can move
87:37
it wherever you want to
87:39
you go in the middle of desert and camp
87:40
and have have energy
87:46
your bug zappers won't be fly swatters
87:48
anymore
87:53
because i take one when i go and i want
87:56
one that big
87:59
because i don't like bugs when i was 16
88:03
at a youth camp and i was finally
88:05
invited to a banquet by someone who was
88:07
brave
88:09
my mama bought me this pretty dress had
88:11
white lace sleeves to here and my neck
88:12
was up to here
88:14
and i went and took that thing that was
88:15
hanging in the cabin i put on a walk-out
88:17
to go meet my date for the banquet
88:19
and something was moving up my sleeve
88:22
i already told you i don't like it want
88:24
no little bug it was this big
88:28
and it was crawling up my arm this way
88:32
and i was really shy so i wasn't going
88:35
to tell anybody
88:37
it was one of those grasshoppers black
88:39
and red ones you know those things
88:42
look like they came either from hell or
88:44
from some other planet
88:48
they look like they could take over the
88:49
world and wanted to
88:51
they had an attitude if you ever looked
88:53
him in the eye
88:55
i wouldn't i wouldn't suggest you do
88:57
that
88:59
when i'm i'm here like this right trying
89:01
to calmly talk
89:04
first time in my life i went anywhere
89:07
with the opposite sex
89:08
at all i got this pretty dress on
89:12
and and the sleeves you know i was i was
89:15
i was real skinny i mean
89:16
real skinny and so that's the only
89:18
reason why that thing was able to get up
89:19
there
89:20
and i've got lace you know lace does not
89:22
move okay you can't open it up and shake
89:24
something out
89:25
so this thing is crawling further and
89:27
further and i'm like i'm trying to hang
89:29
on to it right
89:30
and i'm like i thought it was gonna
89:32
faint in front of them
89:34
that's not gonna be a good first
89:36
impression
89:38
excuse me and i i was a really fast
89:40
runner i chased my brothers all the time
89:42
from my mama
89:44
i ran so fast back to that cab and
89:46
locked the door and i threw everything
89:48
off
89:48
i was going to take everything and there
89:50
was that big oaky thing this big
89:53
i didn't kill it i didn't want to go
89:54
anywhere near i'm like what i'm gonna do
89:56
i had to wait for it to walk away
89:58
from my clothes so i could put him back
90:00
on and go back out there you know
90:02
about 15 minutes later and he goes are
90:04
you okay i am i'm really good
90:08
i'm all good right now and i sent my
90:11
friends in the cabin to
90:13
for the demise of the grasshopper
90:16
so when i go camping i take big things
90:19
to deal with the bugs but when you get
90:21
this energy from space okay
90:23
you can get the biggest bug zapper and
90:26
probably put it around your entire tent
90:28
so anything that comes out there is
90:30
going to get zapped before it ever gets
90:32
inside
90:34
it was the most amazing thing it was
90:35
just like a they had this thing
90:37
that you pulled it down from space and
90:40
everybody had them
90:41
they just had them in their homes i saw
90:43
them line highways
90:45
and a hologram light they didn't have
90:47
lamp posts like solid like this
90:49
they had little things like this and all
90:52
they did was have to place them where
90:53
they went and
90:54
attached them to the ground they had one
90:55
little station a little kind of a thing
90:57
like that
90:58
and when they hit it the lights shot up
91:00
from the ground and let the entire
91:02
highway all the way down
91:05
you didn't have to dig in the ground
91:08
plant wiring run
91:10
all the way down somewhere and hook it
91:11
up to something this was
91:13
a new form of energy that will change
91:16
our
91:16
world the missionaries wherever they are
91:20
they can have
91:20
power all the time no matter where you
91:23
are out in the ocean on a boat it
91:25
doesn't matter where you are because
91:26
it's going to draw it down
91:28
from space and he took me quite a while
91:31
showing me this took me into the future
91:33
and showed me someone this is going to
91:34
be a great day for everybody
91:36
and he said in your life in your
91:38
lifetime which is probably forever
91:40
it is going to happen
91:43
i'm not planning to die i don't know
91:44
about you
91:48
i'm staying till he's done with me i'll
91:50
let him choose that amen
91:51
[Music]
91:54
i'm not planning to escape by my rapture
91:56
rug
91:58
because even we can't decide that right
92:00
so i'm just trying
92:01
i'm just trying to share a little bit
92:04
about what is coming into your lives
92:06
it will affect you your kids your
92:08
grandchildren great grandchildren great
92:11
great great great
92:14
great great grandchildren
92:17
[Music]
92:18
there have been quite a few people that
92:21
have been caught up and taken
92:22
over 100 years into the future i've been
92:26
taking almost 150 years into the future
92:29
and the perils times had not happened
92:32
but it got better and greater and more
92:35
powerful
92:36
because the body of christ was standing
92:38
up and being who god called them to be
92:41
they no longer tolerated darkness or
92:44
evil
92:44
they weren't participating with it by by
92:47
complaining and saying what they didn't
92:48
have
92:49
and who they weren't they stopped saying
92:51
words
92:53
of negativity you can't live a positive
92:56
prosperous life if your soul is
92:58
continually being fed
93:00
negative words you just can't do it and
93:03
actually if all you do is take in the
93:05
doom and gloom you're not even going to
93:06
be happy
93:07
do you know god told me in order to
93:08
create an event you had to be happy
93:12
you had to be happy you know actually
93:15
isn't happy better than sad
93:18
do you know there's more things released
93:20
in your body
93:22
that are good when you are happy when
93:25
you're sad and oppression comes things
93:27
start
93:27
changing even inside the way that your
93:30
body is forming i don't know
93:32
all those details about that okay i
93:34
don't know those details don't care
93:35
about them
93:36
i just know that your inward workings of
93:38
your body begin to not be good
93:41
and if you live around negativity all
93:43
the time then that's not good for you
93:46
but you can change the atmosphere even
93:47
where you live
93:49
go in your room and say i'm not
93:50
participating with all these words i'm
93:52
evicting all these words out of the
93:53
atmosphere of where i live
93:55
i don't have to tolerate them i'm
93:56
releasing the life of god the power of
93:58
god the presence of god right here this
94:00
is the atmosphere i'm gonna breathe
94:02
it doesn't matter who owns that place if
94:04
you were there you have the right to
94:06
change the atmosphere you live in
94:10
you can imagine if the body of christ
94:12
ever gets this about the new
94:14
time and starts operating like that how
94:16
much change are we going to bring we
94:18
were sent here to help
94:19
change things is that right christ came
94:22
and changed many things just a few short
94:25
years he was here
94:27
he rocked this world
94:32
it's our time to put on a show
94:36
this is all about the show begins you
94:39
saw you heard about the show in heaven
94:41
and let me tell you when all that was
94:42
going on of the deception of the angels
94:45
it wasn't just like calmly quietly done
94:48
that's not the way it was done
94:49
it was great deception and lucifer never
94:52
told them i'm going to take over and be
94:53
evil and kill steal and destroy
94:55
he didn't say that to any of those
94:57
angels he said i'm going to be greater
94:59
than god
95:00
i care more i'm wiser he doesn't know
95:03
what i'm doing he doesn't know what i'm
95:04
saying
95:05
so i'm going to make sure everybody has
95:06
wealth everybody has power
95:08
we can all celebrate together while i
95:10
rule
95:12
and then he would have his own concerts
95:14
and said he trafficked his wares
95:17
he showed off that he could create
95:20
because he was highly anointed for that
95:22
and he would do that and he'd draw
95:24
angels to himself let me tell you
95:26
a third of them followed him but
95:28
two-thirds didn't follow him
95:31
and angels are real beings like you and
95:34
i
95:35
they're not married okay god had some
95:37
mercy on them
95:45
i'll be married 40 years to the same
95:47
human being this november
95:51
and i'm not picking anyone else okay
95:54
been through it once
95:56
didn't just survive but i'm victorious i
95:58
actually is still very much in love with
96:00
my husband
96:02
and everybody knows it's a journey isn't
96:04
it
96:06
you learn to love and die and love and
96:09
die and love and die and love and die
96:12
to someone dies more than the other
96:14
there's a lot more love
96:16
and then you keep loving having grace so
96:18
they can finish dying to their self
96:21
and then it's wonderful
96:26
[Laughter]
96:29
but you won't be married in heaven
96:31
you'll be best friends
96:33
you'll remember you were married you'll
96:35
do things all over heaven together
96:38
and you will show off who is your
96:40
husband who is your wife on the earth
96:42
you celebrate all over heaven you go
96:44
look at isn't she gorgeous
96:46
it's the most beautiful thing you've
96:48
seen this is who i was married to
96:51
on earth yeah and they won't talk about
96:54
any of the hard times
96:57
they won't talk about any of the crazy
96:58
times okay
97:01
oh you share them
97:06
if you had pets you share
97:09
them because you live right next door
97:14
and you're
97:18
i was a you're parent are you a better
97:21
parent
97:24
they'll probably visit you more often
97:32
you share them it's like children like
97:34
when when um
97:35
when parents come home to heaven if you
97:37
if you had a miscarried little baby
97:39
and you get that little baby you share
97:40
them they stay with the mother stay with
97:42
the father
97:42
but this is it most of those people go
97:44
everywhere together in heaven
97:47
and and there's no like there's not like
97:48
sleepovers okay although people move in
97:50
and stay with you for a while i'm just
97:52
preparing you
97:54
i'm giving you a heads up warning right
97:56
now
97:57
when you come home to heaven all of your
97:59
family will move into your mansion
98:02
they probably already got their space
98:04
picked out
98:07
because they have missed you and they
98:10
want to be with you
98:11
okay this is a good news if you're going
98:14
on a tour tell them to enjoy their self
98:16
till you get back
98:18
only they're probably going to follow
98:19
you on the tour everybody goes on tours
98:20
of heaven
98:24
it doesn't matter if you stay with each
98:25
other it doesn't matter okay
98:27
i saw a whole i call them community
98:29
mansions it was like a big hub
98:31
like a big huge massive common area like
98:34
probably like half of denver and off of
98:37
this
98:39
this com common area which was so
98:41
supernatural was things you all enjoyed
98:43
doing together on the earth it was uh
98:44
even if it could include outdoor stuff
98:46
by the way you can't say it was all like
98:48
under a building no i'm talking about it
98:50
was everything you enjoyed doing on the
98:52
earth together as a family
98:54
and then off of this are all these
98:56
massive mansions
98:57
coming off almost like a wheel with
98:59
spokes
99:00
and every spoke would be like i don't
99:02
know i saw mansions the size of a city
99:05
so i can't ever even say
99:07
how big these mansions were and so
99:09
everybody had their own space because
99:10
you come home
99:12
as his son and his daughter
99:16
okay that's how you come home because he
99:19
is your father
99:20
when you come home he recognizes your
99:21
son and your daughter
99:23
and he gives everybody their own space
99:24
and you will be very glad you have it
99:27
you will love whatever it gives you to
99:29
be so supernatural you could never
99:30
afford to pay for it buy it or even
99:32
build it here
99:33
and it's going to be built around your
99:35
gift the thing that is your passion that
99:36
you love the most
99:40
and then you go on tours all over heaven
99:42
and christ invites you to his own
99:43
private mansion
99:45
where he throws a big party for you and
99:46
invites all the disciples the apostles
99:48
the prophets to come and see you and
99:51
they're coming there to meet you
99:53
he sends a special chariot or carriage
99:56
to come and pick you up and then he has
99:59
you decked out like a king or a queen
100:01
and then you come and he escorts you
100:03
into his place
100:05
and introduces you and everybody
100:07
celebrates that you're there
100:10
and then you eat like forever
100:12
[Music]
100:14
he has a massive ballroom is the biggest
100:16
part of his mansion because he loves to
100:18
dance
100:19
and on all the all down the walls are
100:21
like king's tables laden with every kind
100:23
of dessert you can imagine
100:27
and his mansion sits in this field of
100:29
flowers that are like six foot tall
100:31
all of them sing the most glorious songs
100:35
they are worshiping the lord of glory
100:37
they will all know your name they will
100:38
all welcome you as you come down this
100:40
magnificent drive
100:42
to say everybody say jesus deserves his
100:45
own place
100:48
just like us and he has one
100:52
but he made a way so that you will never
100:55
be away from him
100:56
do y'all like this reality show tonight
100:59
[Laughter]
101:01
some people are hearing it for the first
101:02
time if we're live streaming are we live
101:03
streaming
101:04
some some of these people for the first
101:06
time in their life are probably getting
101:07
rocked
101:08
you know their mind is probably still
101:10
going bonk after the first time i talk
101:12
to them about something
101:14
because that's what heaven does to you
101:15
when you get there you walk around like
101:20
you don't even know what to say you're
101:22
looking at everything you're undone by
101:24
the ground by the grass by the sky
101:27
by the beings by the sounds the images
101:29
of frequencies people riding on their
101:30
worship you know
101:32
i mean beams of light shooting by and
101:34
it's a person coming from somewhere in
101:35
heaven
101:36
you step into these transport kiosks
101:38
that are light beams shooting out and
101:40
you ride on the light
101:42
to places around here and you're walking
101:43
down these streets of gold if you can
101:45
you can look in them you can it can
101:47
actually see your image in the streets
101:49
of gold it looks like uh
101:50
i don't know it's transparent gold but
101:53
it's beautiful you can't even tell the
101:54
depth of it
101:55
you can't there's gems everywhere
101:57
massive gems everywhere
101:59
the mulch and the flower beds are gems
102:02
like real gems
102:04
and the angels will come sometimes and
102:05
grab them up and throw them down to the
102:07
earth
102:08
and that's how they get in the meetings
102:12

102:57
i can't even remember in the natural
102:59
words anymore
103:01
i have a photographic memory he gave me
103:03
that from the time i was a little kid it
103:05
helped a lot in school
103:07
i look at a list one time you never have
103:09
to look it again i remembered everything
103:10
it said
103:11
i'd read one thing like you know two
103:13
weeks later we had a test and i would
103:14
pass every test
103:15
because i remember but he wanted
103:17
somebody with a with a photographic
103:19
memory to do this
103:20
so they could remember everything i
103:21
remember the thousands of times i've
103:23
been there i remember everything
103:27
i remember every detail i remember the
103:29
aromas will get you undone
103:32
the christ himself carries an aroma
103:35
and i can go places and i know he was
103:37
there
103:39
it's beautiful it's a beautiful smell
103:41
but i also smell the other side
103:44
i know when they've been in places and
103:46
it's putrid
103:48
it smells like death so yes
103:52
they both exist heaven exists hell
103:55
exists
103:56
just like the bible says okay you have
103:59
to read the word
104:00
to know it if you don't know the word
104:04
then he can't bring it alive to you if
104:06
you don't read the word he can't bring
104:08
he can't highlight stuff i know how many
104:10
people have ever happened you've read a
104:11
scripture so many times in one day you
104:13
read it and it comes alive to you
104:15
[Applause]
104:18
if you read the word you are storing it
104:21
in your soul
104:23
and in a moment when you need it that's
104:25
how come it comes
104:26
up in you because you put it there
104:29
yourself when you read it
104:31
i play the bible somewhere in my house
104:34
and it's always feeding my soul you can
104:36
feed your soul at night while you're
104:38
sleeping
104:39

104:41
don't but i play
104:43
powerful anointed worship 24 hours a day
104:45
in my home
104:47
because he inhabits the praises of his
104:49
people
104:50

104:52
on a cd
104:54

105:25
these spiritual kings who will walk in
105:27
the earth
105:29
that's whoever runs after that
105:33
those are eternal levels of authority
105:36

105:37
me
105:38

105:41

105:58
of spiritual kings who will walk in high
106:01

will demonstrate they operate in that
106:08
authority

and dominion in the earth and that's how
106:11
people will know who they are
106:13

00:13
while they're doing that
00:15
jesus is right behind me on the platform
00:19
[Applause]
00:20
[Music]
00:23
he's right there
00:31
[Music]
00:33
[Applause]
00:42
wow
00:47
he has an agenda
00:52
it's called america
01:09
all right
01:16
when she started flagging that sound you
01:20
heard was
01:21
his train filling the temple
01:25
and there was an angel bigger than this
01:27
building outside
01:29
he was flapping his wings he was moving
01:32
his wings
01:33
and then all the others stepped through
01:35
him and filled here
01:36
and then jesus stepped right through
01:37
that wall
01:40
that's what you were feeling his
01:42
presence he was overwhelmed and undone
01:45
by the worship
01:47
he loves the hearts of those who worship
01:49
in spirit and in truth
01:52
and he walked up to me and said i'm
01:54
going to speak today
01:56
and tell this world what i think about
01:59
[Applause]
02:06
america
02:12
who am i
02:15
i am that i am i am from the beginning
02:23
and the end
02:26
there is no man who has lived on this
02:29
earth that i did not make
02:34
that my father did not carry until they
02:37
were sent here
02:41
we did not create evil
02:46
that was birthed in a created being
02:48
because he chose it
02:50
do not choose darkness it will overtake
02:54
you and consume you
02:58
it will blind the light we put inside of
03:02
you
03:04
no one will take my country
03:08
no one will remove my name
03:11
off of your documents or your buildings
03:15
no one will remove the blood strikes
03:19
on your flag
03:21
[Music]
03:22
no one can stand before me and say
03:25
they are greater than i am
03:29
for i am going to rebirth america
03:34
it will be greater than it ever was
03:36
before it has not even seen
03:38
the peak of its greatness
03:42
america is great because i created it to
03:45
be great
03:46
it is my gift to the nations
03:51
i created it to stand with my people in
03:54
israel
03:56
for america is a friend of israel
04:00
i hid america in their name
04:04
j e r
04:08
u s a
04:11
l e m
04:14
if you want to know where america is in
04:16
the bible it's in the name
04:18
of jerusalem
04:19
[Applause]
04:22
for i have hidden it i hid
04:25
it before i birthed it the enemy wants
04:29
it
04:29
if he thinks he can make decrees over my
04:32
country
04:34
i will wipe them out
04:36
[Applause]
04:38
i will overturn every wicked law every
04:41
evil decree
04:42
i will remove every wicked person
04:47
for i have chosen someone to sit in the
04:50
white house
04:50
and he will sit in the white house as
04:54
president
04:56
if you do not like him then you say
04:58
nothing
04:59
because you're speaking against my plan
05:01
you don't know my ways and my thoughts
05:05
for the generations before him in his
05:07
line
05:08
paid a price with their life for the
05:09
kingdom
05:11
he could not escape being great
05:15
he's been thrown into this because i
05:17
called him into this
05:20
pray for him pray for everyone who he
05:22
chooses that he chooses by my will
05:26
but i will no longer tolerate the evil
05:30
the decay in this land i will no longer
05:34
that will not will not
05:38
tolerate the enemy trying to overtake my
05:42
country
05:44
for my name is written in its documents
05:48
for i was with those who wrote those
05:51
documents
05:52
even their names have been slandered and
05:55
lies told about them
05:57
i will not tolerate it
06:01
this is a new age i call it the kingdom
06:04
age it is time for my
06:07
people to lay down their differences
06:10
stop
06:11
your footing you are helping the enemy
06:15
i say in this day and age you come
06:18
together
06:19
for the world must see you loving each
06:21
other
06:22
you have to love each other first before
06:25
you can love others
06:27
my blessing falls on agreement
06:31
for those leaders in my house
06:35
my house not your house
06:40
my house it is mine and i am taking it
06:45
[Music]
06:46
back
06:48
those leaders in my house who are not
06:50
yielding my spirit
06:52
i will remove you
06:54
[Applause]
06:57
in this day it is critical that you work
06:59
together
07:00
that you love one another this is not
07:03
about you
07:04
being important this is not about you
07:07
becoming somebody
07:10
it's about you showing me my love
07:13
my truth my purposes my plans
07:18
lay down your plans and find out my
07:20
plans
07:22
because i choose to make america greater
07:25
than
07:26
ever was before i say
07:30
the world will race after the pattern
07:33
i'm going to put in america
07:36
i see the world run after the products
07:39
made
07:40
in america for i
07:44
have made america
07:48
it is mine many
07:51
have paid a price for this land
07:56
i will not overlook their blood crying
07:58
out
08:00
where is justice and liberty and freedom
08:04
i will not tolerate freedom being taken
08:07
from this land
08:10
that even the children cannot be saved
08:14
in their own schools
08:21
i will not tolerate it
08:25
you will see the hand of your god move
08:26
mightily in this land
08:31
i know i made this world i do not hate
08:34
the earth
08:36
i made it with my own hands
08:39
from my father spoke and anything you
08:43
spoke i created it
08:47
i even changed my very image
08:50
to come here and walk amongst you
08:54
i know your weaknesses
08:58
i know your hurts and your pains
09:03
i would no longer tolerate it in this
09:06
country
09:08
for light shall abound and the darkness
09:12
for generations shall be pushed back
09:16
regions of light and glory will be
09:19
created in this country
09:22
that sin and crime will not be able to
09:24
abide in
09:26
because i will erase even the very first
09:28
steps to the demonic who have threat
09:30
there
09:30
[Applause]
09:34
but you must stand up and decree and
09:36
declare
09:37
and make rulings for in this time my
09:40
kings
09:41
my spiritual kings will lay out decrees
09:44
and rulings and i will do them
09:47
because they will live holy and they
09:49
will obey
09:50
they will let me have my way
09:57
if you want to know me you must pursue
09:59
me
10:02
i do not control i lead
10:06
and i love but you cannot keep
10:10
insisting in heaven your own way you
10:13
can't have my will in your way it does
10:15
not work
10:18
because my father's kingdom my father's
10:21
kingdom the kingdom of heaven
10:23
is coming to this earth even now the
10:27
hosts
10:28
millions and millions of them have been
10:30
sent from heaven
10:32
to work with the believers to help
10:36
defend them and pull down the
10:37
strongholds
10:38
they are your weapon in this day and age
10:46
for i have chosen this time on the earth
10:51
my father has chosen this time on the
10:53
earth
10:55
you can either participate or you can
10:58
stand and watch it happen
11:00
but in eternity you will be so thankful
11:05
that you participated
11:08
i do not want to hear any more trashing
11:11
and bashing i don't want to hear evil
11:16
and wickedness and darkness coming out
11:18
of your mouth
11:19
if you say you are mine then stop it
11:23
for i have said this day i offer you
11:25
life and death
11:26
i said choose life because every time
11:29
you speak
11:30
death you will perish your soul will
11:34
perish
11:39
you must love but you must
11:42
share the truth you cannot embrace
11:46
the other false religions you are not
11:48
helping them
11:50
do not read their articles or their
11:52
doctrines
11:55
because they will clutter your soul
11:59
you read my word you live
12:03
by every word that is spoken
12:06
every spoken word you live by it
12:11
the written word is a guideline
12:14
but the spoken word never stops
12:17
revelation
12:18
is being released from heaven like never
12:20
before in this day
12:23
but the enemy also is releasing
12:26
deception
12:30
you do not want to be caught in
12:31
deception
12:36
you need to be free and full of me
12:40
you need to be dangerous against the
12:42
plans of darkness
12:44
for i created you perfectly and
12:47
amazingly
12:49

12:51

12:59
time of crisis

20:28
revelation of heaven

20:49
to go around this world
20:52
this is my earth and the fullness
20:55
thereof
20:57
and i am changing things because my
21:01
people
21:01

21:04
and i will come and heal their land and
21:07

22:24
whoa
22:37
can you bring my phone margaret
22:43
i love it when god confirms things
22:48
and he made a great distinction between
22:51
himself and the father didn't he
22:54
he wanted to know who he was
23:00
i made a little list of things i knew he
23:02
wanted me to talk about
23:04
and then most of this was already in the
23:06
songs of the decorations
23:09
and besides i didn't know he was going
23:11
to speak today i knew i would speak for
23:13
him
23:16
he came as the lord of glory and by the
23:19
way
23:20
that crown he wears his father took it
23:23
off his own head and put on his sunset
23:26
[Applause]
23:33
he was wearing that crown
23:38
i'll see if i can share a few of these
23:41
things
23:44
if i can remember how to operate this
23:45
right now
23:48
in heaven you wouldn't need this that
23:50
awesome
23:55
wow i knew he was coming when i saw that
23:58
angel
24:01
he's the head of his train when his
24:04
train his
24:05
train are the are the angels or the host
24:09
that's what makes up his garment
24:10
[Laughter]
24:15
i was really figured he was coming
24:18
because of the level of praise but when
24:20
i saw the angel standing outside
24:24
i knew he was coming i've been sitting i
24:27
sat in my sanctuary one time
24:29
and my pastor would always have me sit
24:31
on the front row so i could sketch
24:33
because i've always seen in the spirit
24:34
realm he had me sit there and draw
24:35
everything i saw in the spirit realm
24:36
during the service
24:39
and until one day when i was on the
24:41
floor
24:43
on the front row because jesus came in
24:46
his train
24:47
filled our sanctuary and then he came in
24:49
in his own
24:50
flaming chariot
24:54
and i was sitting on that front row
24:55
thinking he's gonna say something
24:59
and i mean his eyes were that flames of
25:01
fire his hair was white as wool
25:03
his garments were so brilliant i almost
25:06
couldn't look at them
25:07
and his chariot stopped and he got off
25:09
and came up to me i was on the floor
25:13
and he said you tell my people i only
25:16
came once a savior
25:18
when i come back i'm coming as king
25:31
[Applause]
25:32
and when he just spoke he was wearing
25:35
his crown
25:36
[Laughter]
25:39
he came as king today
25:42
[Music]
25:44
he wants our children to have a future
25:47
[Applause]
25:49
he wants our children to know how to
25:51
rule
25:55
kick the enemy out of their school
26:00
train the kids they won't ever forget it
26:05
he's serious i lost my notes
26:08
shaking i'm shaking
26:12
wow
26:15
i've seen the father come when he comes
26:19
his rainbow penetrates the building
26:21
before he ever gets there
26:24
i've seen him i've seen him come with
26:27
the living creatures the two
26:29
that carry his throne there's four
26:32
around his throne but there's two that
26:33
hold up the arms of his throne
26:36
they have four heads you know it talks
26:38
about the ones with the four hats
26:40
kneeling they're about 80 foot high
26:45
and their backs hold the armrest of the
26:48
father's throne
26:51
when it talks about the wheels the
26:53
wheels come out of them and they begin
26:55
to move and that throne
26:56
moves like this
27:02
yeah yeah he was talking about him
27:08
not humans talking
27:12
but they were talking to super natural
27:14
humans here today
27:16
and around the world if you belong to
27:18
him you're a supernatural
27:20
human not of this world
27:25
he reminded me last night you are the
27:27
aliens
27:32
he has repeatedly told me there are
27:35
no aliens
27:38
there's no other race out there that you
27:40
might happen chance
27:42
find in case you don't like heaven
27:46
there's heaven and there's the other
27:48
place
27:50
and after that if you choose that it's a
27:52
lake of fire
27:54
there's no other places to abide that's
27:56
right
27:58
i'm choosing into that i've seen the
28:02
other place you don't want to go there
28:09
i'm just going to keep sharing
28:12
this message is called made in america
28:17
so i am wearing america
28:23
i've always been very patriotic i have
28:26
voted in every election
28:28
from the time i was 18 i voted
28:32
your votes count you need to vote
28:36
[Music]
28:38
in this election you're going to vote
28:40
for light or darkness
28:42
there's no other platform
28:45
that's your choices you choose light or
28:49
darkness
28:52
i would say choose light
28:57
that same god that just spoke is about
28:59
to display himself
29:01
in signs and wonders around this world
29:03
that he will do himself
29:05
but there'll be ones that we do for him
29:12
this world has to see us doing those
29:13
supernatural things
29:15
because we belong to a supernatural god
29:17
[Applause]
29:20
you need to see it the true image of the
29:22
living god
29:24
one who loves the one who lives holy
29:27
and yet they have more fun in heaven
29:28
than they do on this earth
29:30
if you're going to live heaven culture
29:32
you have to have fun
29:35
he wants every intercessor to come out
29:37
of the closet
29:39
and you have fun before you go back in
29:44
because fun will be your greatest weapon
29:46
in this season
29:58
he said you need to have all night fun
29:59
parties
30:01
instead of all night prayer meetings
30:04
because when you come back for the
30:05
prayer meetings
30:06
there'll be a whole lot more powerful
30:08
than when you did it before the fun
30:13
this is a strange thing to the body of
30:16
christ
30:17
we thought they had to be serious and
30:19
profound well sirius and
30:21
went to sour somewhere it all went south
30:25
somewhere
30:26
[Applause]
30:28
because when the world hears a believer
30:29
they don't think wow fun
30:33
they don't think wow they love us wow
30:35
have you ever seen a group of people
30:37
that really cared about each other
30:39
that is not what they talk about
30:43
then i go man i want to be like them
30:47
but they will
30:49
[Music]
30:51
they will i saw a time in the earth when
30:53
people wanted
30:54
friends to be believers they wanted
30:56
believers for their friends
31:01
he said it sounds well but it will be
31:03
popular to be the friend of a believer
31:08
because jesus did that in his day
31:15
i like heavens playing better than ours
31:21
you can't leave the holy spirit out of
31:22
anything
31:24
amen i don't know if you know this but
31:28
in the baptist convention i may be
31:30
mistaken about the location
31:32
but i'm not mistaken about the
31:34
declaration
31:37
that they've had a meeting and someone
31:40
high up said
31:41
we can no longer resist ignore
31:44
or shut out the activities and the
31:46
receiving of the holy spirit
32:07
it literally was spoken
32:11
it was either at the beginning of this
32:13
year or the last part of last year
32:19
spoken to the highest hierarchy in the
32:21
baptist convention
32:25
i i believe i'm trying to remember this
32:27
correct i like to be correct but
32:28
somebody was sent out to do a survey
32:30
i don't know if it was to all the
32:31
missionaries it was somewhere specific
32:34
to look at
32:35
groups of what their people were doing
32:37
and they came back with a
32:38
shocking report they had all fallen
32:42
way behind because they visited many
32:45
missionary places
32:47
and the ones that were flourishing and
32:48
prospering were friends with the holy
32:54
spirit
32:56
and then they just looked in general
32:58
when they saw they began to look in
32:59
general just everywhere
33:01
and they were seriously shocked
33:04
and very concerned for their
33:07
denomination
33:09
so they really went to the whoever this
33:11
person was had the right and the
33:12
permission to speak to them
33:14
and they said we can no longer ignore
33:16
this we're going to fall behind everyone
33:19
else
33:20
and there's no life there's life where
33:22
the spirit is
33:28
they're being set up for the kingdom age
33:30
[Applause]
33:34
because you do know the holy spirit
33:35
moved his operations to planet earth
33:41
now he's still in heaven because he's
33:43
everywhere but he moved his operations
33:44
from heaven to earth
33:46
because jesus sent him here
33:52
all three of them
33:55
in the course of time are required
33:58
because of what they did for us
34:00
to move from heaven
34:04
people go where's that in the bible i
34:05
will tell you where it is in the bible
34:09
jesus was sent first the word
34:12
he was the word the host still call him
34:15
the word
34:16
they have worked closer with him than
34:18
almost any of the other angelic beings
34:20
because he is the lord of hosts he's the
34:23
lord of the host
34:27
he was involved in all the army
34:29
activities in heaven
34:31
when he used to fight for israel they
34:33
fought the human beings watch out
34:38
they did they did at that time they
34:42
fought the human beings
34:44
and and destroyed them angel
34:48
wiped out i forgot 185 000 something
34:50
like that it was crazy
34:53
they were god's chosen people they
34:55
represented him in this earth
34:57
they were in trouble of course evil and
35:00
wickedness
35:00
which is always controlled parts of this
35:02
earth and people on this earth
35:05
you know the devil can't do something
35:06
himself
35:08
he has to have a living soul to control
35:12
we've always said he needs the spirit
35:14
well he does he possesses the spirit
35:16
but he still has to have control of the
35:17
soul because the soul is what you act
35:20
with
35:21
it's what you think you choose and
35:23
display
35:24
that would be you that's why he wants to
35:28
destroy your soul
35:31
that's why god has given revelation on
35:33
the soul
35:34
you are a living soul that is a
35:38
powerful declaration that's one of the
35:41
things about being a little mini god
35:44
you know you're not that ye are gods
35:45
it's not some wild weird thing we're not
35:47
taking over heaven
35:49
we're not going to become god but we're
35:51
supposed to operate in the way they
35:52
operate
35:54
when they speak things happen when you
35:56
speak down here things are supposed to
35:58
happen
36:00
they have creative power why do you
36:01
think we create an event down here
36:04
we do it because that's their likeness
36:05
it's what they do
36:08
really it's not hard when you get
36:10
revelation of understanding of the
36:12
scriptures
36:13
that we were made in his image that
36:15
means he has a body
36:18
god hazard body the father has a body a
36:21
powerful body
36:23
he's magnificent his hair is white as
36:25
wool i i touch it sometimes when he
36:28
takes me up to the stone it's alive it's
36:29
living it's moving
36:30
everything in heaven has life in it it's
36:32
alive he wants our earth to be alive
36:35
he wants you to be alive we're supposed
36:38
to be carriers of life
36:40
because he carried life and centered
36:43
this earth
36:44
you're supposed to carry life
36:47
that's his image
36:50
the word was magnificent he was fully
36:54
spiritual he did not look like jesus
36:56
christ
36:59
he changed his very appearance
37:03
he didn't have flesh
37:07
the father put flesh on him like
37:10
melchizedek
37:11
had melchizedek has flesh
37:15
he's always had flesh he's ahead of a
37:18
whole tribe of angels that have flesh
37:21
before we were sent here angels are made
37:24
in tribes that's why there's tribes on
37:26
the earth
37:27
that's why there's tribes in israel
37:30
that wasn't a new thing god did the
37:32
angels are created in tribes
37:34
we had a whole tribe here today
37:39
you know tribe of the host here
37:43
god is very detailed and specific when
37:46
he makes anything
37:48
we need to be the same way
37:51
he likes to use the word strategic
37:55
he's very strategic in his plans right
37:57
now he's got strategy
37:59
laid out and designed
38:03
i've been shown the next couple hundred
38:05
years for america
38:09
it's gonna get a whole lot better
38:14
because when god steps in life comes
38:16
with him truth comes with him
38:19
creativity and blessings come with him
38:25
this habitation you have no way can you
38:28
even imagine in your mind or even myself
38:31
and all that i have seen and been shown
38:33
and i've seen supernatural shocking
38:35
amazing things but even i
38:37
cannot contain the scope of what is
38:40
going to happen through this habitation
38:43
and it's starting in this generation of
38:45
people
38:46
it's a typing group of people we're that
38:50
type and group of people right now
38:51
because
38:51
you know why you're alive right now
38:54
that's why you're included
38:56
he timed your birth on the earth to be a
38:58
part of this
39:01
some of you may not have any idea what
39:03
i'm talking about
39:04
i'm talking for god this is how he talks
39:09
he has a plan follow his plan
39:13
you have to know him to do this
39:16
okay you can't go out there and rule and
39:17
reign over the darkness if you don't
39:19
know jesus christ
39:21
remember the seven sons of skeva
39:24
that was a bad day that was a bad choice
39:28
and there were seven of them not one
39:31
they thought they could use his name
39:33
and take over demons they got overtaken
39:37
they probably never tried that again
39:41
you're not going to get away with saying
39:43
you're using the power of god on this
39:45
day
39:48
his name is holy
39:52
but this is also a day of greatness
39:56
and excitement and celebration
39:59
and i've learned something from the
40:01
father if i do not celebrate every day
40:03
of my life what i do
40:05
i might become weary sometimes it's hard
40:09
work
40:10
it's wonderful work it's amazing work
40:13
i don't have a life because i gave it to
40:15
him
40:18
you know it's easy to celebrate god and
40:21
the vision
40:22
when i'm alone with him but i have to
40:25
live with people
40:29
who are not on the level i'm on and i
40:32
want them to be there
40:34
don't drag them there it does not
40:39
work i'm learning to love my family
40:44
until god can change them and deal with
40:46
them it's not my job
40:48
to deal with them i cannot stop
40:52
and fix everything for everybody out
40:54
there that i hear from and it pulls on
40:57
my heart
40:58
because i love people but i cannot fix
41:00
you
41:01
i give you revelation if you apply it
41:04
then god's power will fix you
41:08
god will not let me do personal ministry
41:11
don't call my office and ask for it and
41:13
then say i'm mean and ugly because i
41:14
won't do it
41:16
this is what god said if you obey it
41:19
will all be
41:19
okay i am not going to disobey him
41:24
i wasn't called to be in the five-fold
41:26
ministry i'm not a pastor hallelujah
41:29
bless every pastor on the earth god i
41:31
want
41:32
supernatural blessings this day to begin
41:35
to fall on their sacrifice they've given
41:37
their life for
41:38
they've been bitten by sheep spitting by
41:41
sheep
41:42
talk bad about sheep
41:46
keep going yes i will
41:49
they've been abandoned and rejected by
41:51
sheep laughed at by sheep
41:53
even the clothes they where they picked
41:55
on the way they designed the church they
41:57
picked at it
41:58
they've pointed fingers at their family
42:00
when their own family is in deep trouble
42:04
you sheep straighten up amen because
42:07
when you're in trouble guess who you
42:08
call to help rescue you
42:10
[Music]
42:12
don't love your pastor when they come to
42:14
rescue already be loving them
42:16
it'll be a pleasure to rescue you
42:18
[Applause]
42:23
honor needs i tell you heaven culture
42:27
honor there's love and honor honor is
42:29
the second biggest thing in heaven
42:31
culture
42:33
you have to honor each other
42:37
don't fight over what you don't believe
42:39
or agree on talk about what you do
42:41
[Music]
42:42
every single one of you have gifts and
42:44
god put them in there
42:46
we need each other we are not an
42:49
island to ourselves you cannot
42:52
isolate yourself when you isolate
42:56
yourself
42:57
now i'm not talking about when god calls
42:59
you away to himself
43:01
he does that he used to do it to me all
43:02
the time but i still had to come back in
43:04
the mass
43:05
and the tribe i lived in and love them
43:08
and care about them
43:10
not everyone in my family is happy about
43:13
me
43:16
no is that is that amazing
43:22
i'd have to say half of them are excited
43:23
the other half don't care
43:27
someone come correct me i just love them
43:30
i ask god to bless them
43:32
i have their face at my war room and i
43:34
loose the holy spirit on them all the
43:38
time
43:40
then there are some who are part of what
43:41
i do
43:43
then i gotta be there one-on-one with
43:45
them
43:48
where they learn to guard their soul and
43:49
lose stuff from their soul
43:53
this is a new time on the earth we need
43:56
to live
43:57
a new way okay you need to be like jesus
44:02
he changed his very appearance
44:06
the holy spirit was very close to him
44:12
before the earth was made and they got
44:14
consumed with all of us
44:16
they would do things together there's a
44:17
whole area
44:19
beyond heaven i call it the retreat
44:24
even they need to get away sometimes
44:28
that's why you need to do that when god
44:31
calls you apart to be with him that's
44:32
one thing
44:33
but getting away just to have fun is
44:35
something that's just as necessary
44:38
have fun with your family for heaven's
44:40
sakes they need to see some fun
44:44
let's all say this father i ask for it
44:48
and receive funds
44:52
to have fun when it comes
44:56
i'll use it to have fun because that's
45:00
why you're sending it
45:07
we are his children we can ask more than
45:09
just our basic needs being met
45:13
you have not because you asked not
45:16
people always think that's
45:18
the spiritual side of everything but we
45:20
live in a physical realm
45:22
in these physical bodies it needs to
45:24
have a break you need to take a break
45:27
even jesus took a break from the
45:29
disciples of heaven's name he needed it
45:33
hard-headed i know what it's like to
45:36
live with fishermen
45:39
[Laughter]
45:45
i know in scottish fishermen
45:52
i know the scottish ways very well
45:54
[Applause]
45:56
and i'm irish and jewish
46:02
whoa what a dynamite
46:11
yeah it was quite interesting we'll be
46:12
married 40 years next year
46:16
it's been a wild journey
46:18
[Applause]
46:19
marriage is bliss in the good times
46:26
in the fun times always
46:30
that's why god sends the angels on
46:33
assignment with the opposite kind of
46:35
personality
46:39
they're not given a marriage nor married
46:41
they are not
46:42
unhappy about that
46:46
the ones that chose it before on the
46:48
earth have regretted it ever since
46:56
but he'll send the serious ones with the
46:57
comedians
47:00
there are comedian angels i have met
47:03
some
47:07
they're the ones that give you those
47:08
awesome jokes to tell
47:11
that's them
47:12
[Music]
47:14
that's that's who they are and they do
47:17
it on assignment and the holy one
47:20
profound one does not want to hear the
47:21
jokes they are focused on their
47:23
assignment well so is the other one he's
47:24
just enjoying it while he's on
47:25
it
47:29
they sharpen each other
47:33
and then god makes it even better he
47:35
sends them home on sabbatical to have
47:37
fun at the front
47:38
at the playport they have a playport
47:41
it's in the sky
47:42
then they have to go and have fun
47:44
together
47:46
after they completed their assignment
47:48
[Music]
47:50
together
47:52
you're going to get a whole new view i'm
47:53
going to come and just speak about
47:54
angels one time
47:55
you will laugh most of the time and then
47:58
you will pray for them
48:06
i'm gonna keep reading i'm listening
48:12
if i ever write people go you need to
48:14
write a book of angels if i did it won't
48:16
be what you expect
48:22
we'll have the section holy profound the
48:24
fun
48:27
they have them i'm going to just start
48:30
sharing what he said he wanted me to
48:32
talk about how he made america
48:35
and the people who made america great
48:38
god's always had people and he would he
48:42
would assign them he would anoint them
48:43
is that strange
48:45
he anointed people that weren't even
48:46
believers
48:49
he gives anointings the anointing draws
48:53
people
48:56
and that's why people have the ability
48:57
to influence people
48:59
it's an anointing sometimes the enemy
49:01
gets ahold of those people and they
49:03
are anointed still anointed he doesn't
49:06
take the anointing away
49:07
but then it draws people to the darkness
49:10
and that's why we have so many dark
49:12
movies and dark songs
49:14
because they have darkness in them
49:16
because if they were filled with light
49:17
that same anointing would create
49:19
amazing fantastic things that's why he's
49:21
getting hollywood saved
49:24
[Applause]
49:24
[Music]
49:28
i'll be going there next month
49:30
[Music]
49:32
i have a key to hollywood a key to l.a
49:36
actually
49:37
he even showed me the seven golden
49:39
angels that stand around
49:41
uh la
49:44
the ones that the city was named for
49:47
[Music]
49:49
los angeles the city of angels
49:54
the first time i went i saw them and
49:56
this person who brought me started
49:58
taking me to significant places so i
49:59
could tell what i saw in the spirit
50:00
realm
50:02
i saw those seven angels they were
50:03
taller than mountains
50:06
and they had these vials standing over
50:08
the city waiting to pour them
50:11
and they poured them before i left
50:14
because god had was pouring out an
50:16
anointing on hollywood
50:18
to help show the truth and bring light
50:21
and change the producers directors the
50:24
scriptwriters the special effects people
50:26
[Applause]
50:29
hollywood is right
50:31
[Music]
50:31
[Applause]
50:33
they'll still make intense exciting
50:35
adventurous
50:36
funny movies but it will not have
50:39
darkness or evil in it
50:41
and if it has evil they'll be overcome
50:43
and defeated by the good in there
50:46
not everyone will be a bible movie but
50:49
the whole
50:49
the whole life of heaven and what god
50:52
wants to be seen and lived on the earth
50:54
will be portrayed in every movie
50:57
there'll be goodness there'll be power
50:58
there'll be light there'll be hope
51:00
in all of them
51:03
yes the blessed coast
51:08
and so yeah a lot of stuff was planted
51:10
in california i laugh every time i hear
51:12
a prophet say it's going to fall off the
51:13
face of the earth
51:15
i just saw it fall off into the ocean
51:18
went well you didn't see a literal thing
51:21
you must have seen the darkness falling
51:23
off into the ocean
51:25
[Applause]
51:28
he's always had people in america that
51:31
would make america great
51:33
our forefathers were some of those we
51:35
grew up
51:36
we my age grew up in school knowing the
51:40
truth about them
51:41
and what they did for our country
51:45
and they always talked about god they
51:47
talked about god we prayed every day in
51:49
school
51:50
remember those days in the public school
51:51
we prayed
51:52
[Music]
51:55
that's because god created america
51:58
and then he anointed people who paid for
52:01
america to be great
52:04
people have usually talked down the
52:05
people where great wealth those people
52:07
great wealth help build this country
52:10
they're people who built whole states
52:13
they founded host states the beginning
52:14
of host states
52:16
but two very wealthy people who founded
52:18
almost all of florida
52:20
and paid for all the universities and
52:22
the hospitals and the great places and
52:24
uh many the beautiful structures and
52:26
buildings they were they were paid for
52:27
for about two by two people
52:31
so he would he would choose people with
52:33
great wealth and anoint them and have
52:34
the wealth
52:35
because they put it back in the country
52:38
he's going to do that again
52:41
he's already he's already picked up
52:43
people to do that
52:45
and then god said in america i mean you
52:48
the people he meet the people in america
52:53
and he said then i set up a miracle i'd
52:54
be run by the people for the people
52:58
he put those words in there that was him
53:00
to have freedom of liberty
53:02
to worship him to separate the uh
53:05
the um the government from interfering
53:08
with the church
53:10
not the other way around separation of
53:12
church and state
53:14
church is first separate church
53:17
so the state cannot interfere with it
53:23
that's true then what he himself talked
53:27
about the gospel
53:28
he had me put in there the notes i had
53:30
already he already given me
53:32
two-thirds of the gospel that's not for
53:34
me that's from him
53:36
was paid for by people in america
53:41
other countries were involved they
53:43
always happened great revivals happened
53:45
the welsh revival
53:46
there's so many in scotland where my
53:49
husband's from the covenanters
53:51
those people were the holy people in
53:53
scotland
53:54
they were powerful powerful people in
53:57
ireland i can't even begin to tell you
53:58
about ireland with colombo and patrick
54:01
and
54:02
they had friends of angels angels were
54:04
their friends
54:06
and they didn't worship them they sent
54:07
them on assignments
54:09
bangor island ireland to this day
54:12
is called the valley of the angels
54:17
and they still see these luminous angels
54:20
in that place
54:22
because of the price people paid to pay
54:25
theirs so they had prices paid somewhere
54:27
in our own country there was a 100-year
54:30
non-stop prayer meeting
54:35
and people would work for each other
54:37
just as they could be in this this cycle
54:39
of prayer
54:39
they were crying out for god to come to
54:41
this country and do something
54:42
a 100 years before we were here before
54:46
we who were sitting here were here
54:48
they did that people have always paid a
54:51
price
54:52
here in america died many of them died
54:54
even in the founding of it
54:59
and then he made america to stand as
55:02
israel's friend
55:03
i already had that in my notes to stand
55:06
and be a friend of israel
55:09
and sometimes we weren't always that
55:10
friend but that is going to change
55:13
[Applause]
55:16
it will change many things will change
55:20
he said i established and made and
55:22
birthed in america
55:23
america is different from almost any
55:25
other nation
55:27
it is that's why they all want to come
55:28
here
55:30
and i know they love there's some that
55:32
love where they are but people who
55:33
really want
55:34
true freedom and liberty they come here
55:36
for that liberty and freedom
55:37
there's a lot of very good moral people
55:40
that come here because they know they
55:41
can live
55:43
they're not coming here so they can be
55:44
beat up and die
55:46
they're coming here to actually have a
55:48
life
55:50
yes and to get born again they're going
55:53
to get born again
55:55
i've seen i've already been shown
55:57
millions at a time will run into the
55:59
kingdom
55:59
[Applause]
56:01
millions of muslims will run into the
56:03
kingdom
56:04
[Applause]
56:08
he didn't tell me that he showed me that
56:17
he he he cannot ignore who ishmael was
56:22
in case you wondered this where that
56:23
whole thing came from
56:26
he's not gonna he's not gonna ignore
56:27
ishmael and who his father was
56:30
right he said
56:34
he even said they would be mighty in the
56:36
land
56:37
and they are they need to know the true
56:41
god
56:43
he said he birthed in america and made
56:46
in america liberty and freedom to
56:48
worship god in america
56:50
more freedom in america than any other
56:52
country if you don't believe that go
56:54
visit the other countries
56:59
there's more churches in america than
57:01
anywhere someone came to our town i
57:02
think we have like a thousand
57:06
they came for the super bowl one
57:08
thousand volunteers were all from the
57:10
churches
57:12
they had a plan
57:15
most places that uh the super bowl comes
57:19
they have all these party zones
57:21
everywhere
57:22
i mean everywhere's party party not the
57:24
good kind of party
57:26
and very little things for families we
57:28
had
57:29
mass family zones all over our city
57:33
for all the people who came to the super
57:35
bowl so they could have fun with their
57:36
families
57:37
we had one little tiny area downtown
57:40
somewhere that was the other
57:41
party zone and the super bowl committee
57:45
said they would come back
57:47
they had never seen such harmony and
57:50
unity
57:51
between the volunteers and the people in
57:53
the city
57:54
and they were so excited about the the
57:56
thing that we welcomed all the families
57:58
we had stuff at the beach we had stuff
58:00
for the
58:00
on the river all over our city family
58:02
zones
58:05
when god is in your city it is what
58:07
happens
58:09
amen and then he said i'm going to share
58:12
some of the i'm going to give some of
58:14
the first for america
58:15
it's important to know about your
58:16
country our military
58:22
i i love that you were blowing
58:25
was that the bugle what were you blowing
58:27
yeah
58:28
that was so god
58:32
because i already had down here to talk
58:34
about the military
58:36
my boy this whole group is just they're
58:39
all
58:39
hearing what was in my notes or what he
58:43
said himself
58:45
if you don't have a church in this area
58:46
come here
58:52
he said the military he said i birthed
58:55
and patterned the military here after
58:57
heaven's military
59:00
they have a military they have an army
59:05
michael that's his job in heaven
59:08
he's the archangel over the host he has
59:11
a military headquarters in heaven
59:14
they have barracks 200 and some feet
59:16
high
59:19
i couldn't see the end of those barracks
59:24
and they were designed and created for
59:26
one thing
59:28
to destroy the actions of the army of
59:31
darkness
59:33
so they didn't have a job for a long
59:35
time
59:39
and now until lucifer decided to take
59:41
over they didn't know what they were
59:42
going to be doing
59:45
they sure did their maneuvers really
59:46
well
59:50
and it's not a tourist attraction in
59:52
heaven by the way
59:54
people go there they don't stay long
59:59
they're far too busy to stop and chat
60:01
with you
60:04
so now they've all been sent down here
60:07
isn't that exciting for them
60:14
said our military was raised up to care
60:18
to care not just for this country
60:22
but other countries
60:26
he said america has gone and defended
60:28
almost
60:29
all the other world leader countries
60:32
that stood for justice and freedom
60:36
even the small ones who had nobody
60:39
even the smallest countries they went
60:41
there
60:43
even if they weren't thanked they went
60:45
there
60:47
because we we don't like injustice
60:50
our military my husband is a marine he
60:53
will always be a marine
60:56
he forgets embarks order sometimes i
60:58
don't listen to them
61:01
if i get a kiss i will listen
61:03
[Music]
61:03
[Applause]
61:06
i am not your squadron do i look
61:10
like a squadron
61:13
i will show up in fatigues if that's
61:16
what you want me to wear i will wear
61:17
them all the time
61:20
you want me to look like this then i
61:22
better get a kiss
61:24
[Applause]
61:26
[Music]
61:30
if you think god just lets me run up and
61:31
ignore my husband you
61:33
are so wrong you need to get our dvd and
61:36
cd called passionate power
61:40
yep it was something he had me activate
61:44
no my husband i have to make him happy
61:47
make him feel important and let him have
61:48
a good time and fish as much as he wants
61:50
to
61:52
even though he smells like bait
61:56
i celebrate when he catches a fish
62:00
and when i'm gone he sends me a picture
62:02
every day
62:06
that's his gift
62:12
so god designed uh our military he wants
62:15
he wants us to have a strong military
62:17
because as long as evil wicked people in
62:19
the world that want to just kill
62:21
destroy you have to have that strength
62:24
as part of your protection
62:26
and protection for others and he said
62:29
they stood the
62:30
our military stands for uh righteousness
62:33
which
62:34
means uh in order to be in the military
62:37
uh tell you they deal with those who are
62:39
not
62:40
keeping their self in order because when
62:43
you're
62:43
in the military you live military you
62:46
represent the military
62:49
as they find out too much stuff is going
62:50
on you are in trouble
62:53
they want you to live right because you
62:56
know that's why you're there to fight
62:57
right so righteousness justice and
62:59
liberty is really the hallmark
63:02
of our military we need to honor them
63:04
more they're going to be respected in
63:05
ways we've never seen before
63:07
in the future one other
63:10
one other thing and and actually the
63:13
father
63:14
absolutely loves nasa
63:18
because they show us all of his space
63:21
art
63:23
nasa introduced for the first time to
63:25
this world god's art
63:27
in outer space maybe you never thought
63:29
of it that way
63:30
that's how he thinks of it it's not a
63:33
bunch of dust particles that came
63:34
together
63:36
he designed every one of those nebulas
63:39
spoke them into existence and then the
63:41
lord of glory made them
63:44
the word stepped out and made them
63:47
every one of them is put in a specific
63:49
place
63:51
that's why the planets aren't all
63:52
falling out of the sky
63:55
and by the way there's a difference in
63:58
using the word universe
63:59
and the word cosmos
64:04
universe is just the universe
64:07
it is not necessarily made by divine
64:09
design
64:11
but the word cosmos means a creator
64:15
designed it and made it
64:18
[Applause]
64:20
the bible calls it the cosmos
64:25
man came up with universe same thing
64:29
but it is the cosmos designed by
64:33
a creator and perfect design
64:37
i like that word cosmic we're going to
64:39
have some cosmic times on this earth
64:42
[Music]
64:43
nasa was birthed here in america and
64:46
made in america
64:48
the greatest place space exploration
64:51
facility in the world was in america
64:55
other countries pursued it
64:56
but america made it a part of them it
64:59
was also funded and paid for
65:01
by the people in america we paid for all
65:05
that stuff that went on and it meant
65:07
something
65:08
because it wasn't just discovering new
65:10
places and images there were so many
65:12
things
65:12
created just in the course of making
65:14
that possible
65:15
that we all enjoy now new technology we
65:19
never had before
65:20
new products we never had before on the
65:22
earth that increased safety
65:24
and excitement and let me tell you just
65:26
if you've never looked at those
65:28
galleries you need to go online to
65:30
nasa.com
65:32
which now get this since the space
65:35
exploration with humans is done they're
65:37
still setting the hubble and the other
65:39
one out there
65:40
we're learning more and more about what
65:42
god made out there
65:44
so they're not they haven't stopped
65:45
doing something if you ever go to the
65:47
nasa center in florida
65:49
it has turned into a huge facility where
65:51
you can tour it learn things
65:52
experience things see things they even
65:54
have kids space camp
65:57
to be a junior astronaut so they've not

66:02
but they have released 99
66:06
of all the photos for free
66:10
and you can get them and put them on
66:12

if you want something that's high def
66:21
and you're going to use it for something
66:22
specific
66:23
you may pay a little bit for it but most
66:25
of it because the people
66:26
paid for it they gave it to us how about
66:28
that
66:30
so that was something that was made in
66:31
america a first in america was nasa
66:34
and then he said some of the greatest
66:35
inventions and scientists were homegrown
66:38
in america
66:39
or america drew some of the greatest to
66:41
our country because of the freedom and
66:42
liberty they had
66:44
to create and we have worked closely
66:47
with israel and their brilliant
66:48
minds that god gave them and some of our
66:51
creativity
66:52
worked together to bring things to this
66:54
country and this time god will bring
66:56

68:09
just give her one check so she doesn't
68:11
have a whole bunch of checksuits
68:14
god is uh one another thing made in
68:17
america or birth in america
68:19
is the revelation and details about the
68:22
kingdom age
68:25
is coming from me i live here
68:29
details on heaven culture and how to
68:31
live that
68:32
how to work with the host of heaven as
68:34
your weapon
68:36
and i know it's happening in other
68:37
places but the fullness of the
68:39
of the revelation and the detail on it
68:42
he is birthing here from america as a
68:45
pattern
68:46
we will be a pattern the believers who
68:49
live here will be a pattern
68:51
for the other believers to run after
68:52
that same pattern
68:54
because then they will prosper and
68:55
flourish and push back darkness
68:59
god always raises up a type of people
69:01
when he introduces something new in the
69:03
earth
69:03
we're it that's why you're sitting here
69:07
that's why you're hearing these words
69:11
so he's birthing the kingdom age the
69:14
fullness and understanding of it jesus
69:16
introduced it
69:17
but we've never really seen the fullness
69:19
of the kingdom or even
69:20
understood what it was it's in
69:24
all of you if jesus christ lives in you
69:28
because he's an orchestrator of the
69:29
kingdom age he releases it from you
69:32
it's a lifestyle it's a lifestyle you
69:35
live in this earth
69:37
prospering and using it to build this
69:39
kingdom or take this message of the
69:40
kingdom
69:41
because the message of the kingdom has
69:43
power in it yeah it does
69:47
it's the gospel parents grab your
69:49
children parents grab your children
69:50
there
69:51
get your children
69:56
it's releasing revelation
69:59
as a pattern to follow to rule and reign
70:02
with christ
70:03
to use our powerful weapons including
70:05
the host of heaven
70:07
remember they're bored they have nothing
70:08
to do they are not defending heaven
70:12
they didn't even do anything about when
70:14
lucifer fell and one-third of the angels
70:16
god himself kicked him out
70:20
he's always reminding the devil you have
70:22
lost yeah
70:24
[Applause]
70:25
then his son reminded them in hell on
70:27
the third day when he wasted them
70:30
[Music]
70:31
he wasted them in hell demonstrated that
70:34
not only he had power and authority
70:36
but all those who follow him have the
70:38
same power and authority that he
70:41
lived in it is ours
70:44
now it's our time to demonstrate through
70:47
our life
70:47
and receiving and choosing this
70:49
lifestyle we will demonstrate that same
70:52
authority and power over
70:53
all the power of the darkness
70:56
it's because this is a new time
71:00
this is exciting i'm ex i'm getting
71:03
excited yes
71:05
he said he said um
71:12
because of what america has stood for
71:15
and was created for to bless the world
71:18
to be a light to the nations to become
71:22
a pattern of heaven on this earth
71:26
that is all of our calling to represent
71:30
heaven on this earth
71:32
it's wonderful to live in heaven but if
71:35
it's not your time
71:36
you are not going anywhere
71:39
[Applause]
71:42
our life spans are going to be extended
71:45
in the kingdom age
71:47
because we are that generation and type
71:50
of people
71:50
that will taste to the i'm talking about
71:54
the power when jesus
71:55
lives on the earth and sits in jerusalem
71:58
on the throne
71:59
man's lifespan will be extended for
72:01
hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
72:03
years
72:04
but there will be a generation on the
72:06
earth a taste of that
72:08
the power of that age well there's only
72:11
one more age after this one it's the
72:13
millennial age
72:14
so we are that people that will
72:15
experience and taste of the powers
72:17
of the age to come so everybody stand up
72:20
please
72:27
that's why you are so important to god
72:31
and the people around the world that
72:34
belong to him
72:34
you are important to god we are to
72:38
represent heaven
72:39
live heaven culture in this earth
72:41
operate like christ did on this earth
72:44
to bring hope jesus brought hope god is
72:50
not the author of doom and gloom
72:53
it is not time he could not possibly put
72:56
his wrath right now because we wouldn't
72:59
be able to do the things he wants us to
73:01
do
73:03
this is not the end of the end
73:07
it's not the perilous times this is some
73:09
of the greatest times on this earth
73:14
oh we are totally getting the wealth of
73:16
the wicked
73:20
there's many ways he's going to do that
73:21
i know one of the ways that we will do
73:23
that
73:24
is by the things we put in the
73:25
marketplace that they can't create and
73:27
they don't have
73:28
they will race after those things in the
73:30
marketplace
73:32
i was sitting there today and you said
73:34
the world will race after
73:36
made in america products
73:38
[Applause]
73:40
especially china
73:46
i don't know how they feel about that
73:49
[Applause]
73:52
i can't leave without telling you to be
73:54
very
73:55
careful about what you're buying
73:59
check out what you're buying make sure
74:01
it's a good product
74:03
make sure it's not going to fall apart
74:04
or explode
74:08
there's other countries that have been
74:09
allowed to bring things into our
74:11
countries that have no guidelines for
74:12
their products
74:14
not even their own people are protected
74:17
and they're putting they are they're
74:20
putting asbestos
74:21
in formaldehyde and let
74:25
even in toys you can get a little i'm
74:28
just telling y'all the truth okay
74:30
you can get a tester you can buy a
74:31
little tester i don't know where it is
74:33
sometimes they give them away free
74:34
probably go online and look for them i
74:36
i'd go in the store and i would look at
74:38
everything
74:39
i'm not doing that to put fear in you
74:40
i'm telling you that to protect yourself
74:42
and your children
74:44
that's why we need stuff made here
74:48
now other countries like england and
74:51
france and
74:52
italy and other countries are other good
74:54
solid countries that make
74:56
amazing products that have guidelines
74:58
for their materials
75:00
but there's others that have started
75:01
flooding the marketplace
75:03
that have no guidelines and they
75:04
shouldn't allow them in here
75:06
without checking them out they should
75:07
have to have the same guidelines
75:09
do you agree i'm sure everyone agrees
75:13
but people are not aware that almost 80
75:15
percent of all the products on the
75:16
shelves
75:17
are not good things
75:20
i look at every label it takes a while
75:24
even some of the food now is being sent
75:26
overseas to be processed
75:27
i will give you a tip organic farms will
75:30
explode in america
75:35
organic farms if you can go organic go
75:38
organic
75:40
they don't use pesticides they don't use
75:42
fillers they don't use
75:44
hormones in the in the meat and in the
75:46
animals
75:47
you know a long time ago they didn't
75:49
really do all that until they wanted to
75:51
start
75:51
mass producing stuff well one of the
75:54
things that will be changing in america
75:56
is the way we process
75:57
stuff even ourselves is going to get
75:59
better
76:01
i'm not telling you not to eat i'm just
76:03
telling you be
76:04
be aware of where you're buying stuff
76:06
they have organic markets
76:09
and if they don't have them you contact
76:11
them and tell them to bring them here
76:14
we actually ate at an organic restaurant
76:16
in denver
76:18
it's called mod market i'm giving them a
76:20
free commercial
76:21
fresh from the farm and the i think
76:24
the mills mall it's near that uh
76:28
that restaurant that has the bony fish
76:30
on it
76:34
i won't be going there if you like fish
76:37
go there
76:39
but we ate there and the food was
76:40
delicious and it was fresh all of it was
76:42
fresh
76:43
so it is increasing if you if you see
76:46
organic
76:47
you know make sure it's a responsible
76:49
company but organic farms are going to
76:51
explode because there is a generation
76:54
my two of my daughters fall in that 30
76:56
year old category
76:58
and they refuse to give any of their
77:00
children anything that is not
77:04
they eat healthy they are healthy and
77:07
every now and then they let them
77:08
splurge you know they don't say you
77:11
can't ever have a pizza
77:12
but if they do they get an organic one
77:16
learn to make them yourself
77:19
because you can buy stuff and make good
77:20
stuff amen
77:22
i don't know where that came from i
77:23
guess god cares he cares about you
77:26
but our marketplace will majorly
77:30

00:00
everybody i hope you're having a great
00:02
day we
00:03
are right here in sunny florida
00:06
and yes it's actually sunny by the way
00:08
that system
00:10
that the weather warriors took authority
00:11
over last night is like gone
00:13
gone it's gone so thank you everybody
00:16
for participating
00:18
and because all of this that we do
00:20
belongs to god we're going to start
00:22
with everyone out there asking for grace
00:25
so you're going to learn something
00:26
before we start our q a session
00:28
you actually should do this when you
00:30
first wake up in the morning i'm talking
00:32
about grace for abundant
00:33
life maybe you never heard about that
00:36
but it's definitely
00:37
in the bible there's actually a
00:40
scripture
00:41
which you know that should be maybe a
00:44
homework assignment for everyone who's a
00:46
part of this
00:46
there's a scripture that says god said
00:50
as a child i filled my son with my grace
00:54
now this is god the father speaking it's
00:56
in the word of god
00:58
he is also the one who has the throne of
01:00
grace
01:02
jesus christ gives grace for abundant
01:04
life
01:06
god gives grace god jesus
01:11
you all know of course that i'm up very
01:13
early i didn't wear my shirt that says
01:16
you know what does it say i'm not a
01:18
morning person i'm not a morning person
01:20
and i know you're like weirded out by
01:22
this but this is my morning
01:24
right now this is my morning okay now if
01:27
you
01:28
called me at six am i probably wouldn't
01:30
even have gone to bed yet
01:31
so i'm doing this because i love you so
01:34
christ
01:35
gives grace for eternal life
01:38
that's eternal life grace that's when he
01:41
died on the cross he gave we got that
01:43
but the father who sits on the throne of
01:46
grace come before my throne of grace
01:49
to find grace for help in time of need
01:52
that is abundant life grace and you know
01:55
there's an action it says find it that
01:57
means you come and you
01:59
ask for it so as a child
02:02
god the father filled his son with his
02:05
grace for abundant life
02:06
is one of the things that helped him
02:09
survive on this earth okay
02:11
that's how he could still be happy
02:12
filled with god in heaven
02:15
abundant life grace is fueled from
02:18
heaven
02:20
if you will look up to heaven every
02:21
morning when you wake up and you say
02:23
father i ask for
02:24
and receive grace for this day
02:27
like right now i feel it it feels like
02:30
light electricity pouring
02:31
into me a lot of people don't know this
02:34
is something you can actually
02:36
get every day and it's like new every
02:40
day
02:41
and so we're all going to do this
02:42
together so everybody even here
02:44
in the studio say it after i do so
02:46
everybody can know they have to do it
02:48
father father i ask for
02:52
i ask for and receive grace and receive
02:55
grace
02:55
for this day for this day amen
02:59
amen there you go
03:02
now we are all filled with grace what
03:05
does that mean that means you're going
03:06
to be happy
03:07
things aren't going to be bothering you
03:09
for whatever you're going to go through
03:11
that day you just got grace for that so
03:14
you could live
03:15
abundantly because christ comes to bring
03:17
life
03:19

03:23
today and i talk to you just like you
03:26
right here in front of me
03:27
and being 1 to 15 i have no problem
03:30
communicating with
03:32
people and i love people because you
03:34
know i survived them
03:36
was triumphant living with that whole
03:38
family with our alligator in the bathtub
03:40
and you know umpteen toad frogs that my
03:43
seven brothers would go out and collect
03:45
and my mom would have to set them free
03:47
every night
03:48
um so we definitely had a different
03:50
household so i love all of you
03:52
if you're bashing trash you know we're
03:54
gonna have to we're gonna have to ban
03:56
you
03:57
um but we love you anyway so i'll say
04:00
that right in the beginning i love
04:01
everybody even those who don't want that
04:02
you don't understand
04:05
don't be filled with fear that god has
04:07
more
04:09
and it's called revelation so that's
04:10
what you're going to get today
04:12
as we answer these questions that you
04:14
are asking and jen will take a couple
04:17
from the comments you know we're gonna
04:19
we're gonna we've already got a few that
04:20
we're gonna answer because we've been
04:22
promising a long time so we're gonna get
04:23
started
04:25
so uh and i do have a few more things to
04:27
share later but right now we're going to
04:28
start the q a session
04:31
awesome let's have it jan we are ready
04:34
you guys can't see me but i'm over here
04:36
off to the side
04:38
hi okay um all right so this question
04:43
is from
04:47
sharon it doesn't say where she's from
04:50
okay sharon yes and uh she would like to
04:53
know that
04:54
since there is no night time in heaven
04:58
are there bedrooms in your mansion
05:01
okay i'm sure everybody heard that but
05:03
this is from sharon a question from
05:05
sharon she wants to know
05:07
since there's no nighttime in heaven i
05:09
don't know if you knew that but there
05:11
isn't
05:12
you know there's no shadow turning
05:13
there's no darkness at all and having
05:15
the
05:15
there's different colors that come in
05:17
the sky different times well there's not
05:19
time in heaven
05:21
just waves of color come to the sky of
05:24
heaven which would
05:24
sort of change the effect of the light
05:27
coming
05:28
from god himself all light in heaven
05:31
comes from god there's no
05:32
sun there's no moon in heaven so there's
05:35
always
05:36
daylight there's always light and you
05:38
don't have per se
05:39
a bedroom in your mansion because no
05:42
one's going to be sleeping
05:43
you do have special rooms in your
05:45
mansion where they have beautiful
05:46
lounges for you to lounge on
05:48
sometimes people want to go in there and
05:50
and you still go and set yourself apart
05:52
to read the word
05:54
and even though god is everywhere in
05:55
heaven his presence is with you some
05:57
people just go to a special place in
05:59
their mansion
06:00
and just have conversations with him
06:02
sometimes your special friends visit you
06:05
and so you do have like the most
06:06
beautiful place
06:08
the most comfortable place in your
06:09
mansion would probably be like
06:11
your area where you're going to lounge
06:13
and relax
06:15
and so but per se is a bed you don't
06:17
need that
06:18
and people think how lovely and
06:20
wonderful well let me give you a clue in
06:22
the nurseries with the millions of
06:24
babies there's many nurseries all over
06:25
heaven
06:27
they don't sleep either can you imagine
06:30
being on the list to be one of the
06:32
angels that
06:34
care for these little babies and you
06:36
have to play with them all the time
06:37
because
06:38
they don't sleep either but it is
06:40
wonderful to think
06:41
that your body doesn't have to be
06:43
restored all the time like we do on this
06:44
earth your flesh
06:45
needs rest and sometimes some people
06:48
need more than others
06:49
i sleep four hours a day sometimes three
06:52
i go about 20 hours a day
06:55
then i'm going inactive and my family's
06:58
adapted to that but some people need
07:01
eight they
07:02
need 10 hours i'm so glad that i'm up
07:04
for 20 hours so let's go to the next
07:06
question jen
07:07
okay this is there's no name on this one
07:11
at all
07:12
but um they wanted to know what is
07:15
a cherub what is a tear-up
07:18
oh that's the first time i've been asked
07:20
that well it's part of the angel tribes
07:23
in heaven
07:24
and a chair of people normally on earth
07:26
if you said the word cherub
07:28
and this is an anonymous question so
07:31
hello anonymous whoever you are
07:33
[Laughter]
07:38
you ask you did a rare thing you asked
07:40
the question no one's ever asked me
07:41
before
07:43
it talks about the cherubim now it
07:45
literally says the cherubim in heaven
07:47
people say
07:48
many different ways uh actually the
07:50
cherubim are very different creatures in
07:52
heaven
07:53
they are part of the angelic tribe a
07:56
chair of
07:57
most people shows a little fat baby
07:59
angel i have never seen any in heaven
08:01
i'm not saying they aren't there
08:03
i've just never seen a little fat baby
08:05
angel naked
08:06
no not that either and uh but a cherubim
08:11
is fantastic they have eyes and all
08:13
their wings
08:15
they're very uh powerful beings and
08:17
intelligent beings in heaven
08:20
and like the living creatures it talks
08:22
about in revelation
08:23
4. why don't you all go read revelation
08:25
4.
08:26
guess what you get a lot of revelation
08:28
about heaven itself that's when john
08:30
was caught up into the heavens and he
08:34
was in heaven itself and saw many things
08:36
he actually saw the cherubim
08:38
in heaven around the throne that had
08:41
many eyes and their bodies and their
08:43
wings
08:44
but a cheer up like people i'm sure and
08:46
all the valentine cars people
08:48
i've probably been buying there's
08:49
probably little baby cherubs holding a
08:51
heart or something like that
08:53
but but normally that's probably just
08:56
in heaven if you said cherub that would
08:59
be
09:00
short for cherubim that would be an
09:03
abbreviation for true of them
09:05
who are anything but little fat baby
09:06
angels
09:08
so there you go that's all i'm going to
09:09
give you today about the cherub
09:12
they're part of the angelic tribe there
09:14
you go
09:16
and i'm waiting on the next question
09:18
next question
09:20
okay this one's like a long list but i'm
09:24
not going to read all of them
09:25
i think we need a drum roll for this
09:26
yeah
09:28
this is one person's one person
09:31
now we love it when you send and ask us
09:33
a question but it's
09:34
kind of hard when you ask 50 or if
09:38
you send five paragraphs to ask your
09:41
question
09:42
um it's just go to the heart of it and
09:45
let's hear what okay
09:46
so this is from paulette in new york hi
09:49
paula from new york and she she sent
09:52
seven questions but i'm only gonna do
09:54
i'm only gonna do one pick one right now
09:57
and maybe the other ones will show up on
09:59
a
09:59
podcast or something okay okay um
10:05
i had it picked out where is it
10:10
okay here we go
10:14
where did the other races of
10:18
people come from which that's a bible
10:21
story
10:22
so i guess she's wanting to know
10:24
paulette wants to know where did all the
10:26
other races of the people come from
10:28
i assume she definitely means on earth
10:31
right so you need to make sure you say
10:32
earth or heaven where did the other race
10:35
because there's races of people who died
10:37
and moved to heaven too so
10:38
for me i need a little bit a little bit
10:40
detail so where did the other races come
10:43
from
10:43
on the earth well at one point there
10:46
weren't
10:47
races they didn't they weren't even
10:48
divided into races
10:50
they just had people on the earth and
10:52
everyone spoke the same language and
10:54
everyone spoke the same language which
10:56
was kind of wild if you can imagine so
10:58
everyone who'd been
11:00
born on the earth at one point there was
11:03
a point
11:04
on the earth when everyone spoke the
11:05
same language but we don't do that now
11:07
and the bible does talk about the tower
11:10
of babel
11:11
which did happen it was something that
11:13
it happened where god
11:14
uh decided to separate
11:18
the races and give them different
11:20
languages
11:21
and you can imagine when that did happen
11:24
that some people
11:25
after they could understand everybody
11:26
for so long and back then people lived a
11:29
very long time
11:30
and you know i know there were some
11:32
people who lived actually to be 700
11:33
years old
11:34
i think enoch was only 300 that was like
11:37
young
11:38
back then so back in this time when for
11:41
for years and years and generations had
11:43
gone by everybody understood everybody
11:45
and yet in the moment of a day there
11:48
came a time when
11:49
a lot of people didn't understand
11:50
everyone else and only certain groups of
11:52
people
11:53
i'm sure he chose whole families and
11:56
relations to those families
11:58
gave them a different language and that
12:01
caused those people to separate
12:03
create their own groups of people and
12:05
maybe even move where they could all be
12:07
together so they could understand each
12:09
other
12:10
all the people on the earth according to
12:12
the bible
12:14
adam was the very first one and it talks
12:17
about adam being the first
12:18
man on the earth adam and then of course
12:21
he created eve
12:22
they were the first ones he put them in
12:24
the garden of eden a lot of people know
12:26
that part
12:27
and then of course they had sons and
12:29
then the population began to build
12:31
but there came a point and it was at the
12:34
time of
12:35
noah that this happened this certain
12:37
thing happened
12:38
that that was when he got wiped out the
12:40
earth because the people were so wicked
12:42
so evil can you imagine
12:44
that there are probably hundreds of
12:45
thousands of people on the earth that
12:47
they were so
12:48
evil and wicked that he only
12:51
kept noah and his immediate family
12:54
and they were kept on the ark and the
12:57
bible says
12:59
from the time of noah onward
13:02
everyone on the earth came from the
13:05
lineage of
13:05
noah so i can say what i know
13:08
as far as what the scriptures say that
13:11
from the time of noah
13:13
everyone on this earth is related to him
13:17
because of course everybody else was
13:18
taken off the earth and people newly
13:20
born on the earth
13:22
all came from the lineage of noah so i
13:24
can just say that
13:25
and there was a time when the groups of
13:27
people were separated by god given
13:29
different languages
13:30
so we'll just go with that for right now
13:33
uh there is some things i may as well
13:36
just add this to cause discussions
13:37
between
13:38
between all of you there what there are
13:41
some
13:42
theories that people believe after adam
13:46
and eve
13:46
god kept creating people now i don't
13:50
know
13:50
and if you find it in the word maybe you
13:52
could inform
13:54
us in the comments i can't find it in
13:56
the world where it says
13:57
every single human being came from adam
14:00
and eve
14:02
because the the race was all destroyed
14:05
but at one point
14:06
when noah was saved the word does say
14:09
that from the time of noah everyone else
14:12
on the earth was related
14:14
from the lineage of noah so there is
14:17
this possibility that people talk about
14:19
all the time
14:20
that god could have made adam and eve he
14:22
could have made other people on the
14:24
earth because he was really trying to
14:25
accelerate
14:26
populating the earth and there's always
14:28
questions like well
14:30
who did adam and eve's sons mary who did
14:32
they married was it their sisters
14:34
was it someone else where did other
14:35
people come from i think we will all
14:38
probably
14:38
wait until we get to heaven to get that
14:41
question
14:42
answered so there you go next question
14:44
okay this is actually from
14:46
facebook um this is specifically
14:49
for you and um they must be
14:52
maybe new people that haven't heard
14:54
stuff from them okay yeah there's always
14:56
new people you need to consider that i'm
14:57
going to add this for free
14:59

15:02

every day throughout the day there are
15:23
new people discovering
15:25
me so they don't know a lot of the
15:27
revelation those of you who have been
15:29
watching and listening for 10 years you
15:31
know a lot but you still have to
15:33
consider here's some new person
15:35
who's watching maybe just found me by
15:37
accident like oh my gosh
15:39
look at that person she's got pink hair
15:41
but she's talking about god
15:43
okay so what is the question well it's
15:45
from jonathan
15:47
and patricia and it says do you leave
15:51
your body
15:52
when you visit heaven oh that is a very
15:55
good question
15:56
jonathan and patricia jonathan and
15:59
patricia
16:00
welcome to our q a session and that is a
16:03
wonderful
16:04
that's a wonderful question they want to
16:06
know that when i
16:08
am caught up to heaven do i leave my
16:10
body
16:11
because some people think where does
16:12
your body go does your spirit man go
16:15
and that'll give me an opportunity to
16:17
answer a couple other things to make it
16:19
clear
16:20
i don't go in my body my physical body
16:23
stays here
16:24
on the earth my family all know that
16:26
because if they come in my room or if
16:28
i'm sitting in my desk or something else
16:30
if they come up and speak to me and
16:32
there's no response
16:35
at all i'm just like staring saying
16:37
nothing
16:38
they know that my spirit man is in
16:40
heaven so i am caught up
16:42
by my spirit and i am taken to heaven i
16:45
don't make myself go
16:47
okay god's never done that with me he's
16:50
always just caught me up
16:51
either by the spirit of god sometimes
16:53
jesus comes and just catches me
16:55
by my spirit when i'm in heaven i don't
16:57
look down and see my body i don't look
16:59
down
17:00
i am focused on what they want to show
17:02
me in heaven and yes this has been going
17:04
on for a
17:05
long time for a very long time
17:09
since early 90s i've been caught up i
17:12
had got off to heaven
17:13
taken on tours of heaven for the purpose
17:16
of revealing to the earth what heaven is
17:18
like how heaven operates what the people
17:20
look like what their mansions look like
17:23
places that are made in heaven things
17:25
you get to do there
17:26
what about your family members all kinds
17:28
of things god has me reveal and i
17:30
actually have a commission i he came to
17:34
jesus came to me
17:35
in person face to face and said the
17:38
father and i are going to start taking
17:40
you on tours of heaven and guess what i
17:42
didn't say no
17:43
so it is my spiritual body and this is
17:45
why it's wonderful
17:47
i know for sure jesse duplantis
17:50
go check him out jesse duplantis he
17:53
lives in
17:54
new orleans or right outside new orleans
17:56
louisiana
17:57
he literally was caught up in his
18:00
physical body
18:01
and taken to heaven if you if that
18:03
happens to you
18:05
you will know now i know that you know
18:08
paul didn't know but a lot of people at
18:11
that time probably hadn't been caught up
18:12
to heaven
18:13
if you're caught up in your physical
18:14
body your physical body is not
18:16
accustomed to the glory
18:18
the power and the life of god that is in
18:20
heaven and eventually
18:22
your physical body would get weak in
18:25
heaven
18:26
however your spiritual body that is is
18:29
all spirit it's made out of light heaven
18:32
itself
18:33
is made out of light it's a building
18:34
substance so everywhere you go in heaven
18:37
in your spiritual body
18:38
you can touch the ground you actually
18:40
sit in your mansion
18:41
i have guests in your mansion you travel
18:44
all over heaven
18:45
you know on light or sound you enjoy a
18:48
literal
18:49
life and that's the proper way to say it
18:51
so every time i go to heaven i
18:52
experience
18:53
everything that is there but it is my
18:55
spiritual body and when god is done
18:58
he sends he brings my my spiritual body
19:01
back
19:02
zip right inside my body and then i'm
19:04
aware of everything i have every memory
19:06
of being there
19:06
the smells the emotions the things i
19:10
saw it's all retained because
19:13
your spirit man has a mind
19:16
okay your soul which is in your spirit
19:19
man
19:19
is what you express emotions from it's
19:21
what you gather information with
19:23
so your spirit man and your soul i was
19:26
caught up to heaven i have both of those
19:28
my physical body just sits and does
19:30
nothing
19:31
so there you go here's the answer all
19:33
right
19:34
next question is from bonnie
19:37
and it says do people who accept christ
19:40
on their death bed have big elaborate
19:44
mansions do people on their deathbed
19:48
have big elaborate mansions in heaven
19:51
that's really um more than one question
19:54
but i'll go ahead and
19:55
answer that question the bible clearly
19:58
says that god will reward us for our
20:00
lives
20:01
lived on the earth you're not going to
20:03
escape being rewarded by god
20:06
now what some people think of as a
20:08
reward
20:09
may not be the the powerful
20:12
supernatural reward that we get in
20:14
heaven
20:15
and the thing that he loves the most is
20:18
if you used
20:19
the gift he put in you like whitney
20:22
houston
20:23
she used her gift she sang she used it
20:26
all the time
20:27
it blessed god she got she gave herself
20:31
back to christ the night before she died
20:35
and let me tell you what she had
20:37
fantastic reward in heaven i didn't see
20:39
her mansion
20:40
but i was actually caught up to heaven
20:42
and i saw her receiving rewards from the
20:44
father at the throne
20:46
this was right after she had passed and
20:49
you know what this is the other thing
20:51
whether you have a massive mansion
20:53
because you really
20:54
gave your entire life every hour of the
20:57
day
20:57
you helped people loved people you use
21:00
the gift he put in you
21:02
you ran your race holy on purpose
21:05
they're going to have fantastic mansions
21:07
because they gave
21:09
more of their self now you cannot work
21:12
for your salvation
21:13
i have to say that that salvation is
21:16
free
21:17
and there is no one in heaven that is
21:19
sad
21:20
disappointed or upset so no matter what
21:23
they
21:23
ended up with to live in they were
21:26
filled with joy
21:27
with celebration with excitement because
21:31
of what god had made for them
21:33
but god is a just god and those who
21:36
really
21:37
served him loved him and loved others
21:40
and was forgiving all the time and
21:43
didn't live with the fence in them
21:45
of course their mansion is going to be
21:47
fantastic i have
21:49
seen mansions in heaven that were the
21:52
size of
21:53
new york city i hope that stretches your
21:56
mind
21:57
on realizing how huge heaven is
22:00
it's fantastic it is amazing there are
22:03
sky mansions mansions under the crystal
22:05
sea
22:06
there's an amazon forest and amazing i
22:08
just say amazon to give you an idea
22:11
uh there's like massive trees that would
22:14
be the size of 12 massive trees here
22:16
they're like 500 feet high there's
22:18
wonderful beautiful things there
22:21
so there's there's like forest there's
22:23
the mountain of spices
22:24
there's passionate paradise that's about
22:26
the love of christ
22:28
and worshiping him so many places in
22:30
heaven with many different mansions
22:32
i've never seen a shack
22:36
or just a little cabin if someone had a
22:38
cabin it was on the property of their
22:41
amazing mansion and family members do
22:44
live right next door each other but when
22:47
you come home to heaven you don't come
22:49
as somebody's husband or wife
22:51
you come home to heaven as the father
22:53
son
22:54
or daughter and he makes sure everybody
22:56
gets a mansion
22:57
so absolutely i've seen such amazing
23:01
beautiful mansions
23:02
and they were the mansions of little
23:04
grandma intercessors that prayed in
23:06
their closet
23:08
and prayed in three or four moves of god
23:11
forgave anyone who came against them
23:13
just poured out their life
23:15
all day for god and even though no one
23:18
on the earth knew them
23:20
god was quite aware of what they were
23:23
doing for him and he rewarded them
23:25
powerfully
23:26
but everyone in heaven celebrates the
23:29
fact that they're
23:30
there so next question okay next
23:33
question
23:34
is okay and i'm only going to mention
23:38
this because
23:40
this is like a major topic with a lot of
23:42
things
23:43
and a lot of people have said if you
23:45
don't do this specific thing
23:47
you won't go to heaven oh this is a good
23:49
one yes
23:51
and if and i know what you're going to
23:53
say
23:54
so of course you do you're my sister
23:57
and i've known you since you were a baby
23:59
but i love sharing this too because it
24:01
debunks
24:02
so much stuff of why you get sent in we
24:05
are
24:05
myth busters today yes and it's
24:09
important to do that so people
24:10
know the truth it says the truth will
24:12
make you free
24:14
and we are definitely filled with truth
24:16
and revelation from the father so
24:18
we're going to do it right now this is
24:20
from anna
24:22
and she would like to know do you
24:25
have to be water baptized in order to
24:29
well she didn't say in order to go to
24:31
heaven but oh
24:32
okay but it's necessary to be water
24:35
baptized
24:36
okay but you can expound on that foreign
24:40
if you don't get baptized you won't go
24:42
to heaven if you don't tithe you better
24:45
you know if you don't go to church yes
24:47
there's many things
24:49
um over time that has been developed in
24:52
the mind of
24:53
man and man and if you do not
24:57
many times have revelation from god
25:01
or the scriptures aren't open to you or
25:04
let's just say you never read the bible
25:06
you need to read the bible the true word
25:09
of god okay and people go what
25:12
translations do you read i'm just this
25:14
is a free
25:15
tip from catker i love
25:18
the amplified bible i read that's on my
25:21
desk i have the king james version
25:24
because it has a lot of stuff that is
25:26
truth in revelation that's not even put
25:28
in other translations
25:30
i i love the amplified i love the
25:32
everyday bible that's an older bible
25:35
i absolutely love my main reading
25:39
bible is the scofield bible because of
25:41
all of the comments
25:43
the commentaries that are put in there
25:45
the revelation that god gave that mr
25:47
scofield
25:49
that that really explain and expound
25:52
with revelation on the word of god so i
25:55
would definitely say
25:56
the niv the king james the amplified
26:00
the everyday bible i'm trying to think
26:03
of some other
26:04
versions of it some my my husband likes
26:07
to read
26:08
the one that's more like everyday
26:11
language it might be well it's not the
26:14
enemy if he was here would ask him but
26:16
i'll find out let people know later
26:18
because they're always asking me which
26:19
ones are okay
26:20
there are newer translations however
26:25
that leave out some of the word of god
26:28
some aren't even a complete
26:29
bible i'm not talking about just the new
26:31
testament it's great if you start with
26:33
the new testament
26:34
i also love the not just the historical
26:37
part of the
26:38
the old testament but the miraculous
26:40
that happened
26:41
hey people the parting of the red sea
26:44
all of that is real when elijah was on
26:46
mount carmel okay
26:48
those powerful things that happened way
26:51
back
26:52
in those days are exciting to read when
26:54
you see even god's hand move back then
26:56
the new testament of course is about
26:58
jesus christ what he did for us
27:00
the acts of the apostles did you know
27:02
that's what the book of acts was about
27:04
is what they did operating in the word
27:06
of god the power of god that jesus
27:08
christ gave them
27:09
when he raised up these apostles under
27:11
him but there are some newer
27:13
translations there's
27:14
every kind of bible out there trust me
27:16
even ones that are not good
27:19
okay that you don't want to read and by
27:21
the way this is for free also free tip
27:24
do not read false religions
27:28
words like their bibles like
27:31
it's not wise to fill yourself with the
27:33
quran
27:34
it's not wise to read the book of mormon
27:37
it is not
27:38
wise at all to read the satanic bible
27:40
none of these things are about false
27:42
religions that do not believe in jesus
27:45
christ his blood that he is the son of
27:47
god
27:48
or they leave out main events that are
27:50
going to happen
27:52
there will be a tribulation i've seen
27:54
the timeline of god that's embedded in
27:56
the floor
27:57
behind his throne and these things are
28:00
going to happen
28:00
the millennial reign of christ which you
28:02
could also say the thousand-year
28:04
reign of jesus christ on this earth it
28:07
will happen by the way that's
28:08
quite a ways away from here i've been
28:11
taking over 100 years into the future
28:13
we're still here so that's also a free
28:16
tip
28:16
you're not going to be you're not going
28:17
to be raptured out of here in the next
28:19
few days or the next few years
28:21
it's not going to happen in 10 20 30 40
28:24
50 60 i just could gone
28:26
it's going to happen when the father
28:27
decides what will happen but if you get
28:29
a bible
28:30
and it does not include major
28:33
acts of god or events that god has
28:35
already
28:36
ordained will happen he needs these
28:39
events to happen
28:40
for his purposes
28:44
don't read a bible that leaves major
28:47
things
28:48
out especially accountability especially
28:51
where it talks about sin make sure that
28:53
you repent of your sins
28:55
there's all kinds of stuff going on and
28:57
it's all kind of teachings
28:58
literally in some churches they teach
29:01
that you don't need jesus christ to go
29:02
to heaven
29:03
or that everyone's going to heaven no
29:05
matter what they've done
29:06
or the whole world's going to heaven i
29:08
promise you the whole world's not going
29:10
to heaven
29:11
but you give yourself to jesus christ
29:13
you find a word of god
29:15
that is supposed to be like a plum line
29:17
of decisions that you make
29:19
sometimes it will help you learn how to
29:21
pray how to develop an intimate
29:23
relationship with jesus christ so i'm
29:25
glad this question was asked
29:27
so there are many different translations
29:29
of what people
29:30
call the bible and if they're not a
29:32
whole word of god the whole new
29:34
testament or the whole
29:36
of you know the old testament or just
29:38
both of them together that's not a truth
29:41
that's not all the truth
29:43
you find a word and you find the church
29:44
that teaches the whole truth
29:47
you can't leave the holy spirit out of
29:48
your life he's the third member of the
29:50
trinity he is god
29:51
also so i can tell you right now
29:54
the bibles i read have the whole council
29:57
of god in them
29:59
and i've talked so long i forgot what
30:02
the original question was
30:06
is it necessary to be water baptized
30:09
and i didn't even answer that question
30:11
and he just went out but that's okay
30:14
i would have wheeled you back in when
30:15
you were so worried
30:19
you know why the word of god by the way
30:24
it talks about being water baptized yes
30:26
it's in the bible
30:28
you give yourself to jesus christ repent
30:30
of your sins
30:31
okay because you're not going to heaven
30:33
if you don't repent and i'll tell you
30:35
why
30:36
the father told me he's not letting evil
30:38
wickedness and sin
30:39
into heaven that's his home he said if i
30:42
let everyone come to heaven without
30:44
receiving my son
30:46
heaven would be just like the earth
30:50
and you don't want to live in eternity
30:53
in the earth right you're going to live
30:55
in heaven
30:56
and i need to i need a break just a
30:58
minute
31:02
okay
31:05
it is necessary to be water baptized
31:07
because that
31:09
is an outward representation
31:12
that you gave yourself to jesus christ
31:14
and when you do that it's like you
31:17
died with him that's what it is when you
31:19
get when he
31:20
he he wipes away all of your sin and
31:23
fills you with him
31:25
okay water baptism is an outward
31:28
expression that you received
31:29
christ and your sins were wiped away so
31:33
it's like you died and were resurrected
31:36
with him
31:36
in him and now he lives in you and
31:39
that's what water baptism is that's why
31:41
it is important to have it done however
31:44
it's not going to keep you from going to
31:46
heaven okay
31:47
if you don't receive holy spirit of
31:49
course that is such a power
31:50
living in you he will become your best
31:53
friend he
31:54
is my best friend holy spirit is and and
31:57
he tweaks me all the time he makes me
31:59
laugh he shows me things to come he
32:01
opens up the word of god
32:03
how do you get him the same way you get
32:04
christ you receive christ first and then
32:06
you invite holy spirit to indwell
32:08
you and let me tell you he's not going
32:11
to say no
32:12
so these are all a necessary process
32:15
because when you get saved it's
32:17
wonderful the salvation is free
32:20
you have grace for eternal life your
32:22
name is written in the lamb's book of
32:24
life
32:24
but it's important to do these other
32:26
things because they increase your
32:28
intimacy with christ
32:29
they open up the knowledge and the
32:31
understanding of god himself
32:33
so water baptism is showing and let me
32:35
tell you
32:36
you don't have to do it in church a lot
32:39
of churches have a baptismal they'll be
32:41
glad to do that for you
32:42
but i know people who've gotten baptized
32:45
in horse troughs and swimming pools
32:48
yeah one of my own dollars was baptized
32:49
in the swimming pool
32:52
at this private school that allowed
32:53
everyone to come they had ceremonies and
32:55
they did that
32:56
they just baptized you in water and let
32:59
me tell you
33:00
the most important thing it says if you
33:01
believe on jesus christ you shall be
33:04
saved
33:04
but being water baptized being filled
33:06
with the holy spirit
33:08
finding a good truth speaking
33:11
church because it says to not forsake
33:15
the gathering together of yourselves
33:17
that means you can be part of a prayer
33:19
group that means that someone who has a
33:21
home church you can attend that
33:23
some people watch church online and they
33:26
give and tithe into that place
33:28
wherever you are fed whatever
33:31
feeds you in the word of god if there's
33:33
somebody who does that whether it's a
33:35
church a prayer group
33:37
it could be a school of the spirit go
33:40
where you can get more of god so it's
33:42
not absolutely necessary
33:44
because i will go back to the same thing
33:47
that jesus said to the thief
33:49
on the cross yay the thief on the cross
33:51
the thief on the cross
33:53
recognized that jesus christ was the son
33:56
of god
33:57
and he received him by the words he
34:00
spoke to jesus himself
34:02
remember me when you come into your
34:05
kingdom remember me
34:07
because he knew who he was but the other
34:09
thief rejected him
34:11
guess where that thief went okay this
34:13
thief on the cross
34:14
received jesus christ and christ
34:17
answered him and said
34:19
today you shall be with me
34:22
in paradise now at that time
34:25
when people who were accounted just and
34:29
righteous because they
34:30
they recognized god and received him
34:34
then god kept them in a place in the
34:36
earth called paradise it was down here
34:38
it was a spiritual place a beautiful
34:40
place
34:40
so when abraham isaac jacob when all
34:43
those great
34:44
men women you know esther ruth when they
34:48
passed they descended into paradise or
34:51
abraham's bosom
34:52
and it was not hell it was not hell
34:56
that was for the wicked dead so i can
34:59
tell you
34:59
that because the thief on the cross he
35:02
went
35:03
and when and later on in that day this
35:05
is when they're hanging on the cross
35:06
this happened all right
35:08
uh when they when the thieves died
35:11
when they both died the one who rejected
35:14
christ
35:14
went into hell the other thief was
35:17
in paradise when abraham's bosom which
35:19
you know according to the word
35:21
when christ's spirit man left the cross
35:23
he descended into paradise
35:26
or abraham's bosom he preached the
35:28
gospel to
35:29
all of them because according to them
35:32
they their messiah had not come yet so
35:34
you're getting a lot of scripture right
35:35
now it's important to know this though
35:37
so abraham isaac david all those
35:39
righteous men
35:40
um that would also be joseph you know
35:42
the one who raised jesus
35:44
these people before christ died on the
35:47
cross
35:49
ascended after he wiped up hell
35:52
according to colossians he wiped up hell
35:55
on the third day he spoiled and ruined
35:57
prince valors and powers melted them
35:59
okay and he took the keys of hell death
36:01
and the grave from
36:02
lucifer and then at that point christ
36:05
rose up got his body back his physical
36:08
body
36:08
back so if you want to know is your
36:10
spirit man busy
36:12
can it see and hear and touch and feel
36:14
christ did all those things
36:15
in his spirit man descended into
36:18
abraham's bosom
36:19
saw the thief welcomed him greeted him
36:22
like he said he would
36:23
and then preach the gospel to all those
36:25
who were there
36:27
they were held captive in that place
36:29
because
36:30
heaven had to be chris had to pearl his
36:34
blood on the altar in heaven
36:36
and everyone sins from that point when
36:39
they repented
36:40
and you got forgiveness when you died
36:42
from that point you just
36:44
you ascended into heaven and abraham's
36:46
bosom was cleaned out
36:48
he led captivity captive and they all
36:50
went up to heaven
36:51
with christ so that changed everything
36:53
that's why it was necessary
36:55
so christ to do that so does that
36:57
because this is another
36:58
kind of you you answered someone's
37:00
question i was going to ask
37:02
okay but they just asked a further
37:03
question um
37:06
about paradise yeah so is it uh
37:10
is it temporary or is it no longer
37:12
existing
37:14
paradise was like i said it was another
37:16
word and it was called
37:17
both places in the bible called it said
37:19
abraham is
37:20
more paradise it was the place where the
37:23
those who were counted
37:24
just and righteous by god because they
37:27
believed
37:28
in him and this is before christ came to
37:31
the earth and died for us
37:32
it was a place that was created so they
37:35
had a place to stay and live
37:37
there was buildings there was a river
37:39
i've seen that place
37:40
a beautiful place that god kept his that
37:43
he counted as just and righteous
37:45
it was emptied out when christ went
37:48
there when his spiritual body left the
37:50
cross and he went into abraham's bosom
37:52
met actually he met in person abraham
37:55
isaac jacob king david
37:57
solomon adam was there the only ones not
38:01
there were elijah and nina
38:02
they actually were taken to heaven
38:04
itself by
38:05
by god the father he caught them up and
38:07
took them in their physical bodies
38:10
so they they were the only ones up in
38:12
heaven besides all of the angels the
38:14
living creatures
38:15
um god you know the father or son holy
38:18
spirit they all lived in heaven
38:19
but after that happened it says
38:23
in the word that people no longer
38:25
descended
38:27
they ascended christ descended for us
38:30
and he cleaned that place out by
38:32
preaching the gospel to them
38:33
not hell okay he didn't go there to
38:36
preach the gospel
38:37
and then after he preached the gospel
38:39
then he went over to hell
38:40
christ did and then he was there and it
38:43
says in the bible for three days he was
38:45
there
38:46
and then of course we know what happened
38:48
on the third day and then christ
38:49
after he was done wiping up hell taking
38:51
the keys he went back up to the tomb got
38:54
his
38:54
physical body it was glorified instantly
38:58
which is what we will experience on the
39:00
day that dead and christ will rise
39:02
our spirit men our spirit bodies have
39:04
been living in heaven that's us
39:06
will be rejoined with our physical body
39:08
it will be glorified that means you can
39:10
never sin
39:11
never fall never die never get sick that
39:14
you will be immortal it says mortality
39:16
will take on immortality
39:18
that's us we're mortals now we may be
39:21
supernatural morals
39:23
but to come a time in your life because
39:25
of your receiving of jesus christ that
39:27
you will be immortal
39:29
and that's scriptural so there you go
39:33
so it's empty abraham's bosom paradise
39:35
is empty now there's no one
39:36
yeah because when you die whoever owns
39:38
you oh comes and gets you comes together
39:41
and that's the best way the father said
39:43
to me the first time i've
39:44
got to heaven when you die whoever owns
39:46
you will come for you
39:48
so make sure you are praying for all of
39:50
your loved ones who don't know christ
39:53
because god gives us promises in the
39:55
word and it says because we are
39:57
believers who have received christ and
39:59
bleed christ
40:01
that there are things we can ask him if
40:02
we don't doubt in our heart but believe
40:05
what we say will come to pass
40:07
then we will have whatsoever we say and
40:09
the greatest thing you can do with that
40:10
scripture is stand
40:11
and say i stand for the salvation of my
40:14
family members for all those who don't
40:15
know christ i declare
40:17
they will know him love and receive him
40:19
and that we will be together
40:21
for eternity that is a powerful
40:23
declaration
40:24
but once you've prayed that for them
40:26
don't talk about how bad they are
40:28
okay you don't want to do that that's
40:30
like being double-minded if you're
40:31
declaring they're going to know christ
40:33
pray for them
40:33
love them you may not be able to
40:35
validate what they're doing don't
40:36
validate their sin
40:38
okay every time you see them love them
40:41
and just tell them god loves them
40:43
keep praying for them but it's a
40:44
powerful prayer for a believer to stand
40:46
for their family members because it says
40:48
you
40:48
and your household shall be saved
40:52
and so that's because you know christ
40:55
but uh so that answers that question
40:57
very good um let's take a
40:59
quick break oh yeah we want to uh tell
41:02
everybody what we're going to show them
41:03
yes we're going to take a little break
41:05
and let you know we have some new things
41:08
that we are going to we've been doing
41:10
actually
41:10
and one of them is called cat on the go
41:13
and you become a part of my life where
41:15
i'm going what i'm doing
41:16
and we stop and make a little mini video
41:18
and share that little piece of life so
41:20
we're going to take a moment and let you
41:22
see
41:22
one right now hi everybody this is pat
41:25
on the go and here i am
41:28
say hi welcome hey everybody yeah we're
41:31
very busy so we won't be talking to you
41:33
very long but
41:34
we're here discussing illustrations of
41:37
the things that will become images
41:39
in the resurrection movie is that right
41:42
right it's exciting isn't it to be a
41:44
part of it but
41:46
it is a lot of work trust me it takes
41:48
hours to do this
41:50
you know we have to make sketches and he
41:52
takes it makes it look amazingly
41:53
beautiful
41:54
okay i don't do that part he does and
41:56
then we come back and there's edits and
41:58
then he has to change things and i
42:00
change things and he changes things
42:02
but it's going to be amazing when it's
42:03
all done and we can't
42:06
we cannot we cannot wait to you know
42:09
take that throne
42:10
that throne that satan's been sitting on
42:12
hollywood he's going down
42:14
people going down god is taking it
42:17
and we are doing this back again i hope
42:20
you enjoyed that
42:21
and so we did these cat on the gos
42:23
different at different times on
42:24
different days but
42:25
you will enjoy every one of them so what
42:28
is the next question
42:29
um well this one's a bit of a
42:33
tough subject and i the question
42:37
flew by really fast so i didn't catch
42:38
who asked it but
42:40
um someone uh i think it was their
42:43
nephew
42:44
or something has recently committed
42:46
suicide
42:47
and they feel they're in heaven and
42:50
um i didn't get to like i said i didn't
42:52
get to read all of the question but
42:54
what is god's say about that
42:57
yes what does god say about when someone
42:59
commits suicide
43:01
so that is a very interesting question
43:04
for me
43:04
exciting but now you go that's just
43:06
weird this is exciting
43:08
not when god has caught you up on
43:11
purpose to give you revelation yes
43:13
and i have revelation on suicide
43:17
i never knew my whole life now there
43:19
were really strong christians
43:21
i knew growing up and then later in life
43:23
and they were going through a horrific
43:25
struggles
43:26
and they they ended their life
43:30
and i inside knew that they were in
43:33
heaven some of them i saw later in
43:34
heaven
43:35
and so the father on purpose said i'm
43:38
going to show you the truth
43:40
about suicide and he said first before i
43:43
catch you up you're going to go to
43:44
webster's dictionary and look up
43:46
what it says about suicide and i was
43:49
quite surprised because we all know
43:52
people who do that what
43:54
they call suicide what is called suicide
43:56
people are either
43:57
under horrific stress
44:01
or trauma and it can be physical
44:03
emotional or
44:04
mental there's three areas in life where
44:08
the
44:08
enemy will just bombard you and crush
44:10
you
44:11
until you no longer can stand it and
44:13
then people
44:14
in their life take their life and
44:16
everyone tags it
44:18
suicide but god doesn't do that
44:21
god is just and righteous so when i
44:23
looked up the word suicide in the
44:25
webster's dictionary it said
44:28
someone who commits suicide is in their
44:31
right mind
44:32
with all of their senses they are
44:39
knowledge of their mind their will and
44:41
their emotions they know exactly what
44:43
they're doing
44:44
they're not in trauma or stress and they
44:47
take their life
44:51
and god said to me that would be like a
44:54
terrorist
44:54
or a suicide bomber there are people who
44:57
plan
44:58
on purpose in their right mind to on
45:01
purpose
45:02
die and most of the time our last time
45:04
that is to hurt other people
45:06
yeah like let's say um 9 11.
45:10
okay all those people who are involved
45:12
with the
45:13
the death of all those people when those
45:16
planes
45:17
hit the buildings they knew their life
45:20
would be taken that was suicide these
45:23
people
45:23
willingly knowingly got on those planes
45:26
to on purpose go kill
45:28
people and end many people's lives and
45:30
that is called suicide
45:32
what people this is the father speaking
45:34
to me what people are experiencing
45:36
they're not ending their life they
45:40
can't bear the pain they're in whether
45:42
it's mental
45:43
emotional or physical sometimes people
45:45
are in accidents
45:46
the pain has agony the medicines
45:49
sometimes the medicines
45:51
even will give you thoughts of suicide
45:54
and some people just
45:55
can't no longer handle the suffering and
45:58
god said they don't want to take their
46:00
life or end their life
46:01
they're ending their suffering and he
46:04
said to me
46:05
i would be unjust especially if this
46:08
person had received my son
46:10
and they couldn't handle the suffering
46:12
they were ending the suffering he said
46:14
i do not send those people to hell and i
46:16
do not call that suicide
46:19
and so therefore that is a very
46:21
important answer
46:23
and the first time i released that
46:25
people were in shock
46:26
but it makes sense because if somebody
46:28
knew christ
46:30
but then some tragedy happened to them
46:32
whether physical mental or emotional
46:35
that wasn't even their fault and they
46:37
couldn't bear the suffering so they all
46:39
they want to do is go home to heaven
46:40
this does not give you excuse because
46:42
you're going through a hard time
46:44
to to take your life to go to heaven
46:46
that's not right
46:47
but people who are in agony
46:50
on strong medications going through
46:53
trauma's therapy
46:54
you know when they get to the point
46:56
where they cannot handle
46:58
living they end their suffering and
47:01
after he taught me that he took me to
47:03
heaven and showed me three different
47:05
people
47:06
and i think it's even in one of my books
47:08
where he talks about
47:10
this whole thing about ending your
47:12
suffering
47:13
or taking your life there's a difference
47:15
so you know
47:16
a terrorist suicide person someone like
47:19
that
47:19
that is suicide but someone who's ending
47:22
their suffering
47:23
because of the trauma even some children
47:25
do it teenagers
47:26
older people people every age suffer but
47:29
this
47:30
is the good news if
47:33
at any time when they were still in the
47:35
right mind if you can get them to choose
47:37
to
47:38
lose i was just going to say i will tell
47:40
you god
47:41
was so adamant about this that he told
47:44
me
47:44
i'm going to put despair on you for a
47:47
week
47:48
and you will not be able to bear it and
47:50
people go why would he do that so i
47:52
would totally understand
47:54
what people are feeling when they get to
47:56
that point
47:57
and he said right before suicide there
48:00
is despair
48:01
despair when you get into despair
48:03
there's no hope no way out it's
48:06
absolute agony in your mind to even
48:08
exist
48:09
and he said i'm going to put i'll let
48:10
you experience it and he he
48:12
literally put despair on me and for a
48:14
week i would go climb in my car this was
48:17
years and years ago he did this and i
48:19
would all i would do is cry out to him
48:22
i couldn't bear it i let me tell you i
48:24
couldn't think right
48:26
my emotions were a mess physically i had
48:30
no energy i couldn't even think of a way
48:32
out
48:33
but i knew in my mind this was something
48:35
god was letting me experience i think
48:37
it's the only way
48:38
i actually survived it at the end of the
48:41
seven days he just came and took it off
48:44
and joy and celebration flooded myself
48:47
he said i don't want you to ever forget
48:50
that is what people experience when they
48:52
go through oppression
48:54
depression deep depression then there is
48:57
a spirit of depression on people
48:59
and then there's despair after despair
49:02
gets in then that's when the suicidal
49:05
thoughts start coming
49:07
people need to not keep that in them
49:10
that's why he tells me
49:12
god says don't even let sadness be in
49:14
you do not let sadness
49:16
rule your life most of the time you
49:18
don't even know why you're sad you need
49:19
to say i
49:20
choose as an act of my will to lose all
49:22
sadness
49:23
all oppression all depression
49:26
[Music]
49:27
all despair and for some people you need
49:30
to say this i lose
49:31
every suicidal thought from me i will
49:33
not keep it in my soul
49:36
and then you say and i choose with my
49:38
will to bind the life of god
49:41
the love of god the presence of god
49:45
his joy his celebration
49:48
those i bind to my soul and no one can
49:51
take them from you i hope
49:53
this really helps somebody today but it
49:56
does give
49:56
hope for all those if your family member
49:59
was in agony in the end of their
50:01
suffering
50:03
i promise you and especially if you made
50:05
a stand for them to know christ
50:07
they will be in heaven this is the hope
50:10
we have and a promise we have
50:12
from jesus christ and people tell me
50:16
sometimes you don't talk about jesus he
50:18
is my everything
50:20
he is my number one my husband
50:24
is my number two and that's not ever
50:27
going to be changed
50:29
don't run out in the spirit and become
50:32
so supernatural to signs and wonders and
50:35
forget
50:36
who gave you the right to do that
50:40
we can't go through this life and be
50:43
successful and happy if you do not make
50:45
jesus christ your number one
50:47
before you start looking for someone
50:49
else to fill a void in your life
50:51
make sure jesus is there first
50:54
so i think we're probably going to have
50:56
to end this i might take
50:57
one more question quick one one more
50:59
question and then we have to go on to
51:01
something else
51:02
this is from i hope i'm saying this
51:03
right it's um karina
51:06
and she would like to know if you have
51:08
any insight on tattoos
51:11
this is another good one i love these
51:13
ones i have revelation on
51:15
because you know um
51:18
earthwise time i've been around for a
51:20
while may not look like
51:22
it and i think like a child because the
51:25
more i know god the more i
51:26
act like one and think like one
51:30
but for years i was told
51:33
that tattoos were a sin a crime against
51:36
god
51:36
a blaspheme in leviticus it talks about
51:40
them
51:40
it says you shall not mark yourself and
51:42
so people
51:43
let me give you the revelation god gave
51:46
me
51:47
that scripture was talking about the
51:49
culture of
51:50
that day this is in the old testament in
51:52
leviticus in the old testament
51:54
it said you shall not mark yourself with
51:57
the
51:57
marks of the dead
52:01
now in some of the new translations they
52:03
may have changed that scripture or say
52:05
you will not have tattoos on you but
52:07
that's wrong
52:09
because that's not the great translation
52:12
god does mark people himself as
52:15
invisible was a tattoo it is a visible
52:18
permanent mark he marked
52:21
cain in the bible remember that
52:24
when he had even killed label but so
52:26
people would not kill cain
52:28
god put a mark on him letting people
52:30
know do not kill him
52:32
that was a permanent visible mark in the
52:34
bible
52:35
it says some people will mark
52:38
me mark me put my marks
52:41
on them and so there are people who have
52:46
a permanent visible mark on them we in
52:49
this time and age we call that tattooing
52:52
and let me tell you even in heaven when
52:54
you get there
52:56
it says god will put his mark in your
52:59
forehead
53:00
the name of the city of your god will be
53:02
put a permanent visible mark
53:03
in your forehead and it will be put in
53:06
the palm of your hand
53:07
this is in the word of god people so
53:10
heaven puts permanent marks on you
53:12
it also says in the bible that god will
53:15
mark
53:17
144 000 jews that will do powerful
53:20
things for him
53:21
in the last day so what are you going to
53:24
say to those people you can't go to
53:25
heaven because you have those marks on
53:27
you
53:28
there will be people that will put marks
53:30
on their self because god has even asked
53:32
them
53:33
they will not represent hell okay these
53:35
marks cannot represent hell
53:37
because what you put on you says
53:40
who you serve yeah and so that part is
53:43
very important as signs of
53:45
things that represent death or hell
53:47
should not be put on your body
53:49
and if you had that done a long time ago
53:51
i would encourage you to go back
53:52
and have them changed i do know that
53:54
it's possible
53:56
i do know this in this great move of god
53:58
coming
53:59
where the fire of god will be loosed
54:01
over people he will actually erase
54:03
a lot of the other kind of tattoos off
54:06
of you
54:08
but you cannot put that as something you
54:09
can't just put in a box
54:11
because that scripture in leviticus says
54:13
in the culture of that day
54:15
they were marking themselves with
54:17
satanic marks all kinds of people
54:19
back in the way back in the day in the
54:21
old testament
54:22
they were cutting themselves and cutting
54:25
off parts of their body and giving them
54:27
to idols
54:28
worshiping idols okay it also says you
54:30
should not cut yourself
54:32
uh you should not worship a false god
54:34
all this was the culture that was taken
54:35
place
54:36
back in the old testament in this in the
54:38
leviticus
54:39
in those days so but it does say you
54:41
should not mark yourself with the marks
54:43
of the dead
54:44
i will also add this if you're young and
54:47
you are still living
54:48
under the covering of your parents don't
54:52
run out and get one just because i said
54:53
that to you
54:54
when you are on your own if you want to
54:57
have
54:58
something that represents heaven
55:00
revelation that is going to be your own
55:02
decision when you're out on your own but
55:04
don't do something that's going to call
55:06
cause grief in your family or strife in
55:08
your family okay
55:09
make sure that that is going to be okay
55:12
with with god
55:13
and if you're under your parents you
55:16
honor your father and your mother and
55:17
let me tell you i always did that
55:20
and if god ever tells me to get one i'm
55:23
going to wear it
55:24
i keep saying i may get it i'll make it
55:26
if you got better on my
55:27
face it'd probably be would we
55:31
a wing of the living creature with eyes
55:32
in it or something but right now i'm not
55:34
planning that
55:35
but i need to give you truth and that is
55:37
true that marking yourself
55:39
in today's world they would call that a
55:40
tattoo it doesn't it's not
55:42
all jesus has wrong jesus himself
55:46
has on his entire thigh has
55:50
written a permanent visible mark that
55:52
says
55:53
he is the king of kings those are
55:55
spiritual kings
55:56
and the lord of lords so our own lord
56:00
and savior
56:01
has that mark on him and god has used it
56:05
in the past and present
56:06
okay to let people know they live for me
56:09
they represent me
56:10
so go you be powerful re please
56:14
run after jesus christ first
56:17
get revelation ask for revelation
56:20
yourself
56:21
and we're going to end our session right
56:22
now so that i can go and do something
56:24
our q a session and go into something
56:26
else
56:27
and i hope you have a blessed day and i
56:30
release the
56:31
life of god in part the life of god
56:34
the joy of the lord in jesus name and so
56:38
we're going to go on to our next session
56:39
yeah we're just going to switch we're
56:41
going to switch topics right now
56:44
and we're going to talk about the
56:45
guardian zone yay
56:47
we love our guardian and we love this
56:49
because this is a plan that god
56:52
gave us again the things that we do
56:55
no matter what those things are if god
56:57
creates an event through us
56:59
or a move of god he's starting he has us
57:02
make a mark or a logo
57:03
for it because he's marking it as his it
57:06
will cause a move of god with whatever
57:08
that purpose is
57:10
and we love it when he does that and for
57:12
years
57:13
because my book was actually written in
57:16
2005 2006 my first book
57:19
and he gave me a deadline to have it
57:21
published by may of 2007
57:23
and it was i actually met that deadline
57:26
and it wasn't easy because i still lived
57:28
with all of with my family my
57:31
my mom my mom my sisters
57:34
a couple of my sisters lived with us my
57:36
niece
57:37
my daughters my husband and i we all
57:40
have one big home together
57:42
and i had to write that book in the
57:43
midst of that so all you people that god
57:45
have asked you to write you don't have
57:46
an excuse
57:47
you find time you do it he wants that he
57:50
needs that message given to people
57:52
whether it's just to make people laugh
57:54
to give them a
57:56
revelation on how to do any ideas and
57:58
inventions let's say it's
58:00
uh it's powerful revelation on the word
58:03
itself
58:04
uh maybe a prophetic book about things
58:06
to come you have to step out and start
58:09
that book
58:09
and i had to write it we're living with
58:12
all of that stuff going on
58:14
in my own home it was never quiet i
58:17
never had any really quiet time
58:19
and it's a good thing i do stay up and
58:21
my my greatest
58:22
creative time is from midnight to 4 a.m
58:24
is when i in those
58:25
hours that's when i wrote all my books
58:27
just when i do all my sketches most all
58:29
of them are done during that time
58:31
and so sometimes you just have to find a
58:33
way to do it
58:34
by the way at our our events we have
58:37
different events
58:38
and heavens invitation this is going to
58:40
be for free right now heaven's
58:41
invitation is coming up in june
58:44
and we will have a pr a free
58:48
author how to become a published author
58:51
or self-published author workshop
58:54
and when you can get something for free
58:57
that is a good thing
58:58
and there are different methods that you
59:00
can use to write and you stick to that
59:02
protocol
59:03
but let me tell you only 10 of all books
59:06
that are started
59:07
ever get published and it is possible to
59:10
get published so i want to encourage you
59:11
in that moment
59:12
but i'm going to talk about the guardian
59:14
zone and the holy spirit and the father
59:16
dropped this in my spirit
59:18
and we actually designed a logo several
59:20
years ago
59:22
which represented the guardian zone and
59:26
and that image that you're going to see
59:28
or you are seeing right now
59:30
it represents two flows something is
59:33
flowing in
59:35
so it can flow out so as the support
59:39
and supply comes in that's your giving
59:44
then the revelation can go out
59:47
and what people do when they join the
59:49
guardian zone
59:50
you're a member but we call you a
59:52
guardian how about that god
59:54
does love to give titles i know man
59:57
talks about not having titles but god is
59:59
really big on giving titles to people
60:01
especially in these powerful days we're
60:03
in now
60:04
so you will become a guardian by your
60:06
continual support in giving your
60:08
financial giving
60:09
and we actually have people right now on
60:12
phones that you can call this very
60:14
moment and they will answer the phone
60:17
they take down your information and
60:20
how you would like to give it it doesn't
60:22
matter if it's weekly
60:23
monthly you know it can be
60:26
annually whatever but most people choose
60:29
to give monthly or
60:30
or weekly whatever god puts in your
60:32
heart to give
60:33
whatever is in there to give it it helps
60:36
us to
60:37
release more revelation like the studio
60:40
it costs money okay it costs money and
60:43
you'd be surprised probably if you've
60:44
never done it
60:45
what it costs to do things like this
60:47
because we have really good cameras now
60:49
we have professional lights we have an
60:51
awesome media desk let me tell you what
60:55
my one sister
60:57
my one sister hello patty
61:00
uh paid for this media desk knowing what
61:03
would be used for
61:04
she will get reward because of
61:07
purchasing this for so we could have a
61:09
professional looking
61:11
desk to do all of our media and our
61:14
broadcast
61:14
we're going to be doing webinars really
61:17
they are going to be coming up
61:19
we're going to do webinars we're going
61:20
to do all kinds of things
61:22
from here we will actually have weather
61:24
warriors weather broadcast
61:26
we have a green screen that's uh we're
61:28
setting all that up so we can do stuff
61:30
with the green screen
61:31
and there'll be a point where we do
61:33
weather warriors
61:34
and you literally will see on the green
61:37
screen
61:38
the weather the destructive weather or
61:41
the threat of it you'll see it
61:42
on the green screen and as we're
61:45
declaring and decreeing over you may see
61:47
things
61:48
changed immediately or we will come back
61:52
the next day and show you the actual
61:55
thing that happened let's just say a big
61:58
tropical storm is coming and it was
61:59
building and growing it was
62:01
really getting bad and we all take
62:03
authority over that
62:05
in our with our weather warriors group
62:07
from all over the world now we have
62:09
people in every country now that do this
62:12
um and it's gonna be powerful and by the
62:14
way i might as well just tell you
62:15
we are planning a webinar for weather
62:18
warrior training instead of making
62:20
everybody come here to do that
62:22
we're already working on setting all
62:24
that up
62:25
sometime in the spring i can't give you
62:27
a date at this moment but we will have a
62:29
webinar it will cost a small fee
62:32
because we will need people to be here
62:34
that aren't normally here we'll have all
62:35
kinds of other stuff that we'll have to
62:37
have
62:38
and things going on it will not be very
62:40
much but let me tell you
62:42
it's cheaper than flying getting a hotel
62:46
and having to sit and wait in between
62:48
the events it will be
62:50
powerful focused training on how to be a
62:54
weather warrior
62:55
and you will be so filled with it and
62:57
trained with it no matter what comes up
62:59
anywhere and if you see or hear
63:01
something coming up in the world that is
63:03
destructive
63:04
you should take authority over it
63:06
because you're over the weather not
63:08
under it so there's my
63:09
free clip that's just one of the things
63:11
that some of our
63:12
funds are used for and some of these
63:15
funds that people are
63:16
you're giving right now that's what the
63:17
guardian zone is
63:19
is helping to support heaven's plan
63:24
to release heaven on earth and
63:27
create products that represent heaven on
63:29
earth
63:30
and put them in the marketplace and you
63:33
have to supply
63:34
for me because i don't get a big check
63:37
from a church somewhere you know i love
63:40
church by the way i'm going to give a
63:41
plug to church god is not abandoning the
63:44
church he's going to
63:45
settle set it free the ones who are
63:48
teaching deception like it's okay to
63:50
send all you want to you
63:51
that's called deception uh pray for
63:54
those people
63:55
but don't stay there okay the church
63:58
is the way god designed so that we could
64:01
all have
64:02
members to be together to fellowship
64:04
together
64:05
to break bread together and to help each
64:08
other
64:09
it's very important we have many
64:11
revivals in the past it wouldn't have
64:12
been possible if people
64:13
in churches involved in church were not
64:17
there
64:18
and so i do know there's a lot of home
64:19
churches as many new ways god is doing
64:22
things we're in a new time
64:24
in the spirit realm and in god's plan so
64:27
i'm all for home churches churches and
64:29
offices
64:30
these are people who teach the word they
64:32
they pray for people they have prayer
64:34
groups intercessory groups schools of
64:36
the spirit now schools of the
64:37
supernatural
64:38
it's just exploding everywhere so
64:40
there's many ways to get to know god
64:42
get more of god but these funds that you
64:46
give us
64:47
help to provide provide for me
64:49
personally
64:50
and to help take revelation places we
64:53
never could do it before
64:55
and it helps us to put new materials out
64:57
there for people
64:59
so i really appreciate every person and
65:02
many people have responded
65:04
to become a guardian and i'm just going
65:06
to share a little bit
65:08
the numbers are on the screen right now
65:10
to call and like i said we actually have
65:12
staff
65:12
right now waiting to take down your
65:15
information if you'd
65:16
like to become a member of the guardian
65:18
zone
65:19
and you don't want to go online yourself
65:21
to do it
65:22
you can actually call and they can take
65:25
all your information
65:26
and they will sign you up in the
65:28
guardian zone and then what you're going
65:30
to get
65:30
is i send revelation reports to you
65:34
at different times throughout the year i
65:36
have special gifts that are being
65:38
designed
65:38
as tokens of our appreciation that you
65:41
will receive
65:42
and every year you will get towards the
65:44
end of the year you'll get a real
65:45
beautiful collectible item
65:47
from my heart to yours and you will have
65:50
god's blessings on you because this is
65:52
heaven's plan
65:54
and so uh people have all kinds of
65:56
questions sometimes about this
65:58
god is not against people giving
66:00
especially
66:01
if it's his plan and it helps those who
66:04
are pouring out their life
66:06
to do what god is asking and if people
66:09
around this world weren't willing to
66:11
give their life to christ not just
66:13
receive christ
66:14
but spend their life giving the truth
66:18
praying for people i know powerful men
66:21
and women of god that are out there
66:22
right now around the world
66:24
helping people and giving to them
66:27
if they're doing that is a god thing
66:30
people complain about paying tithes or
66:32
giving offerings or
66:34
you know the bible is free the bible
66:37
itself
66:38
isn't free actually unless you go to a
66:40
group
66:41
like maybe the salvation army the
66:43
gideons you probably can get a free
66:44
bible
66:45
but all these bibles are being the
66:47
wonderful ones filled with truth
66:49
have all kinds of helps in them and
66:51
things that people spent
66:53
a lot of their life doing translations
66:56
in different languages
66:57
for different purposes we probably
66:59
eventually i don't know when
67:01
we'll probably have a revelation bible
67:04
filled with revelation on the word of
67:06
god itself
67:07
and the times and all those things right
67:09
now he's got me on many different
67:11
platforms doing things but i can tell
67:14
you those who are doing it
67:16
and then they put that in the bookstore
67:18
to be sold you cannot walk in a bible
67:20
bookstore
67:21
and just take products out of there and
67:22
walk away and say i'm taking these free
67:25
it's like going to anyone who has their
67:27
business and this is how they make their
67:29
money
67:29
and i want you to know that even jesus
67:31
made money on this earth he had a
67:33
business he was a carpenter
67:34
he didn't give it away for free that was
67:37
his living
67:38
paul worked with fabrics and i know he
67:40
did make tents but he also made banners
67:42
and all kinds of beautiful things
67:44
he made a living even while he was
67:46
ministering and when christ was
67:48
ministering i'm sure there was a point
67:49
where he did stop doing that
67:52
but it's okay to be in business and
67:54
minister
67:55
also at the same time and so you go to
67:59
the store and you go to places all the
68:00
time to spend your money
68:02
you're getting what you paid for but
68:05
here when we do things like this
68:06
and every day we're putting stuff out
68:09
there
68:10
i i believe right now there's probably
68:12
500 hours
68:14
on youtube of me talking about heaven
68:17
on every kind of subject possible and
68:20
that we do not charge for that we don't
68:22
charge of course for facebook
68:24
uh all the stuff we put out there when i
68:26
go and speak
68:28
you know when i go places i'm invited to
68:30
speak sometimes
68:31
they have to charge a fee because they
68:33
have to run to place they have to pay
68:34
security they have to pay the ushers
68:36
they have to pay people to come and be a
68:38
part of that
68:40
and so i can hear the phones ringing
68:41
right now that makes me very happy
68:43
but even ourselves in our own events
68:47
that we hold every single year we will
68:50
not ever charge people to attend those
68:53
events
68:54
that means that we are taking on all the
68:57
expense and i'm just going to give you a
68:59
tip
68:59
because some people never know if
69:02
somebody goes and they're going to hold
69:04
a big event like in a hotel
69:06
unless it's a three-day event and it's a
69:08
major hotel
69:09
they could be paying 20 000 to
69:13
rent the space in that hotel because
69:15
this is the hotel's property
69:17
you also bring most of the time your own
69:20
equipment
69:21
like your speakers your microphone your
69:23
technical
69:24
technical stuff you have to carry and
69:26
take it into these places
69:28
people are really blessed if they find a
69:30
church that might let them rent the
69:31
church
69:32
to have a meeting and so that's probably
69:35
a little bit
69:35
less expensive but i know we ourselves
69:38
in the past
69:39
we would pay like twelve hundred dollars
69:40
a day to be at the marriott those
69:43
meetings we held there they weren't free
69:44
for us but we didn't charge anyone
69:46
that's something god ask of me
69:49
personally
69:50
so our main events which would be
69:52
heaven's invitation
69:54
that's heaven inviting you to get
69:55
revelation that's always in june
69:58
okay then we have the dread champions
70:00
that is the manifested
70:01
sons of god that is for men and older
70:05
teens
70:06
teenagers boys uh that is just for them
70:09
and they have powerful events with the
70:12
men and then we have the wonder women
70:14
that is our all women event
70:18
and i can tell you what we shake hell
70:22
we shake hell we send the armies of
70:25
heaven
70:25
all over the world we had people women
70:27
from 40 almost 40 different places
70:31
i'm talking about countries that come to
70:33
these events
70:34
it's always going to be usually the
70:36
first weekend in november
70:38
and so uh we are already putting stuff
70:41
out there to save the save the date
70:44
for these meetings that are coming up
70:46
we're already making major plans for
70:48
them
70:48
and of course weather warriors will also
70:50
be an annual event
70:52
and uh like i said we're we are right
70:55
now creating a webinar
70:56
where we can do that and people from all
70:59
over the world will be able to join on
71:01
that webinar
71:02
we will get the dates to you as soon as
71:04
we have it all set up
71:06
like i said there'll be a small fee you
71:08
you'll pay that to join us you'll be
71:10
given a special link to go to
71:12
so that you can watch it and only the
71:14
people who up who will
71:16
sign up for that event for that webinar
71:19
they will be able to see it
71:21
and be trained powerfully it will be
71:23
over the course of two days that we will
71:25
have
71:26
that this is something new for us but we
71:28
will begin if i mentor
71:30
my mentoring in the future will only be
71:32
done the webinar so it's going to be
71:33
very powerful that we have this source
71:35
of media to use
71:37
so i'm just giving you some tips on what
71:39
do we do with that money
71:40
okay i am not just by myself i'm not
71:43
sitting here alone by myself
71:45
i have staff all around me i have staff
71:47
in the other rooms of our office right
71:49
now
71:50
one day we will have a huge place
71:52
because god has already shown me that
71:54
and i do know what will happen
71:56
and eventually we will have staff and
71:59
facilities around this world but this is
72:03
where we are starting okay
72:05
uh my my family you know we still
72:08
live here because right now this is
72:10
where god has us so it's like we're in
72:12
our office 24 hours a day that's what it
72:14
feels like sometimes
72:16
and so it powerfully helps us you know
72:19
god blesses us and the word talks about
72:22
giving offerings and sharing i don't
72:24
usually go into that part of it it's
72:26
what is in your heart
72:27
if you receive revelation if it has
72:29
changed your
72:31
life we will eventually one day actually
72:33
have a program
72:35
that does nothing but share testimonies
72:37
from around this world
72:39
of how revelation has changed their life
72:42
it's the more of god
72:43
it comes from his self it's from his
72:45
throne
72:46
and we love sharing that a lot of my
72:49
staff
72:51
learn to adapt to heaven culture that's
72:53
what we call it
72:54
and we explain in many of my messages
72:57
out there you learn how to live heaven
72:59
culture you learn how to take authority
73:01
you learn how to work with the army of
73:03
heaven
73:04
you are trained because it is our job
73:08
the bible says that the fifo ministry is
73:11
here
73:11
to train you we're not supposed to just
73:15
share a few good words
73:17
and sing a couple nice songs you need to
73:20
lead
73:21
changed okay we go from glory
73:24
to glory by getting more of god
73:27
and then applying it if you receive
73:31
if you go to church you get a powerful
73:32
message and they give things to inspire
73:35
you
73:35
and to help you that means you apply it
73:37
to your life
73:39
and so i tell people i'm not here just
73:41
to talk to you i'm here to help
73:42
change you and trust me
73:45
until you are walking in the spirit okay
73:49
that means your flesh has died to itself
73:52
when you walk in the spirit it blesses
73:54
the heart of god but your life begins to
73:56
be
73:57
it's like you breathe him in and you
74:00
breathe him out
74:02
walking in the spirit brings life
74:05
okay it even says that in the word of
74:07
god walking in the spirit is not
74:09
partnering with hell
74:10
not tolerating hell in your life all
74:13
that stuff is true in the bible
74:14
there is a hell i have been there and
74:16
seen it there certainly is a literal
74:18
heaven i've been there and seen it many
74:20
times
74:21
and god has powerful things for us right
74:23
now in this slide
74:24
so make sure you call the number on
74:28
there
74:28
and you join the guardian zone i will so
74:31
appreciate it
74:32
you can go online we do have a website
74:35
you can go to
74:36
if you're if you're if you're technology
74:38
based you certainly can go to
74:41
catker.com and you click on the treasury
74:45
and then you choose the guardian zone
74:48
this is the way you yourself you can go
74:50
on there and fill out all the
74:51
information
74:52
choose when you want to give how much
74:54
you want to give and then that will be
74:56
done
74:56
for you so there is an online way to do
74:59
it and believe it or not people who do
75:01
nothing but live in technology
75:03
don't understand there are actually many
75:06
many people
75:06
still in this world that don't even own
75:08
a computer that wouldn't know how to
75:10
operate a computer
75:11
some of them actually don't have cell
75:13
phones is that wild
75:15
so not everyone is buddies carrying
75:17
around their tablet or their ipad
75:20
totally connected to the world that way
75:22
there's still old school
75:24
people around and there probably always
75:27
will be
75:27
i know technology is changing everything
75:30
and we have to move with all of that
75:32
but but this is a way that you can give
75:35
the guardian zone is helping to support
75:38
heaven's plan
75:39
and i appreciate it so much that you
75:42

you could choose with your will you can
01:33
think about things
01:34
choose it and then you do it and then
01:37
your emotions
01:38
display who and what you believe
01:42
with your life is probably one of the
01:45
least talked about things in the church
01:48
is a soul growing up i always heard that
01:51
it was bad
01:53
went but god made it right he it's one
01:56
third of us is that right
01:59
we'll always have our soul how why would
02:01
he make it bad
02:03
it's a powerful thing and it's a good
02:06
thing
02:06
because you can feel yourself with god
02:08
and then you'll be like him
02:10
you can talk about him then you really
02:12
believe he is real
02:15
you can feed your soul 24 hours a day
02:19
your body gets fed a few times a day
02:22
your spirit man gets fed once a week
02:26
most people go to church once a week
02:30
but your soul is fed all the time by
02:33
what you watch
02:35
what you say what people say to you you
02:38
can be crushed by tragedies and
02:40
you can't you can't forget it you hang
02:41
on to it somebody can wound and hurt you
02:43
and it stays there forever
02:45
your soul has layers and it collects
02:48
things in those layers
02:51
that's why you have a memory but your
02:54
layers
02:54
are supposed to be used for different
02:56
something different than that
02:58
every layer of you looks like you who
03:00
wants revelation on the soul let me see
03:02
your hand
03:05
i was shown one and the father spent
03:09
four hours with me earth time i never
03:11
usually know but i looked at my clock
03:13
and i was talking to him then he just
03:15
catches me up and begins to show me
03:17
a human soul what it looked like how he
03:19
made it why did he make it that way
03:21
how people can cause their soul to
03:22
prosper all the time
03:24
and then they'll live in divine health
03:28
there was a requirement about that
03:30
prospering
03:32
it says even as your soul prospers
03:35
you will prosper and you will be in
03:39
health that word be means live
03:42
it's called divine health so i
03:47
since i learned about this the father
03:48
taught me about that he said people can
03:50
lose
03:51
with the keys of the kingdom you can
03:52
loose things out of your soul
03:55
when you lose it it's gone
03:58
and that doesn't matter what it is he
03:59
started giving me this very long list of
04:02
things that you can lose from your soul
04:05
and he said i know most people bind the
04:06
devil with the keys to the kingdom
04:09
but they mostly never talk about the
04:11
loosing thing what are you going to do
04:12
with the leucine key
04:15
and yet the binding key is more
04:17
important to bind the things of god to
04:19
your soul because then they can't be
04:21
taken away
04:23
what you choose to bind to your soul
04:26
about god
04:27
will never be taken from you
04:31
and so people i know you know you still
04:33
want to bind the devil go ahead and do
04:35
it
04:37
i'd rather loose the stuff out of my
04:38
soul that he tried putting there
04:42
you know if you have an anger issue
04:43
anger anger angry all the time you don't
04:45
even know you're just
04:46
angry it's all comes out of you it's in
04:48
your soul
04:49
you choose with your will to lose that
04:51
that anger
04:54
then heaven comes down and they pull it
04:55
out say what's loose on earth
05:00
is loose in heaven you know how amazing
05:04
you would be if you didn't have all that
05:05
junk in there
05:08
especially wounds and wounds can keep
05:10
you from the things of god
05:13
as much as sin can
05:16
don't leave a wound in you because then
05:18
the enemy will come and try to use it
05:21
amen so tomorrow night not tonight
05:26
we're going to do a soul checkup i hope
05:29
you're coming who's coming tomorrow
05:30
night hope everybody's coming i hope
05:34
you don't want to miss tomorrow night
05:35
this is just the introduction
05:38
we're going to do some spiritual warfare
05:40
with the host
05:43
they'll be excited you may leave with an
05:46
army if you don't have one
05:50
they were made for us amen they won't
05:52
let you worship them
05:54
they don't have time for that and
05:57
neither do you
05:58
amen tomorrow night we're going to have
06:01
some fire
06:02
sent the angels already outside waiting
06:05

00:05
good morning everybody
00:07
[Music]
00:08
this is almost my morning
00:10
[Laughter]
00:13
how many people don't know me or know
00:15
anything about me anybody got dragged
00:17
here
00:18
[Laughter]
00:22
i'm so glad you're here i prayed for you
00:24
a long time ago
00:28
that people would understand heaven is
00:30
different
00:31
they live differently there uh hair
00:33
color is heaven culture
00:36
i didn't ask for this i am not a paint
00:39
care person well i am now
00:42
but years ago when the lord came to me
00:44
in person
00:46
because even as a child i would say if
00:47
jesus ever comes to me in person and
00:49
asks me to do something there's no way
00:50
i'm not saying yes
00:52
this is like an eight-year-old okay so i
00:54
was strange even back then
00:56
i've been a seer my whole life i was
00:58
born with that gift that does not belong
01:00
to the enemy
01:01
most people when you mentor mention the
01:03
seer or the spirit realm
01:05
they think you're part of the new age
01:06
movement
01:08
no it was around long before the new age
01:11
movement was here
01:12
okay it belongs to god it's sent from
01:15
heaven
01:15
he needs seers on this earth and he
01:18
needs prophets that are seers
01:21
more than anything else because we say
01:24
what we see whatever he takes us and
01:28
shows us
01:29
the difference between a prophet and the
01:31
seed of prophet is we actually get to
01:33
see what he's saying
01:35
not just hear him say it therefore we
01:38
give details
01:40
and i can assure you what i say to you
01:42
today will be things he told me
01:45
or showed me or both
01:48
and maybe things you never heard of
01:49
before or even thought of before
01:51
but i speak on behalf of heaven on this
01:54
earth
01:54
that is my commission it's not my gift
01:58
my gift my passion is photography
02:02
so you see before you a photographer
02:05
minding her own business
02:08
which is now god's business remember
02:12
when jesus said i must be about the
02:14
father's business remember when he said
02:16
that
02:18
i understand what he meant when he said
02:20
that
02:21
okay because he had the life of a
02:24
carpenter correct
02:25
say amen he was sent is a carpenter
02:29
corrupt right he was then as a
02:31
businessman
02:33
and he knew who he was long before he
02:35
got to that place of being a businessman
02:38
god loves business people because they
02:40
have openings that
02:41
a lot of people who are in you know if
02:44
they're
02:44
christian leaders or in any way
02:46
associated with a christian
02:49
i don't like to say religious because
02:50
god's not religious
02:53
he wants a relationship with you
02:56
and even that is sometimes new to people
02:58
that never heard that
03:00
man man created religion christ created
03:03
a relationship
03:05
he died for every single person
03:08
right on the planet he didn't die just
03:10
for a denomination
03:12
and saying that i was part of the
03:13
assemblies of god almost
03:15
all of my entire life and grew up in
03:18
that atmosphere which was
03:19
awesome we had holy spirit we had the
03:22
gifts working we had miracles
03:24
we sent missionaries all over the world
03:26
i helped to serve at our family church
03:29
not my dad's church but it was our
03:31
family's church i'm from a family of 15
03:34
children i'm number three that means i
03:37
died a long time ago
03:41
i also can read your thoughts
03:45
just a tip i belong to jesus christ
03:49
since i was four years old that was well
03:50
over 60 years ago i forget
03:52
how old i am because i don't look at age
03:55
god counts time by events
03:59
and so he chose me for a certain time on
04:01
this earth
04:02
to do things and say things for him i
04:05
never
04:05
asked to be caught up to heaven he
04:07
decided that
04:09
i was going to be a photographer i was
04:11
going to work in business i loved
04:13
working with ceos for over 25 years i
04:16
was working in business
04:18
he took me out of that at one point in
04:19
my life and he said i'm gonna prepare
04:21
you for what is coming
04:22
and the next season of your life he
04:24
didn't say it would be to be caught up
04:26
to having non-stop
04:28
to give revelation on what heaven is
04:29
like
04:31
i would have done it anyway because by
04:34
that time i was besotted with him
04:37
i sought him earnestly on purpose
04:41
fiercely for over 20 years now remember
04:45
i was born again at
04:46
four this is when i'm into my 20s by
04:49
this point in my life
04:50
and in my 30s i really passionately and
04:54
i raised
04:55
three children i'm married there's my
04:57
husband of 43 years sitting right there
04:59
y'all pray for him okay
05:01
he has to live with me i'm not normal
05:05
[Laughter]
05:08
you can't be normal when you've been to
05:10
heaven as many times as i have been
05:12
there
05:13
this is not really reality to me
05:16
standing here this is a vapor in time
05:20
your life right now is a vapor in time
05:23
your future is going to be so powerful
05:26
and great and grand
05:28
and i'm not just talking about when you
05:29
get to heaven i'm talking about because
05:31
of the time you live in right now
05:34
one of the most amazing fascinating
05:36
powerful times to be alive on the earth
05:38
is actually right now
05:40
and anytime god before he did something
05:43
great the enemy showed up to try to
05:45
steal
05:46
that time the enemy wants his time
05:49
his time is not yet and the father would
05:52
tell me all the time
05:53
he's only given satan a bump in the road
05:57
that's what he calls the tribulation in
05:58
the paris times
06:00
and there's people now even saying
06:01
they're not going to have that they're
06:03
wrong
06:05
i've seen god's timeline part of it and
06:08
he is going to
06:10
have those things happen for his own
06:12
purposes he needs them to happen in the
06:14
earth
06:15
they'll be for a short time but the
06:17
times we're entering into now will be
06:19
for generations maybe you didn't think
06:21
that again
06:22
i've seen 50 to 100 years into the
06:25
future
06:26
and the mere perilous times had not
06:28
happened
06:29
the tribulation had not happened and i
06:31
think it would be
06:32
better if we stop saying he's going to
06:34
come tomorrow
06:36
i will say he's going to come when the
06:37
father tells him to is the correct thing
06:39
to say
06:40
christ is coming back i absolutely
06:42
believe in the rapture
06:44
i absolutely believe that those times
06:45
will happen but those aren't these times
06:48
we haven't even done the works alone the
06:50
greater works
06:53
christ passionately said certain things
06:56
would happen and some of them
06:57
haven't even happened he's not willing
07:00
to wrap it up
07:02
and end it in the midst of darkness
07:06
amen things are getting greater and
07:09
greater
07:10
and more and more powerful in these days
07:12
we literally will learn to rule like
07:14
christ did in the earth
07:16
the bible clearly says don't tell me
07:19
what the word says i know what it says
07:21
people better know what it says
07:23
it says we will rule and reign with
07:24
christ now
07:26
say now and in the time to come
07:32
we will that's who we are we have
07:34
authority as believers if you're not a
07:35
member of the body of christ you have no
07:37
authority
07:40
you have no authority over satan you
07:42
have no authority in the spirit realm
07:44
you have no authority to speak for god
07:47
if you're not belong to jesus christ and
07:48
you have not had your sins washed away
07:51
you are not righteous i hope you say
07:53
amen
07:55
god does not agree with it's okay to sin
07:57
all the time whenever you feel like it
08:00
that's right god does not agree with
08:02
once you get saved
08:04
and if you if you sin and keep on
08:06
sinning the grace will cover it
08:08
that's only if you repent
08:12
that's what the word says is that
08:14
correct
08:18
christ is righteous and just if you
08:20
repent of your sins he will cleanse you
08:22
from all unrighteousness is that what
08:23
that says
08:24
that means when you sin say you're not
08:26
saved when you sin
08:29
something happens in your soul when i
08:31
have you say it that's why i do that
08:33
when you sin that makes you unrighteous
08:38
when you repent he wipes it away
08:42
and you are righteous
08:46
i just as blunt as i can be
08:50
i i love the truth i live by the truth
08:53
i have to myself
08:56
it doesn't matter that he catches me up
08:58
to heaven all the time shows me
08:59
mysteries takes me into the past takes
09:01
me into the future
09:02
i know what his heart is i know what his
09:04
words are i know what his ways are i
09:06
walk in them
09:07
i know his will is not always what ours
09:09
is
09:11
the best way you can live is his will
09:13
his way
09:15
not his will your way
09:18
he he desires so much for us to attain
09:20
to everything
09:22
that christ won for us
09:25
this is one of those times where we're
09:26
going to rise above
09:28
our lives and all the way we've been
09:30
living in the past that doesn't mean he
09:32
won't desire
09:33
holiness in our life that means we'll be
09:35
doing things we never dreamed we would
09:37
be doing
09:38
and therefore when he's going to do
09:40
something like that he has to clean
09:42
the platform off
09:45
a platform of man that platform of the
09:49
enemy and crush the enemy and push him
09:51
back
09:53
so that we will have freedom to move
09:55
around this earth
09:56
not just in this country which by the
09:58
way will be absolutely not just restored
10:01
but almost reborn
10:06
this is not the time for america to go
10:08
down the tube and end
10:11
we are this is what the father says you
10:13
are a baby country
10:15
you're still a baby you have begun to
10:18
walk in all that i desire
10:20
and i created you to do in this earth
10:24
you are it will be a great light to this
10:26
world
10:27
a place where people can come to know my
10:29
son
10:30
a place where they can walk in the glory
10:32
that is created by those who love
10:34
me a place where people come to see
10:38
the miraculous as a normal way of life
10:42
amen a place will come to america not to
10:45
find the american dream
10:47
but define me
10:51
a place where prosperity will happen
10:55
because two-thirds of the gospel has
10:57
been paid for
10:59
by people from this country
11:02
i am not going to ignore the cries or
11:05
the prayers of my people
11:07
they are precious to me they allow me to
11:09
give me permission to move and operate
11:11
on their behalf
11:13
and even over those who would take steal
11:15
and try to steal
11:16
cheat and steal and take this country
11:18
away
11:21
if you're interested the father calls
11:23
biden a villain
11:27
you should say amen
11:32
a villain in any movie is the worst
11:34
people
11:35
who promotes and carries out evil deeds
11:39
and the father is well aware of
11:41
everything that's going on behind the
11:42
barbed wire
11:45
and he's not going to tolerate it
11:50
because of the importance of these days
11:53
for god
11:54
for his son for holy spirit in this
11:56
earth and especially particularly a
11:58
miracle because it helps
12:00
others know and learn about jesus christ
12:03
and let me tell you that is not going to
12:05
stop happening
12:07
they have carried the message of the
12:08
gospel of the kingdom
12:10
they will now begin to carry the
12:12
knowledge
12:13
and the power of the glory
12:18
he is not going to give up his time for
12:20
the glory
12:22
to be seen and known in this world
12:24
there's actually
12:25
scriptures written about the glory of
12:26
god
12:28
the number one is christ in you
12:32
is the hope of glory
12:36
do you know what that means
12:39
that means you will begin to create
12:41
glory for god and you will carry that
12:43
glory
12:44
amen literally the light of god will
12:46
come from you
12:50
that scripture also means that you will
12:52
release that glory and operate in that
12:54
glory
12:55
how do you think the knowledge of it is
12:56
going to go around this world
12:59
we will demonstrate it
13:03
things beyond your imagination are the
13:05
days we're stepping into
13:08
because of that god won't even send new
13:10
creations
13:12
and inventions to this earth because
13:13
he's not willing for the wicked you have
13:15
them
13:17
say amen he's well aware of everything
13:21
that's going on
13:22
he's not oblivious to it it's not that
13:25
he doesn't care
13:26
he does care he just has a plan
13:29
amen and it may not line up with man's
13:31
dates that they keep trying to give that
13:33
he's going to do something
13:35
they were all wrong or he would have
13:37
done it
13:39
he won't even give me a date he'll say
13:40
i'm going to do this
13:42
and i'll say god's going to do this it
13:44
doesn't bother me that it doesn't happen
13:46
for a year or several months or even
13:48
weeks i've waited 45 years before for
13:51
him to do something he promised me
13:53
and i never gave up and he did it
13:56
amen my family understands faith we
14:00
lived by faith
14:03
god was welcome in our home so his holy
14:05
spirit so was jesus christ
14:06
he was our healer you got 15 kids you
14:10
need jesus as your healer
14:13
from being shot point blank with a
14:15
shotgun
14:16
to being bit by deadly spiders
14:20
from being hunted by people kidnapped
14:22
and then brought back
14:25
we stood in faithful albums and every
14:28
one of them
14:29
we had victory why can i not stand
14:33
for a few months to see god act in my
14:36
country
14:38
and in my nation this is not just about
14:40
america
14:41
this is about the whole world right now
14:45
he is exposing evil all over the world
14:49
in great detail and most people will be
14:53
shocked and i promise you
14:54
you will know what was going on
14:57
you actually see the evidence hear the
15:00
hear hear the testimonies see the videos
15:04
of the horrific things that have been
15:06
already got they already have the
15:08
evidence right now this moment i'm
15:09
standing here they have the evidence
15:12
and i will promise you this trump is our
15:14
president
15:18
if you don't want that you need to lose
15:19
something out of your soul
15:22
because you're fighting against god not
15:25
trump
15:27
god picked somebody who couldn't be
15:29
bought who couldn't be forced
15:31
who couldn't have fear put in them who
15:32
could not be controlled
15:34
he picked him on purpose and he picked a
15:36
businessman
15:39
he has already proven himself that he
15:41
loves this country and he loves the
15:43
people in this country
15:44
and there's actually you should know by
15:46
now persecution comes because the enemy
15:49
doesn't like certain things
15:52
the persecution is the proof that you're
15:54
going to get what you ask for
15:58
you have properties and lands
16:01
and blessings in this life with
16:04
what say persecution
16:08
you should always rejoice when
16:09
persecution comes
16:11
that means you're doing exactly what god
16:12
wants
16:13
[Applause]
16:14
it's really evidence i rejoice i compass
16:18
and say man you should be rejoicing and
16:20
dancing
16:21
you've got all that persecution you're
16:22
going to get something great from god
16:25
and he never saw it that way i said
16:28
that's how jesus seems
16:31
he wasn't concerned at all about
16:32
persecution
16:34
he didn't care that the religious
16:35
hierarchy didn't like him he was a
16:37
threat to them
16:40
he was also a character when he walked
16:42
in this earth he was funny
16:44
people loved to be with him even sinners
16:48
i'm sure he captivated them in
16:50
revelation they never expected to hear
16:52
they heard words they never heard before
16:54
and it made them burn inside
16:58
people burn in heaven because of the
17:01
revelation they live in
17:04
in the parts of god they see you never
17:06
got to see
17:07
they get to see parts of the future they
17:09
get to see parts of the new earth
17:11
they saw how things were done by god way
17:14
in the past
17:15
before even the physical realm was
17:17
created
17:19
your family members are living in the
17:21
greatest place possible
17:23
they are happy they're rejoicing they're
17:25
blessed beyond measure
17:27
they have mansions no human hands can
17:29
afford to build
17:32
your mama and your dad your grandparents
17:35
great grandparents
17:36
don't want to come back not because they
17:39
don't love you but they're one of the
17:40
one who loves them the most
17:44
you can have the understanding of that
17:46
love
17:47
it makes it a lot easier to live in this
17:49
world
17:50
when you see it through christ's eyes
17:52
when he was on that cross
17:54
dying for all of us
17:58
and he understood that people didn't
18:00
understand they didn't have a clue
18:03
the ones who were even reviling against
18:05
him at that point
18:06
he died anyway didn't he
18:11
what little is it to us to die to our
18:13
flesh sometimes
18:15
if we have a choice to be kind to
18:16
someone even if they're being mean to us
18:19
it's one of the greatest things you can
18:21
do to pierce the enemy
18:25
you pierce the heart of the enemy when
18:28
you
18:28
love instead of fighting back against
18:30
people
18:32
when you're kind even when you're spent
18:34
is fought upon
18:35
or mistreated or wrongfully accused
18:38
when you choose to love doesn't mean
18:40
you're just being foolish
18:42
it means you're piercing the enemy
18:48
your worship also pierces the enemy
18:51
it goes right through the second heaven
18:53
maybe you didn't know about that
18:55
satan has built his own little tiny tiny
18:57
kingdom up there
18:58
he sits on a throne of skulls and
19:02
he rules from up there because he's a
19:04
prince in power in the air
19:07
so he can do things in the spirit realm
19:09
the spirit realm is both
19:11
both sides are there all the time this
19:14
is not heaven
19:15
all right you're not living in heaven
19:17
right now we're having more
19:19
heaven sent down than ever before that
19:21
heaven
19:22
is not deserved and neither is hell
19:27
heaven is beyond your imagination with
19:29
the glory with the beauty the splendor
19:31
the creativity the wonder of being there
19:35
in his presence all the time with him
19:38
you ride on your worship
19:39
across the skies of heaven into the
19:41
throne room
19:43
you're transported through beams of
19:45
light from one side of heaven to the
19:46
other
19:48
the food is everywhere there's no weight
19:49
gain or food allergies on heaven
19:52
everyone is young there is no age there
19:55
is no time
19:57
there's amazing fun exciting things to
20:00
do
20:01
because the father is a father it says
20:06
you must be like a little child because
20:08
when you get there you're going to be
20:09
shocked to see how many fun things he
20:10
made for you
20:11
[Music]
20:12
you may be 90 now but you feel like
20:14
you're 9 when you get there
20:19
there's laughter everywhere in heaven
20:23
people love it it is love because he's
20:26
there
20:28
and he chose this time not
20:31
us many people are in fear
20:34
they shouldn't be if they belong to him
20:36
he actually said i have not given you a
20:37
spirit of fear
20:38
but of power say power
20:42
i want you to notice that's the number
20:43
one thing he says has given us he gives
20:45
us
20:46
power that power he gives us as a
20:49
believer is over
20:50
all the power of the enemy
20:53
that means no matter what's going on
20:54
around us we have authority to speak
20:56
against that
20:58
you have authority to speak against
20:59
anything the enemy is doing to you
21:02
because jesus gave us that
21:05
every demon should run in fear when you
21:07
get up in the morning
21:10
hell should tremble when you open your
21:11
mouth and speak things to people
21:14
amen because you have authority in your
21:17
mouth
21:18
you have the word of god you have the
21:22
power of god
21:23
you have the life of god you get
21:26
revelation
21:27
you have you have his plans his will for
21:30
your life
21:31
he chose you and put you on the earth
21:33
that's why you're here right now
21:35
no matter who you were birthed out of
21:37
you were birthed from him first
21:40
and he went down his timeline and chose
21:42
when you would be here
21:44
because he needs you here
21:48
so these days are going to be different
21:50
than anything we've ever lived before
21:52
i've already seen these days i've seen
21:55
well into the next 50 years
21:59
that should be normal
22:02
so i have no fear of anything he holds
22:06
my life in his hand
22:07
and the father holds the breath of every
22:10
being on this earth
22:13
and there are some so wicked he said all
22:15
i have to do is remove it and they're
22:17
out
22:19
there are some very wicked people in
22:20
this world right now they may not live
22:23
through this
22:27
yes god has done that before in the past
22:28
he wiped everybody off the earth it was
22:30
so wicked
22:32
as bad as it is right now it is not as
22:35
bad as it was to the tase of noah
22:38
i know people think it is but it's not
22:41
it's i'm not i talk about those horrific
22:43
things that they did back then
22:46
but there are people wicked enough to
22:48
want that to happen
22:51
and the thing is when the enemy finds
22:52
enough and he's actually found a lot
22:55
of humans who are willing to do things
22:57
his way
22:58
but the enemy's already lost because
23:01
this is not his time
23:04
even when it is his time he's not going
23:06
to get what he wants
23:08
because even those who are believers at
23:10
the time of the tribulation
23:13
and the parasites will be some of the
23:15
strongest believers ever walked on this
23:16
earth
23:18
they won't even be afraid to die i know
23:21
i've seen the movies
23:23
from the time i was young i've seen the
23:24
movies about
23:27
you know during those days how bad it
23:29
will be uh nobody will be forced to take
23:31
the mark
23:32
the mark is not the michael chip you
23:34
can't see it
23:37
that mark satan's going to put on people
23:38
will be seen three blocks away
23:41
because he's full of himself and he
23:44
wants people to know who gave themselves
23:46
to him
23:47
so that won't be something that is
23:48
forced on anybody
23:51
he wants people to willingly do that and
23:53
right now he's found a lot of willing
23:55
people
23:56
but it's still not the time for him to
23:58
have authority in this earth
24:01
therefore god is going to take and wipe
24:04
the platform clean not just in america
24:07
but he will remove evil
24:09
from many different places and high
24:11
authority and leadership in many
24:12
different countries
24:13
around this world
24:16
i know everybody said well we're going
24:18
to have the harvest it still won't be
24:19
the final harvest
24:21
the first waves of harvest we get those
24:23
people need to be mentored
24:25
to walk in the supernatural and learn
24:28
how to roll with jesus christ
24:31
so we don't know how to do that how are
24:34
we going to mentor them
24:37
we can't be normal we cannot be normal
24:42
you can't live your life every day like
24:44
it's the same you live your life with
24:46
passion and excitement
24:48
that we've been given great authority
24:51
actually he gave us the earth amen
24:54
we are stewards of this earth we're
24:57
stewards of what goes on around here
25:00
and god said i will allow what you allow
25:03
i will not allow what you don't allow
25:06
that's also in the bible so why are we
25:09
allowing things
25:13
everything you say from your mouth is
25:15
written down
25:18
you should go back and read the scripts
25:21
i started counting my words a long time
25:23
ago
25:25
because i see scribe angels writing
25:27
things down
25:32
about ten years ago i woke up and there
25:34
were two things sitting on the end of my
25:36
bed
25:37
and then one scribe angel looked at me
25:39
said we have been sent for the words of
25:41
all the leaders in the body of christ
25:44
at this point now we will write down
25:45
everything they say
25:47
whether in public or in private
25:50
and from those words are speaking god
25:53
will decide who will have a leadership
25:55
in these great
25:56
end days and who will not
25:59
have leadership those who will operate
26:02
in power and authority
26:04
those who will not allow to operate in
26:06
power and authority
26:07
if there's sin in their lives they will
26:10
not be allowed to operate
26:12
not in these greater days of glory he
26:15
said people can
26:16
fake many things they can fake being in
26:18
the five-fold ministry
26:20
they can fake by things they say and yet
26:22
they're sinning behind the scenes
26:25
but god sees everything that's right
26:29
he's not watching you to hit you over
26:31
the head with something
26:32
he's watching you to see what is in your
26:34
heart
26:36
what do you desire to do for others
26:41
that thing to esteem others more highly
26:43
than yourself goes a long way in heaven
26:46
i was raised that way
26:50
my dad was raised that way i'm from
26:52
seven generations
26:53
of believers who actually believed
26:58
i was the one who didn't want to be
26:59
known or seen by anybody
27:01
i was not someone who would put pink in
27:03
my hair was the quiet one
27:07
watch out for the quiet ones they're
27:10
thinking
27:11
and they're watching all the time
27:15
i can just tell you god had a plan for
27:17
my life i had a little plan i was going
27:19
to get me a nice apartment
27:20
and be in some big company
27:23
because i loved working in business i'd
27:25
like to see things happen
27:27
and god had another plan no i'm going to
27:31
give you pink hair i'm going to take you
27:32
up to have a non-stop
27:34
and you're going to go all over the
27:35
world and speak to everybody you're
27:36
going to hug them and let them
27:37
kiss you on the cheek if they want to
27:41
i was not a person that wanted to be
27:42
hugged or kissed by anybody
27:46
and yet i mean been kissed thousands of
27:48
times by people
27:49
around the world you know greet each
27:52
other with a brotherly kiss
27:54
that kind of a kiss so he's changed me
27:58
he's changed the way i think the way i
28:00
look at people i look at him through his
28:02
eyes
28:04
he loves you more than you ever ever can
28:07
imagine
28:08
no matter who you are even what you've
28:10
done even with your failures with your
28:12
mistakes
28:14
things that you gave up on he has not
28:16
given up on you
28:18
and he has not given up on this country
28:21
amen he has repeatedly told me america
28:24
is not evil
28:27
it isn't america itself is not
28:30
it's one nation under god
28:34
and he says that to me all the time it's
28:36
my country
28:38
it's mine and he said in 2015 i put my
28:42
hand
28:42
on the country and i turned that map red
28:49
and he had already declared that trump
28:51
would be president for eight years
28:54
knowing every single thing that would
28:55
happen
28:57
and god says oh no he means right now
29:01
not talking about in 2024 he's talking
29:03
about right now
29:07
he said to me trump won the election
29:10
he didn't lose that makes him president
29:14
the other side lied and cheated
29:17
that disqualifies them he said if in the
29:20
olympics they are caught cheating
29:23
they are not congratulated they are not
29:26
honored they're not rewarded they are
29:29
removed and they have
29:33
absolute all the proof they need that
29:35
that happened just because the civil
29:37
courts wouldn't hear the cases doesn't
29:38
mean justice is not coming
29:42
and i can promise you trump knows all of
29:45
this
29:46
he's not been lazy he's been very busy
29:49
behind the scenes so are many other
29:51
smart
29:52
smart and intel smart people around the
29:55
world
29:56
that know what is right and what is not
29:58
right
30:00
and they don't need any more evidence
30:01
than they have to take all of them to
30:03
prison or
30:04
be shot for treason
30:08
these i'm speaking truth not making it
30:10
up
30:11
this is true trump is still our
30:14
president
30:14
he won the election uh on the election
30:17
date
30:18
and when they said we're going to stop
30:20
the counting
30:22
the holy spirit who is right beside me
30:24
said
30:25
that's really going to cheat and steal
30:27
and change all the votes
30:30
he said that to me right when they said
30:32
those words we're going to stop the
30:33
voting
30:33
we'll pick it up tomorrow and then we'll
30:35
see what happens well
30:37
by that time almost 80 million people
30:39
had already voted for trump
30:41
yes and if you'll notice you never saw
30:45
biden's people
30:47
he never had rallies because he had no
30:49
people
30:51
but they didn't know what they were
30:52
going to do they knew from the beginning
30:54
they would cheat they already had their
30:56
plans laid out that all those the voting
30:58
machines and the dominion system
31:01
already working on their behalf and i
31:03
know most of you weren't aware of that
31:05
but they switched so many votes
31:08
overnight that before trump can switch
31:09
them to biden
31:11
and finally there's one county that is
31:13
given permission
31:15
to recount have 2.1 million of the
31:18
ballots
31:19
looked at individually all over again to
31:21
make sure that they were counting
31:23
but that's still not how he's going to
31:25
be put back in office
31:27
there's already things that have
31:28
happened even in our military
31:30
i will tell you this that the ones who
31:32
are sitting there illegitimately god
31:34
says
31:35
are illegitimate in in dc he says the
31:37
ones behind barbed wire that's how he
31:39
talks about him
31:40
[Music]
31:43
are still hoping we will give up
31:46
and let them do what they want to and
31:49
this is what the father says
31:51
there was a couple things they never
31:53
considered when they plotted this whole
31:55
thing
31:56
together with the intel you know with
31:58
the wicked rich with the fake
32:00
news media i mean there's so many that
32:02
are going to be probably be
32:04
either put in prison lose what they have
32:05
built up lose their fortunes
32:08
because they will have been busted
32:12
you're going to lose they'll lose all
32:13
the way around there's no way they will
32:15
ever win
32:15
anything or have anything this is from
32:18
the father himself
32:19
he said number one they're trying to do
32:21
this in a country that already
32:23
is free they're not going to a third
32:27
world country
32:28
that isn't free they're trying to take
32:30
things away from americans
32:32
they're different they were born free
32:35
they live free they make up their own
32:38
mind
32:39
they want a future he said there'll
32:41
never be civil war that's what they were
32:42
hoping for
32:43
that we would be killing each other
32:46
he said but americans true americans the
32:49
red-blooded americans
32:51
have a hope for a dream and a future
32:54
they have a family they want a life and
32:57
they want to live
32:59
and they are not willing to give it up
33:02
they didn't vote for evil
33:04
they didn't choose evil he said an evil
33:06
is not in power right now
33:09
he will remind you of a scripture and
33:11
the righteous
33:12
are in power that people rejoice is that
33:15
what it says
33:17
well trump isn't power the other side is
33:20
not
33:21
they're illegitimate they stole the
33:24
election
33:25
he knows that almost 80 million people
33:28
know
33:28
that it was stolen because everybody
33:30
knows who they voted for
33:32
amen so this is an epic time in our
33:35
country
33:36
to show when truth prevails
33:40
and the people prevail this country
33:43
belongs to god
33:45
and we the people amen
33:48
the other thing they will never consider
33:52
[Applause]
34:00
and god says all the time i'm in your
34:02
papers
34:03
i'm on your money
34:07
i'm written in your in your constitution
34:09
you said i'm everywhere
34:10
because i was allowed to be in this
34:12
country
34:14
he said when you look at the two
34:15
differences between the illegitimate
34:17
ones
34:18
and the actual president i am welcome
34:22
in this country by trump
34:26
he even made that statement many times
34:28
he recognizes who god is
34:30
he invites god to be here he he loves
34:33
christians he loves their faith he loves
34:35
the
34:36
the churches he loves and he wants us to
34:38
have freedom and according to our
34:40
constitution
34:41
we have every right to have church to
34:44
come together to meet
34:46
is that correct so when the other side
34:49
wants to wipe it out
34:51
disallow it abolish it and crush it that
34:54
should show you right there
34:55
they're lost they have already lost what
34:58
they want to plot and plan
35:00
i'm not willing for that to happen amen
35:05
and with all the prayers that have come
35:07
forth on behalf of this country
35:09
you need to know that when you pray they
35:11
fill these bowls before the altar of god
35:15
your prayers your worship fill these
35:17
huge bowls
35:19
and when they're full god tips them when
35:21
they're tipped
35:22
a whole new move of god comes to this
35:24
earth so what is about to happen
35:26
isn't crash and burn to be destroyed is
35:29
about to be
35:30
wiped clean of the evil and a powerful
35:33
move of god is about
35:34
to hit this country
35:36
[Applause]
35:42
and this is what the one who made
35:43
everything is saying
35:45
amen his words count above the others
35:48
right
35:49
amen but jesus christ wants
35:52
is he not is not the earth his and the
35:55
bones thereof
35:56
the earth is who the lord
35:59
and the fullness thereof
36:02
then if it is his and he's already got
36:05
this time planned who do you think is
36:07
going to win
36:09
jesus it doesn't matter how bad it looks
36:12
or sounds
36:14
and i would encourage everybody to stop
36:15
watching the fake news
36:19
because they plotted and planned to
36:21
brainwash people all along
36:24
they understand how that works and they
36:26
have done that to many people
36:28
i have family members i have friends
36:30
that listen to it
36:31
and all they know is this they hate
36:33
trump they can't even tell you why they
36:35
hate it they just know they hate him
36:37
right and so they're brainwashed into
36:40
thinking
36:40
he's so bad they gotta vote for the
36:42
other side they don't even know what the
36:43
other side stands for
36:45
i know i met somebody the other day
36:47
before i came
36:48
oh i like who's in there now i said you
36:50
like evil
36:53
you want terrorists to come into our
36:55
country
36:56
without any boundaries you want human
36:59
trafficking and drugs to keep
37:01
rushing into our country without anyone
37:03
stopping them
37:04
you want law and order taken away so
37:06
people can come and burn your place or
37:08
take whatever they want to from you
37:10
and they're looking at me really strange
37:11
well that's not what's going to happen i
37:13
said they've already signed papers
37:16
are you not listening to what they're
37:18
saying
37:19
oh no i just know they're good and trump
37:21
is bad
37:25
and that's what some people think they
37:28
don't have a clue
37:30
because they were taught for all those
37:32
years continually
37:34
when the same thing is put into you over
37:36
and over again in your soul and you
37:37
don't stop it
37:38
or you don't lose it from there it
37:40
builds in you
37:42
as a man thinketh in his heart that's
37:45
your soul
37:46
so is he that means what you let
37:50
in is what you will become
37:53
your heart he talks about the bible all
37:55
the time isn't this human beating heart
37:58
it's the core the word heart means the
38:01
core of something
38:03
the center of something the core of your
38:04
being is your soul
38:07
you are a soul that's what god said when
38:09
he made adam he became a
38:11
living soul that is very key
38:16
the other thing the body of christ needs
38:17
to learn is what does that mean
38:19
why is my soul so important why do you
38:21
think he says to guard it
38:24
you decide what goes in there you decide
38:26
what you watch
38:27
what you hear and what you say
38:30
and all three of those things will
38:32
affect who you are
38:34
that's what will come out of you what
38:36
you allow in there
38:39
if you don't like you maybe you should
38:40
change what you're saying or what you're
38:42
watching
38:44
because it will influence your soul is
38:47
your mind what you think about
38:49
your will what you choose and your
38:51
emotions
38:52
how you respond to all that what do you
38:54
act out in your life
38:56
what do you actually say about you are
38:59
you manifesting from christ
39:01
his character his purposes his words
39:04
clearly written
39:08
because that's what he wants from us the
39:10
world should look at us
39:12
and see christ when they hear us they
39:14
should hear christ
39:16
is that right does christian mean
39:19
christ's life then we need to start
39:22
acting like that
39:24
because when you do you terrify the
39:26
devil
39:28
if he can't crush you and put fear in
39:31
you which has always been his greatest
39:32
weapon
39:33
his second greatest weapon is deception
39:37
he's been working overtime with
39:38
deception
39:40
deceiving people taking up parts of the
39:42
word making whole bibles that
39:44
left hope books of the bible out or
39:47
twist what they say
39:49
i tell people make sure if you read the
39:50
word of god it's got the whole counsel
39:52
of god
39:55
there's some that take out the the
39:57
millennial reign of christ
39:59
they even take out the tribulation some
40:01
of them even say it's okay to sin
40:06
and there's some people never heard any
40:07
of this before but it's true
40:10
because the enemy is doing whatever he
40:12
can to deceive us
40:13
amen and obviously some people have been
40:16
deceived by believing
40:18
a lie so i don't work for hell
40:22
i don't represent hell i have nothing to
40:25
do with hell
40:26
there's no darkness in me i do not
40:28
tolerate any acts or words or thoughts
40:31
of the enemy
40:32
yes yes i serve the most high god and
40:36
him alone will i serve
40:39
it's okay with me if people don't like
40:40
my pink hair they will be taken to the
40:43
welcome center when they get to heaven
40:47
because you see people with every color
40:49
of hair in heaven
40:52
that's where the rainbow lives
40:56
and the one who carried you you lived in
40:59
that rainbow before you came here
41:02
you had a little spirit of life that was
41:03
your little spirit person
41:05
lived in the father that's why we are
41:08
his offspring you wrote on the rays of
41:12
the rainbow in and out of him
41:14
you played in the river of life inside
41:16
of him you jumped on the stones of fire
41:19
that burn with passion for you and
41:21
online
41:22
and that river of life goes over those
41:24
those gemstones massive gemstone filled
41:27
with a fire
41:28
it shoots that rainbow out of him
41:32
you lived there
41:36
so he made a plan with the words
41:39
on how to bring redemption how to bring
41:41
mankind back
41:43
to him in heaven some of the angels
41:46
still call jesus christ the word
41:49
you all know what the bible says the
41:51
word was with god
41:53
and was god and there was nothing that
41:55
was made that was not
41:57
made by him he had flesh put on
42:02
him he agreed to come and die and that
42:05
put on that cross and carry to that
42:07
cross
42:08
every sin wicked evil
42:12
act word intentions he drank it in the
42:16
cup in the garden
42:18
even when he didn't want to did he give
42:21
up his will
42:23
did he say to the father not my will but
42:26
your will be done and he drank all that
42:28
evil
42:29
he died in the garden when he
42:32
surrendered himself
42:33
because it wasn't just his body that had
42:35
to hang on that cross
42:38
every evil act and sin
42:41
had to be put on that cross and someone
42:44
who was perfect and holy
42:45
had to carry that to the cross he was
42:49
guiltless
42:50
he was innocent no sin
42:53
in his life even when he walked on this
42:55
earth
42:56
and yet he was willing to take that in
42:58
him that
43:00
is why he is the only one
43:03
who can forgive your sins because he
43:06
took
43:07
those sins to the cross there's no other
43:10
being that can do that for you there's
43:12
no other religion out there
43:14
that can say that you can get into
43:16
heaven
43:18
he is your way back to the father and
43:21
part of his reward was when you die
43:23
and moved to heaven you're not lost
43:26
you didn't lose somebody they moved
43:30
jesus christ is to walk you up the steps
43:33
of the throne
43:34
and say hear father i have brought your
43:36
son
43:37
or your daughter back to you
43:42
that is why heaven rejoices and throws
43:45
the biggest
43:46
party ever every time someone comes home
43:50
because
43:50
jesus is going to get to do that that's
43:53
part of his reward
43:56
he loves to call you to get undone and
43:58
when you step out of whatever you came
44:00
in whether it's one of heaven's
44:01
elevators whether it's a starship or
44:04
it's christ's
44:05
chariot there's many ways he can take
44:07
you up to heaven
44:09
when you get out you'll step into the
44:11
river of life right there coming out of
44:13
the city
44:13
and he will start throwing water on you
44:18
and you will have a water fight
44:21
that's what you will have and you're
44:23
going to see people
44:24
dancing and singing all over even
44:27
outside the gates
44:28
they'll be celebrating there's music
44:31
everywhere
44:32
the flowers sing the trees seeing the
44:35
ground is alive
44:36
the sky is alive and you're stepping
44:39
into life
44:40
and some people like i thought we
44:42
couldn't play music
44:46
i thought it was going to be silent in
44:48
heaven
44:49
that was only one dime it was only one
44:52
time it was silent in heaven
44:54
that was it not since then
44:59
you look for someone to be quiet you'll
45:00
find a place and then the trees will
45:02
start talking to you
45:04
or the rocks or the creatures
45:09
there's life everywhere so they have
45:11
actually got a welcome center i'm not
45:13
making it up
45:14
you're going to laugh even harder when
45:15
you see the humor of god
45:19
this whole family i knew growing up in
45:21
our city that owned
45:22
all the funeral homes were strong
45:25
believers they had compassion and
45:27
kindness for people
45:29
and one of the heads of all that was
45:31
about ready to go home to heaven and god
45:33
had me take this paper scroll
45:37
paper and write in gold ink his word for
45:40
that man
45:42
that was ready for me to get a word for
45:44
a person i usually prophesied
45:46
corporately
45:47
and i took it to the funeral home he was
45:49
even in his 90s he was still there
45:51
greeting people's families he had known
45:54
for a long time
45:55
and he's about to go inside and i said
45:56
richard could i give you something
45:59
and he said well what do you have i said
46:01
i have a word from god for you and he
46:03
started to cry
46:06
on the sidewalk he said all my years of
46:10
living
46:10
and caring and loving no one has ever
46:13
given me a word from god
46:14
[Music]
46:16
i said well he's gonna tell you your
46:18
future in heaven
46:20
gonna tell you what you're gonna be
46:21
doing and god wrote all these beautiful
46:24
words about him about
46:26
he had been given a heart to care and
46:28
great compassion
46:29
and understanding to help people go
46:31
through a
46:32
time in their life and god said you
46:35
always got them
46:36
when they were going to heaven but now
46:41
you will get them when they're coming to
46:43
heaven because i'm putting you
46:45
and all your family in charge of the
46:46
welcome center
46:50
and this is the hillary said you may
46:52
tell everybody
46:53
that you now your family now gets them
46:56
going and coming
47:02
and he was so undone and i said god
47:06
would not let me just speak that word to
47:08
you he has this scroll prepared
47:11
as if he had handwritten himself it was
47:14
this beautiful paper parchment paper
47:16
i said this is your word and when you go
47:19
home in a couple of weeks
47:21
she said you'll be going in a couple of
47:23
weeks you can let your brother know
47:25
who's remaining
47:26
what his future will be i said when he
47:29
said that to me
47:30
right yeah he took me up to heaven i saw
47:33
your brothers they all look alike
47:35
i saw your brothers i saw your father in
47:38
this beautiful building
47:39
and i saw people when they would get out
47:41
of these transports and they're like
47:42
this
47:44
[Laughter]
47:47
and they would walk in and say come on
47:49
we're going to make it all okay
47:52
yes you're in heaven i know it's more
47:54
than you ever dreamed just come with us
47:55
and we're going to explain
47:57
and they had such compassion and
47:59
kindness for the people
48:02
and i love to tell that story because it
48:04
shows you the humor of god
48:06
but the reward of god he doesn't forget
48:09
the kind acts that you do
48:11
so i actually can say and you can say
48:13
you know who's running the welcome
48:14
center
48:15
it is the heritage family from the
48:17
hardest people
48:21
and and i went to visit him once when he
48:23
was in the hospice and i took him a
48:25
picture of the portal in heaven i've
48:27
been taken to
48:28
where people look down and see their
48:30
families and they can declare over them
48:32
they go every year to sing happy
48:33
birthday to you from from heaven
48:36
and it's a beautiful place i was taken
48:37
to they have them all over heaven
48:39
and i i put that right beside where he
48:41
was lying so he could look at it
48:43
and he said i will never forget your act
48:45
of kindness that you gave me god's word
48:48
when i needed it the most and he said i
48:50
am so looking forward to running the
48:52
welcome center
48:55
[Applause]
48:58
and about a week after i went by there i
49:00
was driving down the road and i knew
49:02
where that
49:02
where he was and that beat this
49:04
beautiful hospice place
49:06
and i actually saw him leaving with
49:08
angels being taken up to heaven
49:11
and god said look to the right and he
49:13
said richard's leaving
49:16
because i was obedient he allowed me to
49:18
see him
49:19
leaping and so i was very blessed so i
49:22
started calling people richard richard
49:24
heart just went to heaven
49:26
before anyone else knew he went to
49:28
heaven i just saw him he's leaving
49:29
forever people are used to that for me
49:32
and then they said then they had a head
49:33
on the news because he was well known
49:35
all the city uh we we
49:37
we mourn the passing of richard harter
49:40
to this day such that
49:42
and i want thank you god for letting me
49:43
see that
49:45
so they celebrate from the time they
49:47
step out of that old body
49:49
this body is part of you it's what
49:53
sleeps
49:54
but you your spirit man never sleeps
49:57
even when you're sleeping now
49:59
your soul never sleeps that's a
50:01
spiritual part of you your soul is awake
50:03
you play music christian music at night
50:06
you're feeding your soul
50:07
if you play the word of god at night
50:09
somewhere that's feeding your soul
50:12
even things that like learning or
50:14
mentoring tapes you're
50:15
feeding your spirit man that's going in
50:18
your soul
50:19
what you hear goes in your soul
50:22
and it can begin to change you some
50:25
people i can't sleep in music i have it
50:27
going 24 hours a day in my place
50:29
in more than one room i want to saturate
50:33
my walls i can walk in my home
50:35
even if it's not on and i hear the music
50:37
that plays all the time that remains in
50:39
the room
50:40
your words remain in your rooms where
50:44
you live
50:45
sometimes i walk in someone's home and
50:47
hear things i don't like
50:50
i'll step outside and i'll pray over
50:52
them and break the enemy
50:54
off at their home images remain in your
50:57
home by stuff you watch
51:02
we need a great understanding of our
51:04
soul
51:06
your soul doesn't sleep okay you feed it
51:10
24 hours a day
51:13
your body gets fed three times a day
51:15
sometimes five times a day
51:17
in america probably five times or more
51:20
and now you're all eating
51:22
cake so you can add that to your wrist
51:27
so your body gets fed several times a
51:29
day right your spirit man god said
51:31
sometimes once a week
51:40
i feed mine every day i make sure my
51:43
spirit man
51:44
gets back the word of god whether i
51:46
listen to it whether i read it
51:48
or i listen to powerful speakers online
51:50
now we got the internet
51:52
god designed the internet by the way not
51:54
the devil it does not belong to the
51:56
devil amen
51:59
and these words of god coming literally
52:01
some people will have angelic beans come
52:03
out of their computers
52:07
this is a portal
52:10
this is a portal it is a portal
52:14
your computer is a portal your ipad is a
52:16
portal whatever can carry images
52:19
or transmit stuff it can transmit heaven
52:23
or the other place you need to be
52:26
careful what you put on here amen
52:29
i'll be somewhere and i'll see things up
52:30
like i'll see things come right out of
52:32
the tv
52:33
i'm very careful i need to tissue
52:35
somebody
52:37
i'm very careful about what my eyes see
52:41
okay i don't want to put stuff in my
52:43
soul it doesn't belong there
52:44
i'm going to keep it sorry i'm going to
52:47
keep my soul pure
52:49
i want it pure and it's not that hard
52:52
it's a lifestyle
52:57
being like christ should be a lifestyle
52:59
it's not a sunday thing
53:02
although i'm thankful people actually go
53:04
on sunday of course some people can't
53:06
even go on sunday now but i want you
53:07
know california
53:09
is breaking all the rules right now
53:12
california has had it with the lockdowns
53:17
that's right and i noticed he's been
53:20
speaking about america and that's what
53:21
i'm leading up to
53:23
you have to remember what the father
53:25
said
53:26
okay the enemy is not in power right now
53:30
in this country
53:32
it is not god still is trump still
53:35
is he is a president he is the one who's
53:39
in power he is in office
53:41
so when the righteous are in office or
53:44
they're in power
53:45
the people rejoice that's why he's
53:46
telling everybody to eat cake
53:48
amen the worst thing you can do to the
53:51
enemy
53:52
right now is to
53:55
you celebrate like it's already happened
53:57
you know what this scripture says
53:59
call those things that be not as though
54:02
they were
54:03
that means you act like they've already
54:05
happened
54:06
so if you believe victory is coming and
54:09
it is then you should act like it
54:13
he sets a table
54:16
a table is what you eat from
54:20
it's what you celebrate from that's what
54:22
he's saying he's saying that scripture
54:23
even the myth of every one thing around
54:25
you
54:26
he can set a temple of celebration for
54:29
your life
54:30
and it missed everything around you and
54:32
that will begin to combat
54:34
darkness because the enemy sees he's not
54:38
winning hallelujah
54:41
our life gets brighter that he put in us
54:43
when he got born again you got part of
54:45
the light of god put in you
54:47
some people's light would blind the
54:48
enemy some of you can already see it
54:53
when you begin to stand for what is
54:55
right and you don't step back
54:57
that life society begins to blind the
54:59
enemy and he gets
55:00
terrified and i ask the father what else
55:05
can they do they
55:06
prayed they fasted they laid on their
55:08
face
55:09
they've encouraged people and he said
55:11
they can eat cake and celebrate
55:14
[Applause]
55:18
and every time he's called me up to
55:20
heaven guess what they're doing
55:22
they're eating cake
55:26
because they've already seen the victory
55:28
happen
55:29
amen the father's been from the
55:31
beginning to the end in the end of the
55:33
beginning
55:34
and then he'll let you know you were
55:35
there too
55:38
before he made this earth
55:41
and he sent you from himself he had
55:44
already been from the end of the
55:45
beginning the beginning of the end he'd
55:47
already been there you were in him
55:50
when he went there and made things you
55:52
were in him
55:53
living in him you've already been
55:56
yourself
55:57
from the beginning to the end and the
55:58
end to the beginning
56:01
because you're you're eternal beings we
56:04
are eternal
56:06
amen you're born again one day you'll be
56:09
immortal
56:11
immortal means you can't sin you can't
56:13
get sick
56:14
you can't die that's your future
56:18
some of those behind that barbed wire
56:19
will not have that future
56:23
amen so these are great days that we're
56:26
living in
56:28
but the father chose to explain things
56:30
to you
56:31
so it's perfectly clear to you like it
56:34
is to him
56:36
our country has a great future
56:39
because it will impact this world we
56:43
will be we'll we will be
56:45
changers atmosphere changers amen
56:49
we walk into place because of christ in
56:52
us
56:52
the atmosphere will change
56:56
smith wigglesworth used to walk into
56:57
places and people would fall on their
56:59
face begin to cry out to god
57:01
that was a measure the measure he's
57:04
given us now is beyond that original
57:07
measure
57:08
you drive past people's homes and
57:10
they'll in your homes fall
57:12
out under the glory
57:16
people will see your roofs on fire
57:18
because the fire of god in you
57:20
in your home
57:24
people will walk in and out of the walls
57:26
to go speak someplace
57:27
one day i won't come by plane i'll walk
57:30
through the wall and come right out on
57:31
the platform
57:35
these are greater days of glory that
57:36
we're entering into
57:38
and he has to expose the evil and it has
57:42
to be dealt with
57:43
it can't be taken off the earth at this
57:45
time but it will be crushed back
57:49
and we will rule with great authority
57:51
and dominion we were given it by christ
57:54
jesus
57:55
he never let anything stop him in this
57:58
earth
57:59
not even time he was over time
58:03
he would step in the spirit realm and
58:05
walk through the people
58:07
he didn't walk around the people i've
58:09
been to the amount of the precipice i've
58:11
been there
58:12
i was in israel last year
58:16
on the tour that they bushwhacked me
58:17
with because
58:19
no one told me i'd have to be on the bus
58:21
at 8 am
58:22
[Laughter]
58:24
when i laid down at 7 am and no one told
58:28
me as the speaker of this tour to 18
58:31
places in israel i climbed the mountains
58:34
i went down inside of mountains
58:36
i've been to every significant place in
58:38
israel the dimensions in the bible
58:41
and i thought i was going to have a nice
58:42
place to speak in the hotel and
58:44
i do a couple meetings a day and i have
58:46
to go here my husband was laughing the
58:48
whole time and i tell them steve showed
58:50
someone you bushwhacked me
58:53
they hooked a microphone on me and
58:55
recorded everything he said wherever god
58:57
says the prophets i do it
58:59
well he had something to say everywhere
59:00
i went
59:04
where the fire came down before elijah
59:07
i got to speak on the sea of galilee
59:10
they had a fox so thick the boat
59:11
couldn't leave so i
59:12
commanded the fog to lift and it was
59:14
gone in three minutes
59:17
i don't tolerate the weather being over
59:19
me
59:20
it wasn't over christ was it right
59:26
he was not afraid of anything in the
59:27
enemy the enemy would run from him the
59:29
demons would scream when he would be
59:31
around them
59:33
and he walked as a righteous man on this
59:35
earth he chose
59:36
he had to choose with his will he had to
59:38
live just like us
59:40
he was still the son of god but he's
59:42
also called the son of man
59:44
he's appointed with every single thing
59:46
that we're tempted with
59:48
or attacked with and yet he was
59:51
victorious
59:52
in every way in his life why because he
59:55
was setting an example for us
59:58
you can live that way i live that way
60:03
it's different but it's fun
60:06
it's fun to walk holy because you choose
60:08
to be holy people say you can't be holy
60:11
i said the bible says we can
60:14
it says he's coming for a church this is
60:16
one of the reasons why he's not coming
60:17
right now
60:18
should be pretty evident the world
60:22
will know us by our love for
60:26
each other i challenge you to go talk to
60:30
some worldly people and ask them if you
60:31
think the church loves one another
60:35
it says in the bible they will know us
60:38
by our love for each other
60:40
so guess what he's not coming right now
60:42
roll up your rapture rug and stick in
60:43
the closet
60:47
it clearly says the wealth of the wicked
60:50
and they sure have a lot
60:51
that's been pretty evident for everybody
60:54
the wealth of the wicked is laid up for
60:55
the just and the righteous that has not
60:57
been transferred yet are you willing to
60:59
leave without that
61:05
it says even by christ himself the works
61:07
i did you will do how many people do you
61:09
know are walking on water
61:13
raising the dead that stinks they're in
61:15
the grave so long
61:18
making food appear everywhere wherever
61:20
they need it to appear
61:22
stepping in a boat and transporting it
61:24
in time itself
61:26
stepping in the spirit room and walking
61:28
through places
61:32
we need to already be doing that because
61:34
those greater
61:35
works are coming rapidly when you will
61:38
raise the dead of the funeral that was
61:40
cremated
61:42
where you will stop an earthquake that
61:44
started until it to put it back the way
61:46
it was before it came
61:53
where you tell the weather what it can
61:55
and cannot do
62:03
we have to be ready for those things
62:04
because he's not holding them back
62:06
once he does this what he is going to do
62:10
is setting the platform for us he's not
62:13
doing it just to bless the world it is
62:15
for the body of christ
62:17
to step up and be who we were called to
62:19
be you were born here because he wants
62:22
you here
62:24
you're an american you're here to
62:25
represent god himself
62:29
that's why he made america he calls it
62:31
his gift
62:33
his first gift was his son his second
62:36
gift to the world was america
62:40
where people walk in righteousness and
62:43
they have
62:43
liberty and freedom and justice in their
62:46
country
62:47
where they honor and respect him
62:50
and they're not ashamed of who he is
62:56
the moral majority in this country did
62:58
vote on november 3rd
63:00
and they chose justice liberty and
63:03
freedom
63:05
we didn't choose the other stuff that
63:07
the devil tried slipping in
63:10
their lives are not going to be good
63:14
because they chose what was wrong and
63:16
they feed upon people
63:18
and they destroy people they want to
63:20
crush our country
63:21
they want to make it into a third world
63:23
country they
63:25
don't care about anybody's color of
63:28
their skin
63:30
they care about nothing but evil and
63:32
wickedness
63:34
hurting and harming they will use
63:37
anything they can to make their point
63:41
and they will lie every time they do it
63:44
so god is not tolerating what they have
63:48
said will happen
63:50
it will not happen and it will not
63:53
remain
63:54
and it will not be forever it will not
63:56
be very long down the road
63:58
before what he showed me will happen he
64:01
showed me
64:02
when that freedom is announced he showed
64:04
me when they will be
64:06
forced to announce the election was
64:09
[Applause]
64:09
[Music]
64:10
stolen
64:14
for these four years
64:18
he needs to continue what he has started
64:21
god gave him to start in this country i
64:24
think he's going to be a little bit more
64:26
tempered
64:27
having had to see all the evil but i
64:29
promise you he despises evil
64:33
and when god first showed me trump he
64:35
said he is an
64:36
all-american boy who is all for
64:39
america that's how god himself described
64:42
him
64:44
and he has lived that before all of us
64:47
even with
64:48
a hate never and our history our country
64:51
has a president
64:51
been so wrongly accused and hated
64:55
and just people feed on that i mean they
64:58
feed evil feeds on that
65:00
and then when others came in to join
65:02
them and decided to
65:03
collude with them that means it became a
65:05
part of what they were planning
65:07
to block everything we said that was
65:09
truth
65:10
they wouldn't allow they don't want
65:12
people to know the truth they think if
65:13
they can keep the truth from being heard
65:15
that what they want will happen but
65:18
they're wrong about that too
65:21
some networks will be lost they won't
65:24
exist anymore because of the lies
65:27
they conspired to overthrow this country
65:31
anyone who committed conspiracy to
65:33
overthrow the presidency
65:35
or the overseer of the country are going
65:37
to prison
65:39
amen please
65:42
don't hear about already overseas
65:45
they're making arrests for those who
65:46
from other countries leaders of other
65:48
countries
65:49
people in high places in other countries
65:51
have already been arrested
65:55
and i think they're going to get as many
65:56
from there as they can and then they're
65:58
going to it's going to happen here
66:00
you will see you will see justice
66:03
justice will be served amen
66:06
[Applause]
66:10
to miss your destiny nor your future
66:13
amen it's just going to get greater and
66:17
greater in the days to come these are
66:19
not the days
66:20
of great darkness there will not be
66:22
cities burning other than the ones they
66:24
burned
66:25
their south and all those cities that
66:28
have been burned
66:29
people were paid to do that they were
66:32
all hired
66:34
even the people for black lives matter
66:36
antifa they have paid for
66:37
all of that to be done not to help
66:40
anyone
66:41
they're using them they even make
66:44
promises to china
66:46
for things and now people are wanting to
66:48
collect on the promises
66:51
so now some of them behind the barbed
66:52
wire are hiding
66:55
because they can't deliver what they
66:56
thought what they would already have in
66:58
their hand by now they thought we'll
66:59
have civil war
67:00
half the people will be dead we'll just
67:02
go in and collect everything and take
67:04
over
67:04
[Music]
67:05
we're not gonna have civil war we don't
67:08
want civil war
67:09
we have freedom we have our lives we
67:12
love our families
67:14
so they're never going to get us to do
67:15
that amen
67:17
and this is from the father they will
67:19
never get your guns
67:21
there's far too many red lakes in
67:26
america
67:34
he even shocks me sometimes
67:37
with some of the things that he says but
67:40
i have to agree because i know
67:42
some of those run nets
67:46
he said they'll never reach them they'll
67:48
be dead before they can get to them
67:53
one of the reasons why they haven't done
67:55
anything is we can still get them
67:57
because
67:58
we have our arms it's written in our
68:01
papers
68:02
we have the right to bear arms
68:05
is that correct
68:08
we have many freedoms and liberties
68:10
given to us in our constitution they're
68:12
trying to twist everything they can it's
68:14
still not gonna work
68:16
and until god i'm glad you're gonna do
68:17
something quicker
68:19
than later because the rednecks i'm
68:21
gonna wait much longer
68:25
my brother has a hotline to him
68:29
you haven't heard about my brother you
68:31
go back and look at some of those videos
68:32
you hear about him
68:35
he is all for justice he has to make out
68:38
himself he has a hotline from homeland
68:42
security and some other groups that are
68:44
organized
68:46
should they need their help
68:50
their guns are ready
68:53
and trump said there's a reason why i
68:55
said go home
68:56
and go home and stay
69:00
safe you know i will be back
69:04
he's trying to keep us you know not not
69:07
get upset
69:07
or not have fear come in us and the
69:10
other thing god
69:11
promised was he will take the virus off
69:14
the face of the earth
69:21
[Applause]
69:23
[Music]
69:25
devious purposes to bring heart to you
69:28
the social distancing was to keep us
69:31
apart so we wouldn't come together
69:33
although the bible is very clear don't
69:35
forsake the gathering together of
69:36
yourselves
69:38
and so he's against social distancing in
69:40
case you wonder he doesn't like it
69:42
there's no social distancing in heaven
69:44
and there's no mask
69:45
in heaven there's not even handshakes
69:48
choose only hugs
69:52
and i keep telling people we're gonna
69:53
have a mass burning party one day
69:59
i am not ignorant to the fact that there
70:01
are some people who have
70:03
compromised lives already you know they
70:06
have issues
70:07
if they want to wear them let them wear
70:09
them i'm not against them wearing them
70:11
i'm against me being forced to wear one
70:13
when i don't need what i
70:16
[Music]
70:21
and i don't like it every time they say
70:22
the new normal they can have them in
70:25
normal but it's not going to be in this
70:28
country
70:30
safer to apart no we're not safer apart
70:33
right that's never been true we're safer
70:36
together amen
70:38
we're here together we're in this
70:40
together
70:41
and we have a god who has a plan
70:44
he says he hasn't gone on dates everyone
70:46
else pip
70:47
so they've jumped off the wagon
70:51
they're wagging a victory in celebration
70:53
they just think we're just going to give
70:54
it and i'm not rolling over to anybody
70:59
no i'm not giving that up i know god has
71:02
a plan
71:03
and hang in there you're going to be
71:05
really happy
71:06
that you were some of the ones who said
71:08
all along victory is coming
71:10
and everyone will have to eat their
71:11
words
71:13
but they'll still be happy that we're
71:15
free amen
71:18
so you remember jesus who we belong to
71:21
and gave ourselves to
71:23
hold your life in his hand
71:26
no man holds your life in their hand
71:30
he wants us all to be free even the
71:33
bible said god never intended for
71:34
a person to be over us he wasn't all for
71:37
the kings at all
71:38
he didn't appoint kings man wanted a
71:41
king to be
71:42
maybe you didn't know that back in the
71:44
old days
71:45
they demanded to have a king be over
71:47
them
71:48
and so from that point on there's always
71:50
been leaders presidents
71:52
kings those in authority over people
71:55
that's why he said when the righteous
71:57
are in power the people rejoice because
72:00
they have a good one
72:01
when the wicked is they're not going to
72:03
rejoice amen
72:05
we are rejoicing amen
72:10
hallelujah so i won't talk but a few
72:13
minutes more
72:14
because you know i'm you know when i'm
72:16
finally awake which i'm kind of awake
72:19
you don't know but i'm actually sleeping
72:24
it's hard to get up in the morning for
72:26
me that's my that's my night time
72:29
and i tell people it's not the next day
72:30
until i go to sleep and i wake up
72:33
then it's the next day
72:36
my family has mostly adapted to the way
72:39
uh
72:39
my hours are i like that since i was
72:41
little my husband
72:43
used to go to sleep at ten o'clock no
72:44
matter what was going on he can hang in
72:46
there until midnight at least sometimes
72:48
one in the morning
72:49
my mom will hang in there to two or
72:51
three in the morning with me
72:53
she's gonna be 90 next year and she said
72:56
if she had her way she'd be taking a
72:57
plum switch up to that barbed wire
73:00
and be making some changes herself
73:04
[Laughter]
73:08
she's still my mom
73:11
and i'm blessed that she lives with me
73:13
but she definitely has her own opinions
73:15
about things
73:19
and she's not happy with it either but
73:21
she also understands
73:23
and she does pray for people people who
73:26
are seniors in certain situations in
73:28
their life
73:28
she prays all the time for them she
73:31
actually has an anointing for people for
73:33
married couples
73:34
that can't have children she's highly
73:36
anointed if she prays for you i have a
73:38
baby in nine months
73:40
it has happened over and over and over
73:42
usually when she comes to me she has her
73:44
own prayer line
73:47
so she's brought many babies from heaven
73:48
to earth by praying for people releasing
73:51
her anointing
73:52
to to bring them from heaven to earth
73:54
for god
73:55
she still does that she still prays for
73:57
people and it works
73:58
her faith is there she operates i
74:01
operate
74:02
you know in the revelation zone she
74:04
operates in the baby zone
74:08
so i i love what i do i love people i
74:11
can honestly say
74:12
i love you i love you with the father's
74:15
love
74:17
and he does have great plans for us and
74:19
i wish everyone
74:20
could hear these words he cares
74:23
he doesn't like sickness and disease he
74:26
doesn't like
74:27
anger he doesn't like violence he
74:29
doesn't like life being taken from us
74:31
that's nothing he purposed for us
74:35
and so if people don't know jesus christ
74:38
i will encourage anybody
74:39
watching right now that you make sure
74:42
you receive jesus christ as your savior
74:45
it gives you more than just hell
74:47
insurance okay
74:48
it gives you authority dominion it helps
74:51
you to step into the supernatural
74:53
and in these days of greater glory we'll
74:55
see things never seen before on the
74:57
earth with the signs and wonders that
74:58
will be done
75:00
people will be shocked and stunned to
75:02
see really the power of god in
75:04
us because of his son so i look forward
75:08
to seeing you all again
75:10
and i i pray that you have a blessed day
75:16
oh i'm absolutely going to be speaking
75:18
at the inaugural prayer breakfast okay
75:26
i got to pray for him back in 2000 when
75:29
they had the last
75:30
prayer breakfast i actually got to pray
75:32
for him for the vice president for their
75:34
families for the future of america
75:37
and i'm telling you god and don't and
75:39
you reserve your judgment
75:41
for pence okay
75:44
don't judge people when you don't know
75:46
everything
75:48
you don't understand covert activities
75:50
you don't know what's going on
75:52
so reserve your judgment for him okay
75:57
they're very close they really care for
75:59
each other i know people
76:00
in their administration so don't jump on
76:03
something because you see something or
76:05
hear something
76:06
you can't tell everything that's going
76:08
on especially if it's covert it won't be
76:10
covered
76:11
amen so we will see what is decided
76:15
about that what decisions are made
76:17
i do know that god did pick pence for
76:20
eight years also
76:21
like he did the president and i need to
76:23
let you know
76:24
that means if trump won the election
76:26
that means vice president pence
76:28
also won that election amen so we'll see
76:31
what god's going to do
76:33
i do want you to get ready to celebrate
76:35
in your life like you never have before
76:38
eat cake in moderation
76:42
and right now i had already asked them
76:46
if i could teach you a dance
76:50
[Applause]
76:55
if i if i could teach this dance to you
76:57
i'm kind of fine if i
76:59
actually have now i do have
77:03
music can you all play
77:06
everybody dance now can you dance now
77:10
i'm teaching them
77:27
you might have to play that one from
77:29
your phone
77:32
dancing
77:35
[Applause]
77:35
[Music]
77:42
everybody
77:50
i'm trying to stop it first because i
77:52
have to teach it to you first
77:56
because we can play it up here through
77:57
this pa system my husband's brother
78:10
now we're going to okay this first if
78:12
you go why do you do this because it's
78:14
heaven culture okay
78:16
uh church is supposed to be fun amen
78:20
it is god in heaven but when i started
78:23
speaking not only did i have to show up
78:25
with my pink hair which freaked out a
78:27
lot of pastors
78:28
i don't know why i thought you know and
78:30
i even knew like 40 some pastors in mine
78:32
was sitting they said
78:33
you've gone too far you fell off the
78:35
edge so now we can't work with you
78:43
it's just while some people will look
78:45
and go know that you don't qualify
78:47
anymore
78:48
well you know the holy spirit already
78:50
warned me
78:51
and he i actually saw angels doing this
78:53
dance that we're going to learn
78:55
in my own church we had a prophet
78:58
several prophets coming at a panel they
79:00
did a q a session
79:01
and all their angels were standing
79:03
behind them on the platform because i
79:05
see the angels
79:06
see all of yours by the way they're
79:07
excited because they you're going to do
79:09
this famous
79:10
they're going to be doing this dance
79:11
with you okay and so i saw them doing
79:14
this dance and i'm like well that's wow
79:16
that looks like
79:16
fun what was that the holy spirit said
79:19
they're doing the revelation dance
79:20
because the people have received
79:22
revelation this day and they're excited
79:25
and then i went to canada about two
79:26
weeks later and i was speaking with
79:28
people there we had four hour meetings
79:30
they would break for lunch and we'd come
79:32
back i said boy they did it
79:34
and and in the second meeting the
79:36
hospital said you're going to teach them
79:37
all that dance
79:40
what dance the humor in all this is
79:43
all three of my daughters their gift is
79:46
dance
79:48
they do ballet do all the traditional
79:50
beautiful stuff they're anointed people
79:52
been raised from the dead when they
79:54
dance they've been healed when they
79:55
dance
79:56
it is who they are and i don't dance at
80:00
all
80:00
i've been kicked out of jazzercise
80:02
classes okay
80:04
and now he's telling me all my daughters
80:06
laugh hysterically every time i talk
80:07
about it you have to teach them you're
80:09
teaching everyone in there this dance
80:11
because we want them to celebrate
80:13
they're going to learn to celebrate when
80:14
they receive revelation they need to
80:16
celebrate
80:17
and so i did and i think the only song i
80:19
at that time knew about was when the
80:21
saints come marching in
80:23
so i talked to him and so when i get
80:25
back to
80:26
where i live um i heard this music
80:30
and the holy spirit said that's the
80:32
music we want you to learn to teach it
80:33
to
80:34
them and that's that's that's a secular
80:36
song
80:38
he said yes but we like that song
80:42
we want everyone to tell us they're
80:43
going to dance when they get to heaven
80:45
they may as well practice now
80:47
and so ever since then i have taught
80:49
this dance to that song
80:51
and does anybody here know that dance
80:53
anyone
80:55
i know you do you really come up here if
80:58
anyone has done the students before
81:00
you can come up here a couple of you
81:01
come up here
81:26
everything on camera is going to be
81:28
doing this dance too
81:29
they will jump in and do it a lot of
81:31
them already know it it's actually
81:33
caught the revelation names but for some
81:35
reason
81:35
because i talked to my angels everybody
81:37
calls it if you google angel dance
81:39
it will bring up congregations all over
81:41
the world doing this dance
81:44
and so it's it has three movements
81:48
that's all i'll tell you what they each
81:50
mean and then i'll show you with you
81:52
the first one is that um i'm receiving
81:55
revelation it's treasure so i'm digging
81:57
up treasure
82:00
that's that's the first movement the
82:02
second one is i'm
82:03
celebrating the revelation
82:10
the third one is i'm gonna share it
82:12
everywhere
82:14
[Applause]
82:16
and i didn't know anything about counts
82:18
or beats or nothing okay i can't even
82:20
play a tina marine i was going off the
82:22
stage
82:25
that is not my gift i can't even keep me
82:27
to that
82:28
and so someone uh the holy spirit said
82:31
you gotta do to account
82:32
eight and i'm like
82:35
i was coming and then this angel appears
82:37
again when i wake up in the morning
82:39
which is noon this angel appears to me
82:42
in my room and he goes
82:43
watch i don't know if he was happy with
82:45
the assignment or not
82:48

82:49
thing and he was speaking he said wow

we're digging up revelation that's like
82:54
treasure you know he did it to the count
82:56
of eight
82:58

82:59

87:06
[Applause]
87:16
oh
87:31
i can tell you uh probably my hardest
87:34
group to teach
87:36
was a group of 80 baptist
87:39
ministers
87:42
[Applause]
87:44
god doesn't cut any i was invited in
87:47
canada they had a monthly prayer meeting
87:50
unit for like 15 years right they'd have
87:53
a guest speaker well they didn't tell
87:55
anybody
87:55
i was going to be there so when we got
87:58
there margaret and i sat at this table
87:59
we could see
88:00
eyes piercing us right who's this woman
88:04
with pink hair
88:07
i'm like margaret i think they got tired
88:09
feather
88:11
feathering in their mind and this little
88:13
guy gets up
88:14
and they all knew him because there was
88:18
a few catholics there there were a few
88:20
presbyterians a few but mostly
88:23
retired practice winners not even like
88:26
new young ones and by the time i got up
88:30
and i
88:31
introduced myself and and the guy played
88:34
his little accordion for worship
88:36
that wasn't enough to burn my flesh
88:49
all their angels were behind them
88:51
laughing so hard they could hardly stand
88:54
up
88:55
and so i said i was here to share heaven
88:58
they got to call me up in heaven
88:59
and they were like this
89:03
there was not one bit of emotion on
89:05
their faces they were so angry at the
89:08
the guy who was the head of the
89:09
breakfast and i said i'm just going to
89:11
press him
89:14
and i started talking about what it was
89:16
like to stand before the son of god
89:18
and of course in their mind i could read
89:20
it no one can stand see the face of god
89:22
then die
89:22
they would die i mean that's what was in
89:24
their minds and then about
89:26
five minutes in they started to cry
89:30
i saw tears coming down their eyes and
89:33
then across their arms
89:35
and they sat there they were so undone
89:38
by the love of god
89:40
and explaining what it was like to see
89:42
before him
89:43
and the ways of consuming passion that
89:45
came from him
89:46
and how you well he welcomed you home to
89:48
heaven as his son and daughter
89:50
no one cared in that room that i was a
89:53
woman
89:54
nobody cared i had pink hair they began
89:57
to shake
89:58
visibly shake sitting in their seats
90:00
because of the presence of the holy
90:02
spirit
90:02
they didn't even know they didn't know
90:04
how to respond they didn't know what to
90:05
do all they could do was shake
90:07
and then when we got vienna said now i'm
90:10
going to teach you something they do in
90:11
heaven by that time
90:13
they didn't care what i said i said so
90:15
heaven does this dance
90:17
angels do the same uh
90:20
revelation about heaven and about the
90:23
father and about his son
90:25
they do this dance would you all like to
90:27
learn this dance and they yelled at the
90:28
top of their lungs
90:29
yes
90:33
and we had our little computer with us
90:35
and we were going to plug it in to get
90:36
the music
90:37
that music and i said when we do it to
90:40
this music you may not understand but we
90:42
have to do
90:42
everybody dance now because you know
90:44
they don't dance in church they don't
90:46
raise hands in church
90:47
and i'll tell you before we were done
90:48
they were dancing raising their hands
90:52
and we couldn't get our music converted
90:54
so the little guy said well i can play
90:56
you know uh when the saints come
90:59
marching in
91:00
on my little thing
91:11
got up and learned that dance and they
91:13
were laughing and they were crying in
91:15
her hands
91:16
okay in the beginning when he did his
91:18
little recording thing he was saying
91:19
it's okay to raise your hand god won't
91:21
strike you down
91:22
and none of them raised their hand they
91:24
were all like
91:27
they were doing the whole thing the best
91:29
part was they were going to have a
91:31
second meeting
91:34
and they called all their friends you
91:37
have to come this person didn't say lady
91:40
this person has been the handwritten
91:42
talked about the throne of god
91:43
there was twice as many pastors in that
91:46
room
91:47
it was like there were 200 glasses in
91:50
that room and the animals couldn't
91:52
wait until i said now we're going to
91:55
learn a dance
91:58
it was life changing life changing for
92:01
all of them so
92:03
if they can do it you
92:06
can do it amen and we did that all over
92:09
america wherever i traveled in the world
92:12
everybody learned that dance and we know
92:15
some pastors that had it taken on
92:16
purpose
92:17
and they welcome people to the church
92:19
then they play the dance on the screen
92:21
and everybody gets up they either want
92:23
to stay or they want to leave
92:26
but heaven is like that they celebrate
92:28
all the time
92:30
you know and people love their life
92:32
there
92:33
they can't wait for you to get there
92:35
they make plans for you
92:36
they get these little things to actually
92:38
record places
92:40
that they go that they can keep that
92:42
they know you will love specifically to
92:44
go and see in heaven
92:45
so you're going to be really busy when
92:47
you get there amen
92:49
so the other thing i want to do is lay
92:52
hands on every person here
92:54
amen and i'm going to give out
92:56
importations to everybody
92:58
amen if you want it i promise you that
93:02
i'm
93:02
healthy and whole
93:06
but you know it says that that you get
93:08
implications by the laying on of hands
93:10
is that right
93:12
so i'm not going to mock laying my hand
93:14
on you i'm actually going to put my hand
93:15
on you right here
93:17
i'm going to release the love of god
93:22
so the way i usually do this is we get a
93:24
line going and you walk
93:26
i'll like i'll stand here and that line
93:28
will form all the way around
93:30
and you come up to me and i'm just going
93:32
to say come here honey
93:35
are you just come up here and i'll go i
93:37
i impart the
93:38
love of god into you and it will go from
93:41
here because i operate in it it'll go
93:44
here into your heart
93:45
okay and you'll begin to feel his
93:47
presence
93:48
in you so and remember whatever it is
93:51
you need from him because this is from
93:53
him
93:54
you can ask for if you need healing if
93:57
you need finances
93:58
if you need you know things in your mind
94:01
restored whatever it is you can ask me
94:03
for it at that moment okay
94:05
so oh and make sure you say i receive it
94:08
okay everybody practice i receive it
94:11
and that's you saying yes that you do
94:13
accept that so
94:15
remember you have not because you asked
94:16
not so by coming being willing to come
94:19
up here
94:19
you're saying you're going to have it
94:22
amen
94:23
so we need to get that line somebody
94:25
needs to get that line
94:27
going maybe i think we usually start
94:29
where we start from the back or the
94:31
front i don't remember
94:33
yeah so i think the last the last row
94:37
come around here and just get in line
94:39
right here and as you receive it just go
94:41
back and sit down
94:42
this doesn't take very long because i'm
94:46
not going to go to every person and take
94:48
hours to do that okay this is an
94:50
accelerate
94:51
accelerated way to receive we're
94:54
entering into accelerated days so
94:56
it won't take very long to do that all
94:58
right
95:02
that's what i was thinking

00:00
[Applause]
00:07
if you see me making hand motions i'm
00:09
copying the angels in the room
00:13
they never are stagnant
00:17
they're always moving they're always
00:19
moving and so they really loved
00:22
anything that worships the lord
00:26
every time they go wild leaving in the
00:29
throne room when
00:29
when you're worshiping or adoring jesus
00:32
christ
00:33
just for a while but a lot of them they
00:35
were going like this well most of them
00:36
were going like this
00:40
except the ones behind her one behind
00:43
her was going
00:47
so i have to call you when i'm watching
00:49
it's hard not to do it
00:51
the throne room is a powerful powerful
00:54
place
00:55
it is so amazing to have been there and
00:58
the seraphim when the seraphim starts
01:00
singing
01:00
they come out of the glory cloud over
01:02
the throne and their hair is on fire
01:04
it's like blue fire
01:05
and they sing and they sing and they
01:07
sing and they sing
01:09
i keep inviting them to come so if they
01:11
ever showed them though your hair
01:12
probably turned blue and catch on fire
01:17
there's some of the fire carriers in the
01:19
throne room but to be there on purpose
01:21
there's nothing like
01:23
no one is up there crying that they
01:27
died as hard as that might seem to you
01:31
to imagine
01:32
they're not no one's crying no one is
01:36
sad
01:37
no one is grieving no one remembers
01:40
anything
01:41
bad that rhyme that wasn't me his holy
01:43
spirit
01:45
they they don't they're so in the glory
01:48
really and that thing about for all of
01:52
sin that comes short of the glory of god
01:54
it's not about you committing sins
01:56
i hear that you know if they don't have
01:57
revelation they don't understand what
01:59
that means
02:00
that means you you should be carrying
02:03
the glory
02:04
you should be carrying the glory you
02:05
should be carrying it for him releasing
02:07
it for him
02:08
it comes out of you like shockwaves
02:09
begin to permeate
02:11
everything it touches every person every
02:13
place
02:14
we we we don't do that we don't know how
02:16
to do that
02:17
it's something we'll do now in this time
02:21
you are in one of the most important
02:24
times on the face of the earth one of
02:26
the most blessed times regardless of
02:28
what your i see your ears here no
02:31
you were chosen from the beginning of
02:33
time to be here you were meant to be
02:35
here
02:38
all of your family members are so
02:40
excited you're here
02:41
amen you're not looking at the mass
02:44
you're not looking at the virus which is
02:46
you know
02:46
pretty much gonna be taken off the face
02:48
of the earth by god
02:51
it's being used against everybody it
02:53
really is
02:54
i'm not saying it's not there i'm not
02:56
saying it hasn't touched some people
02:58
but it's nothing like what they're
03:00
saying it is
03:01
you need to know the truth i bring the
03:05
truth i have to speak the truth okay
03:08
all of this that you're living in now
03:10
will be like
03:11
dust in a very short time
03:22
acceleration in this world
03:26
and not just america this whole thing is
03:28
yes
03:29
it's here we know it's here uh we we
03:31
talk about it we share what do we do
03:33
but let me tell you it's worldwide what
03:35
god is going to do
03:38
he he is planning and his plan will take
03:42
place
03:43
it will say it will say god's will
03:47
god's way not man's way
03:51
not the enemy's way it will be god's way
04:00
this country will be known by the glory
04:03
of god
04:04
the presence of god
04:10
and he's setting it up
04:13
you yes to understand there's covert
04:15
operations in heaven
04:16
and there's covert operations on earth
04:20
and maybe you don't know all that but
04:21
yes things are happening you cannot see
04:24
but you will see them suddenly say
04:26
suddenly
04:28
it will all be known say everything will
04:31
be known
04:34
all the stuff about the elections will
04:36
be known
04:43
[Applause]
04:53
and we will celebrate
04:56
[Applause]
05:04
and i know wonderful people talk about
05:06
revivals
05:08
a lot of people talk about moves of god
05:11
a revival is kind of i don't want to say
05:13
stagnant
05:14
but it's kind of centralized in certain
05:16
places what's coming isn't going to be
05:18
centralized
05:21
moves of god will come together to
05:23
create one
05:25
thing and that is called a habitation
05:29
say habitation is what is coming
05:34
it can't be controlled it can't be
05:37
stopped
05:39
and it can't be changed it's coming from
05:43
heaven
05:45
and we will be the habitation
05:50
no one can move us or take
05:53
us from the place god puts us
05:59
so no matter how people are putting it
06:01
what really is coming is a habitation of
06:03
god
06:04
yes that has never happened before on
06:08
the face of the earth
06:09
and you will not just get delivered
06:12
you'll get to share it you get to
06:13
experience it you get to carry it say
06:15
carry it
06:17
say the knowledge of the glory
06:20
will happen because we
06:24
will carry that glory all over this
06:27
world
06:30
so don't think of yourself of being left
06:32
out okay
06:33
that's not possible say if i'm alive
06:37
and breathing i'm part of it
06:44
that's how it's gonna be this time amen
06:46
amen say for
06:48
generations step out of your box and
06:52
just say it for generations
06:55
until god is done the boy will grow and
06:59
build
07:00
and cover the whole earth like the
07:03
waters cover the sea
07:06
the world will know there is a god
07:11
and they better decide amen
07:18
the other thing that i know is truth we
07:20
can all say this together
07:23
nothing that was done
07:26
through cheating stealing
07:30
lying unjust
07:34
accusations will not escape
07:38
being brought to justice
07:44
[Applause]
07:51
and let me tell you the god side knows a
07:54
whole lot that's been going on that
07:55
maybe you don't know
07:57
and i am talking about trump
08:01
that's okay if you're not okay come
08:03
outside we'll get you saved
08:09
and you know the person who likes him
08:12
the least is the devil
08:15
truly the one who's most terrified of
08:18
him of trump
08:19
is the devil say the devil doesn't like
08:22
him
08:23
maybe i should
08:28
one of the few presidents who has said
08:30
to the people i'm here to give your
08:31
country back to you
08:33
and i'm here to welcome jesus back into
08:35
the white house
08:41
he wasn't always perfect everyone knows
08:43
that especially the fake news but
08:45
they're stuck
08:46
on it they all they do is hit replay
08:51
and i've traveled all over the world
08:53
when all that stuff started people were
08:54
what's wrong with your news i want
08:56
nothing not my news
08:59
and not my news by the way you'd be
09:01
better off not listening
09:03
to anybody okay they know that they can
09:06
brainwash you they know that they can
09:08
compromise your soul to believe
09:10
exactly what they're saying and that's
09:12
why they keep
09:14
saying it if you've never heard things
09:16
about people that have gotten
09:18
brainwashed
09:18
that's how they do it they get you in a
09:22
place
09:23
so you will believe what they're saying
09:24
then they'll say it over and over and
09:27
over and guess what's going to come out
09:28
of your soul
09:29
say as a man thinketh in his heart
09:32
that's his soul so is he
09:36
that's what's happened to all of them
09:39
their souls have been compromised
09:41
they know it okay the darkness knows it
09:44
all the others who are part of all that
09:46
mess they all know that
09:48
and that's why they keep it going that's
09:50
why they don't want the truth to be
09:52
known
09:54
that's why they don't want us saying
09:55
anything that's why they block you or be
09:58
in you whatever they're doing
09:59
they're so terrified that people will
10:03
hear the truth and begin to believe it
10:06
they don't want them i know i know i
10:08
have i have really close friends
10:10
who just did that they fed on it they're
10:12
not the same people
10:14
they're not the same people that's why
10:15
every now and then anyway free soul
10:17
checkup
10:18
and i offer help to all those out there
10:20
who have been compromised
10:23
lose it from your soul
10:26
and i'm really serious about that he
10:28
made us that we can
10:29
loose things remember the keys of the
10:32
kingdom what you loose on earth
10:34
will be loose from heaven what you bind
10:36
on earth
10:37
can be bound on him loose all the bad
10:40
all the negative
10:41
all the hurt trauma tragedies
10:44
all of the fear all the fake news every
10:47
word you've ever heard lose it all from
10:48
your soul
10:49
heaven will come down and pull it out
10:52
and they really do that they will do
10:54
that i've seen people change in three
10:56
minutes from doing that
10:58
then then you bind the things of god i
11:00
choose my will to find the life of god
11:03
the love of god the presence of god his
11:05
will
11:06
his way his word i find the truth to my
11:09
soul
11:10
and there is no one on the earth that
11:12
can take it out of you
11:14
that's what they need to heal the world
11:17
actually needs a soul checkup right
11:20
so it's not that hard to be free
11:24
it's not number one you have to know
11:26
that you're not
11:28
you need to know when you've been
11:29
deceived because the devil for eons and
11:32
ages always use fear as his number one
11:34
weapon
11:34
now it's deception
11:38
it really is because when you say yes to
11:40
deception you're deceived
11:42
and when you're deceived you can't see
11:43
the truth understand the truth
11:45
or even want to know the truth so
11:49
this whole country and other people all
11:51
over the world
11:52
i always do those soul checkups if you
11:54
hear me doing it that's why i'm doing it
11:55
i want them to be free
11:56
right that's right and after the first
11:58
election i offered it free to all the
12:00
democrats
12:03
a post-election therapy i called it
12:08
to have your soul set free
12:11
and a lot of people did it and i have
12:13
that a lot of people call me contact let
12:14
me
12:15
play says hey i did that i'm free
12:19
we will get some new networks i promise
12:21
you the truth is
12:23
some of them will close and be shut down
12:25
we'll keep on with the truth okay
12:27
from the justice that's coming some of
12:30
them will lose their network
12:33
and you don't even know this but some
12:34
ceos have already started stepping down
12:38
the thing about deception is when you
12:40
aren't deceived and you willingly
12:42
knowingly
12:43
do what's wrong and you know commit
12:45
crime you're
12:46
quite aware that it just might not work
12:49
yeah
12:50
so this whole thing that they're doing
12:52
when they see isn't working
12:54
they just put more barbed wire around
12:56
them
12:59
he's not god they can't stop god
13:02
i'm not going to stop god
13:06
so i also knew this that when these
13:08
things the landslide
13:10
starts can't stop it that's called
13:12
justice amen
13:14
a lot of them will try to run some may
13:16
end their life
13:17
we need to pray for those people because
13:19
they don't want
13:20
they don't want what that word was
13:21
saying up there about the shame they
13:23
didn't want
13:23
people to know what they were doing but
13:25
everyone's going to know what everybody
13:27
was doing because it's already been
13:28
collected
13:29
amen and so they they have proof all the
13:33
proof they need
13:34
and i will just mention this for those
13:36
who don't know this is a truth
13:38
meeting how about that this is the truth
13:41
the truth is that they've already been
13:43
uh tried
13:45
in a different kind of a court and been
13:47
found um guilty
13:50
and uh in case you didn't know uh trump
13:52
is actually a president i just say that
13:58
he did win he wants anyone
14:02
they tried to steal it it's not going to
14:06
work
14:07
[Music]
14:08
and the crazy thing in all this is
14:10
they're trying they
14:11
when i say they i mean the left delivers
14:13
whatever you want to call them they
14:15
god calls me villains i'll just say what
14:16
he does the villains
14:18
we're hoping we would just give up and
14:20
do what they wanted
14:22
they forgot one thing we
14:25
we the people do not
14:29
a third world country where we are in
14:32
control
14:34
say we are free and we're staying free
14:37
man that made a big mistake and one
14:42
thing he didn't consider
14:44
that we wouldn't don't all dumb goblin
14:46
has happened
14:47
no they're not smart because we run
14:49
closer to him
14:52
we get closer to him we hear him clear
14:54
we become more dangerous against hell
14:57
that's what happens when you press on
15:00
god's people that's exactly what
15:01
happened so
15:02
mistake number one was that you thought
15:04
everybody would just dump god and give
15:06
him up
15:08
they don't know us say they don't know
15:09
us
15:11
they're about to find out amen
15:13
[Music]
15:14
so that was their first mistake the
15:15
second mistake is we're already free
15:18
we live free say we're free right now
15:22
we aren't bound get anything to villains
15:26
has written down his new laws
15:30
and i have to say this to you because
15:32
the father said this to him he said tell
15:33
them this please
15:34
it says when the righteous are in power
15:36
the people rejoice so why don't you
15:38
rejoice
15:41
because the truth is the humans
15:44
have no power they are not in power say
15:47
the villains
15:49
are not in power the righteous are in
15:52
power
15:53
so we're going to keep rejoicing while
15:56
they remove the others
16:01
the best show on earth jesus christ
16:03
wiping out hell
16:09
these are going to be glorious days and
16:11
i am so excited to be here
16:13
okay i got born again i i came out born
16:16
again i think
16:17
i do remember at age four receiving
16:19
christ and because i'm a senior i saw
16:20
him step inside of me
16:23
you can't tell a child is four years old
16:25
that he's not real and that doesn't
16:26
really happen
16:28
you're really more open to it than most
16:29
people when they get older it's a little
16:31
bit harder because your mind gets in the
16:32
way
16:35
i saw him step inside of me i liked it
16:37
so much when i turned five for my
16:38
birthday i did it all over again
16:41
this is how precious jesus he stepped
16:43
out to step back in
16:45
[Music]
16:47
for a birthday present
16:51
so living life with heaven all the time
16:53
is definitely different
16:54
i tell people all the time i'm i'm like
16:56
an eight-year-old if you pick on me
16:58
you're picking on nate road they forget
17:00
it really soon right
17:02
they see a pretty flower a crawling bug
17:04
or a piece of cake and they forget it
17:08
so he really did i i worked with ceos
17:11
most of the time i was
17:12
i love business i'm a business person
17:14
actually i'm a ceo hey
17:16
this is how we dress when you get in
17:18
here and having your ceo right
17:20
they're the best apparel ever you don't
17:23
get a nightgown in the bathrobe and
17:25
having people i hope you didn't
17:31
not for the one who owns everything
17:35
he's not going to give you that that's
17:37
not what people wear up there
17:38
you have an apparel wardrobe room it's
17:41
like a thousand square feet maybe more
17:43
than that
17:44
and every kind of beautiful amazing
17:46
thing because there's so many things to
17:48
do in heaven you can't ride a roller
17:50
coaster in a gown
17:53
in case you wonder i wouldn't try it
17:58
for so long i grew up in the church
18:01
trust me from the day i was born i was
18:03
in church
18:04
and i was there for every revival every
18:07
special visitor it didn't matter if it
18:08
lasted six weeks i was there every night
18:10
for six weeks along with all my siblings
18:13
and my parents would space the older
18:15
ones in between the younger ones you
18:16
know when you got 15
18:18
i mean several people i was i was an
18:20
adult at age eight
18:21
that's why he kept me video see i earned
18:23
it
18:24
because from that age i had to help take
18:26
care of my 12 of my siblings
18:29
everyone was a chief okay they were all
18:32
in charge
18:33
all highly anointed uh you know they
18:36
they needed to be tempered a whole lot
18:40
they practiced on me
18:45
and from a very young age i could see in
18:47
the spirit room i understood it
18:49
being the father son holy spirit i
18:51
remember when i invited the holy spirit
18:53
he came
18:53
inside me like a whirlwind and he's been
18:56
there ever since and i can tell you how
18:57
that happens
18:58
who wants to know how he can be
19:00
everywhere at the same time anybody want
19:01
to know
19:03
he has unlimited layers of himself
19:07
one of the key words in heaven is layers
19:10
there's layers of everything layers of
19:13
space
19:14
you can have like 10 places on your
19:16
space your one mansion's on
19:19
and it's hard to explain except when
19:20
they teach me how to say it
19:22
you can see it and so on your mansion
19:25
let's say you have a city
19:26
i've seen some people's mansions the
19:28
size of new york city so maybe you
19:30
better expand
19:31
your thinking say expand that
19:38
and on your management property there
19:39
are these doors suspended just above the
19:41
ground
19:42
a beautiful door different colors
19:44
different doors
19:45
like around your or your whole property
19:47
where your actual mansion is sitting on
19:49
whether it's in the middle of the
19:51
crystal sea under the crystal sea on top
19:53
of the mountain spices in the valley of
19:54
the falls
19:55
uh wherever it is that he puts it uh
19:58
on that property will be doors and if if
20:01
you
20:02
open the door you can see the other
20:04
space that yours
20:06
with places in there that are yours
20:09
you can walk around the door like i
20:11
could walk around this this is how
20:12
there's no limit to space in heaven
20:15
here's the door let's pretend this is
20:17
the door
20:18
you can walk around the door you see the
20:20
door right you see it
20:21
you can walk around it's just this but
20:24
if you open
20:25
the door you step into another whole
20:28
area that belongs to you
20:30
that could be in the valley of the falls
20:32
the mansion out here is maybe on the
20:34
beach of the crystal sea
20:35
or the mountain spices so you get many
20:38
he said
20:39
what do you say i go to repair a place
20:42
for you
20:44
in my father's house
20:48
a world not a flat place in the sky
20:54
are many mansions
20:57
i go there to prepare a place for you
21:02
so he's not going to tell you any more
21:03
than that
21:05
oh until you get there and then you find
21:09
out
21:10
really how magnificent and amazing he is
21:17
there's so many things adventure
21:19
excitement intensity
21:21
a joy humor all of that is in heaven
21:24
that's why we have it here say it was
21:28
there first
21:30
it trickled down to here
21:34
they have mountains they have valleys
21:36
they have oceans you can ride a 200 foot
21:38
wave and
21:38
not die when you crash off of your board
21:40
because you haven't done enough times up
21:42
there
21:44
the waves can change direction while
21:46
you're on them okay they can open
21:47
up they can swing you back and forth
21:52
is heaven
21:55
it says eyes have not seen your ear
21:57
heard or entered in the heart or mind of
21:58
man
21:59
but he has prepared for you except
22:02
and unless is revealed by the spirit of
22:05
god i stand
22:06
on that scripture for every time they've
22:08
taken me every time they've shown me i
22:10
can stand on
22:11
that because of that i can see
22:15
i can know and i can't understand
22:18
and that's my commission my commission
22:21
is to reveal heaven to this earth
22:23
that's why i go all the time non-stop
22:25
they have not stopped since
22:27
1996 taking me
22:30
i used to try to count gave that up
22:33
pretty soon
22:35
and guess what when does he do it
22:37
whenever he wants to
22:39
why i gave him permission you have my
22:42
permission to do with me whatever you
22:43
want if you ever said that you better
22:44
watch out
22:45
because these are the days of the
22:47
glorious signs and wonders that
22:49
manifested signs
22:51
with through the daughters and sons of
22:52
god on the earth
22:54
those aren't other beings who are going
22:56
to come here and have it
22:58
yes you say it's us
23:02
we're your sons and daughters
23:05
we'll manifest and demonstrate
23:12
[Applause]
23:18
hearing things and uh seeing things you
23:20
never saw before
23:22
and don't worry when he tells you you're
23:25
going to hear him
23:26
how does he do that uh step up and do
23:29
that
23:30
step out go up to the front of the
23:32
funeral and raise the dead that was
23:34
cremated
23:37
[Music]
23:38
[Applause]
23:48
that happened a few times maybe facebook
23:51
won't block it
23:55
that's probably going to be replaced
23:56
also by the way
23:59
yeah they'll just be replaced
24:03
and you know they didn't really do all
24:04
that until guess who started running for
24:06
office
24:08
because he's a threat
24:11
he said you can't be bought talk about
24:12
trump again i don't mind insane
24:14
it can't be bought can't be controlled
24:17
they can't make him afraid
24:18
and he already knows the truth
24:21
so they can't convince him to lie they
24:24
can't even deceive him
24:25
he knew all of them before this started
24:27
happening
24:29
because the wealthy and the rich are
24:30
invited to everybody's inner circle
24:32
whether the good or not they know
24:34
he knew the corruption that's why he was
24:36
willing to do it
24:38
we don't know what they're lying out of
24:40
their teeth i know what they're doing i
24:41
know all the stuff they're involved in
24:42
no hey
24:43
yes i will run
24:46
and they were afraid from the day he
24:48
said that they tried everything we could
24:50
of 17 people trying to get that spot on
24:52
the republican ticket
24:54
and god told me i will eliminate them
24:56
one by one
24:58
by one and they will be forced to put
25:00
him there
25:01
guess what happened they were forced to
25:03
put him there
25:06
amen
25:09
i know even even through history there's
25:11
always been people that nobody else
25:12
would have picked but god
25:16
and some of them were very colorful
25:20
yeah but if anybody ever heard all the
25:23
stuff that was said against him
25:24
they would think he wasn't worth
25:26
anything and yet right now he's very
25:27
valuable to god
25:29
if anybody likes it or not he will be
25:31
leading all this stuff that's going to
25:33
be happening
25:35
and while we've been out here some
25:36
people not maybe y'all
25:38
people are afraid not knowing what their
25:39
life is going to be like how's
25:41
everything what about all these horrible
25:42
things being made from the
25:44
villains laugh
25:49
that's what heaven is doing about it
25:55
there probably was never anything on the
25:56
papers just so you know that
25:59
they didn't waste the time to do it they
26:01
whatever they can get away with the food
26:03
people they're doing this is to say this
26:04
is truth
26:08
we just can't be deceived amen
26:11
and most of people i've talked to i
26:12
start to start a conversation
26:14
anywhere in the airport the grocery
26:16
store i don't care where it is so what
26:18
did you think about the elections
26:21
see i used to say
26:24
hey i voted for trump
26:30
90 of everyone i talked to by the way
26:32
you voted for trump yeah
26:34
they did and the ones that didn't don't
26:37
even know what the other ones are doing
26:38
up there right now i confronted one of
26:40
those the other day in my own yard
26:44
yeah my husband hired him to mow front
26:46
yard and came to the back he should have
26:47
never done that
26:49
i was about there i was back there
26:53
because
26:53
we released a home from friends of ours
26:55
who were pastors in new york so
26:57
uh the guy was replacing the little
26:59
fertilizer fertilizer see i can't even
27:01
think that what are they called where's
27:03
my husband
27:05
where are they putting the ground those
27:06
tubes to kill the bugs that come in to
27:08
eat your house up
27:09
terminator
27:12
see my natural brain don't ask me a
27:15
question
27:17
heaven spirit round future past you know
27:20
anything about
27:21
god father son holy spirit the 12
27:24
you know what are they the 12
27:28
the 24 elders know i know all of them
27:32
already
27:35
oh the seven spirits of god aren't just
27:37
his attributes
27:38
those are seven spiritual beings in case
27:40
you wonder
27:41
oh yeah they are actually seven smooth
27:44
the wednesdays so they're seven
27:46
spiritual beings
27:48
it's one of the images they use god
27:50
sends them on special assignments
27:54
i laugh when you hear cloak and dagger
27:55
that's usually about you know murder
27:57
mysteries but
27:58
actually holy spirit wears a club all
27:59
the time he loves to
28:01
he wears one the seven spirits of god
28:03
wear them that came from heaven that's
28:05
not a hell thing
28:07
hell stole too many things okay
28:10
say house deals because they can't
28:13
create something new
28:18
and so anyway so i was back there with a
28:20
guy replacing those termite tubes
28:22
and i said the same thing hey so uh he's
28:24
up say he's a millennial too
28:26
i said so what did you think about the
28:28
elections i think they were stolen
28:30
yes they were still on the
28:33
lousy themselves
28:36
they're all villains i want you to say
28:38
what god calls them
28:40
and then comes around the corner the
28:42
other guy
28:45
so what do you think about the elections
28:47
oh i think i am so glad they got someone
28:49
in there the other one was such a rotten
28:50
lousy guy
28:51
oh you're talking about fighting right
28:54
might as well say his name
28:55
yeah now i'm talking about something so
28:57
oh no no no no he is the good
28:59
guy do you know what the other ones are
29:02
doing
29:02
do you even know what they're doing well
29:04
i know they're doing good things for
29:05
this country but
29:07
you cannot watch one single thing that
29:09
they said they're doing
29:12
and you don't know that they want to let
29:15
all the terrorists in the world
29:16
here with no pulse bar
29:19
did you know they want to break down the
29:20
law so all those human trafficking
29:22
people can come through and just gather
29:23
more
29:24
to take out and and you obviously don't
29:27
know that they're going to wipe out
29:28
church completely because they don't
29:29
want god here
29:31
and this guy guy had already said to me
29:33
god bless you well
29:34
that's who you believe then you don't
29:36
need to know those people up there
29:39
because god's not blessing now he's
29:42
going to remove them
29:43
oh i don't think that let's just end
29:45
this really quick conversation
29:47
i would tell you they have all the
29:49
evidence if they had no no i'm not
29:50
talking about
29:51
civil civil evidence i'm talking about
29:53
military tribunal
29:55
evidence i'm talking videos i'm talking
29:58
testimonies i'm talking things that have
29:59
been taped that you would be so
30:00
horrified to find out what they actually
30:02
have been doing
30:03
even before they started their what they
30:05
knew who they connected to what they've
30:07
been doing all around this world
30:08
it's already there it's there and they
30:11
have it
30:12
these guys who are in there now faking
30:16
who they think they are they will be
30:17
wiped out and god will say exactly who
30:19
our president
30:20
is back there maybe not in that spot but
30:23
he's going to play back he will still
30:25
run this country he is president he
30:27
doesn't have to be proven to be
30:28
president he already has won
30:30
he won the other guy over here going yes
30:34
yay the termite guy
30:38
and this guy was probably in his late
30:40
40s and this young guy knew more than he
30:42
did
30:43
he was he was very aware of what was
30:45
going on you'd be surprised
30:47
if you talked to how many people voted
30:49
for the other guy
30:50
don't know anything that they're doing
30:53
because all they know
30:54
is they hate the other one
30:58
and that was their plan we will bring
31:00
this i'm serious
31:01
it's what they do in other countries
31:04
they brainwash people to believe what
31:05
they want to
31:06
then they go do whatever they feel like
31:09
that's how those people live that's how
31:11
people live in venezuela
31:12
and other countries they know what
31:15
socialism and communism is and they
31:17
don't want it this way they try to
31:18
escape
31:21
so they made a few announcements and the
31:23
whole rest of their campaign on the left
31:25
was
31:25
how horrible he is and if you ask him
31:29
why is he horrible well i don't know but
31:30
he's just
31:33
i can free you from that right now in
31:34
your soul do you wanna then they run
31:36
come over here i'll get rid of that of
31:38
your soul you need to get that out of
31:39
your shoulder you can live a normal life
31:41
again
31:44
and actually tomorrow's when i talk
31:45
about america
31:48
this is this commercial for tomorrow
31:52
amen because heaven
31:55
is celebrating everywhere right now
31:58
they're celebrating because they do know
32:00
what time it is on god's timeline
32:03
and if people don't know this is i'm
32:05
talking about pastors and i won't talk
32:06
about pastors revenge as well okay
32:08
evangelists kind of got it made because
32:10
they're still going for the big harvest
32:12
right now we're going to talk about the
32:14
naked harvest we're going on with the
32:16
big harvest that's what we're here for
32:17
what
32:17
no you should be a voice for truth no
32:19
matter what else you do you should say
32:21
the truth
32:22
let people know where you stand with
32:24
what god
32:25
wants what god asks of us let
32:28
life live let life live and don't take
32:32
it amen
32:34
and anyone who wants to take life you're
32:36
already in a really hard spot
32:38
but god if you voted for life to be
32:41
taken from babies
32:42
you are in trouble and i can honestly
32:45
say that according to the word of god
32:46
you're in trouble
32:48
you are and one day you'll be falling on
32:50
your face repenting when you find out
32:51
the truth of what the other ones were
32:53
doing continually amen
32:55
so i gotta let go let's let go and set
32:58
it back here
32:59
somewhere up here
33:03
because god is right now beginning to
33:05
create that habitation
33:06
and people need to know number one the
33:08
world's not ending
33:10
now i'm talking about heaven it's not
33:11
over say it's not over
33:14
i just the father says it's over
33:18
not even jesus knows when it's over
33:24
and i have new spheres not coming for a
33:26
church that is fighting each other angry
33:28
at each other
33:29
despising each other spitting on each
33:31
other shall i continue
33:34
coming for a church and a bride who has
33:38
no sin and no
33:41
flesh showing up in flesh and
33:44
fleshy fighting it is what the spiritual
33:48
mind is
33:49
life refreshing mind it is
33:54
he said i offer you life and death what
33:55
do you say to choose my life
33:57
a lot of people miss that this time
33:59
around
34:01
because life is what you're going to get
34:02
everybody's going to get life even the
34:04
ones who didn't want it it's going to
34:05
come it's not going to stop from coming
34:07
and he knows his timing he has a
34:09
timeline around his
34:11
behind his own throne his throne is in
34:13
the middle of the throne room
34:16
it's not on the back wall and you'd
34:18
always seen these paintings
34:20
there's god on his throne and there's
34:23
millions of people all over here who
34:25
can't get to him he didn't ever do that
34:28
it's in the middle when four sets of
34:30
steps
34:31
and people run up there all the time all
34:34
the time
34:35
if you make it to heaven you're going to
34:37
get to see god okay you get to see
34:39
father you get to see jesus
34:41
i never understood these people that
34:42
said there's levels you have to get you
34:43
after you get up there
34:44
no the bible doesn't say does that
34:47
no no it says the pure in
34:50
heart shall see god
34:54
amen and that means it can be now once
34:57
you get born again
34:58
or when you go to heaven people need to
35:01
get over that
35:02
no one can see the face of god and live
35:04
oh trust me
35:05
everything within you that was wrong
35:07
would die instantly if you saw him
35:10
but the bible clearly says the pure
35:12
heart shall see
35:14
god right so guess what i see him
35:20
i see him i see jesus christ i didn't
35:22
see the invisible spirit of god
35:24
i see the outline of his person usually
35:27
fires going around him
35:28
or whirlwinds of the rainbow or going
35:31
around him
35:32
but i see him he's big
35:37
and he is called the drama king in
35:38
heaven
35:42
well he sure creates drama every time he
35:45
touches the earth doesn't he
35:48
they were not suspecting him back in the
35:51
day when he fell
35:54
and began to do things that people were
35:56
spinning and jumping
35:58
over furniture and they really were
36:00
doing crazy wild things way back they
36:02
didn't even know what they didn't
36:03
really know what they had they just knew
36:05
it felt good
36:07
we should be well acquainted with it he
36:09
is my best friend and he speaks to me
36:12
all the time
36:13
guess what he's always speaking
36:17
always say always are you hearing him
36:22
you're hearing but maybe we need to
36:25
unclutter our soul
36:27
the more stuff you get in the layers you
36:29
are a later being holy spirit as
36:30
unlimited layers thank you holy spirit
36:32
for reminding me i was supposed to talk
36:33
about that
36:34
see i told you you don't smell the time
36:36
holy spirit is
36:38
very powerful being he's still with
36:40
celebration and joy
36:42
drama excitement that's him if there's
36:45
enough roar in heaven
36:46
holy spirit there then i get corrected
36:50
doctrinally i thought he moved to the
36:52
earth
36:54
why don't you have a conversation with
36:55
him i'll let you talk to him about that
36:57
and see what he says to you
36:58
okay he has unlimited layers of himself
37:01
so when he involves you you don't get a
37:03
little piece you get a hold of him
37:08
he takes a layer of himself and throws
37:11
it in you
37:13
that's how that happens unlimited
37:16
layers that's how he can be everywhere
37:19
all the same time
37:20
all over the world know everything see
37:23
everything
37:23
hear everything
37:27
you can invade any places he's invited
37:29
to somebody's not invited to
37:32
he's the most exciting single beings the
37:35
most excited
37:37
being in existence
37:40
right now right now i see jesus can't
37:43
come back right now
37:45
the father's up there delegating through
37:47
governmental stuff all the
37:49
stuff that's going on right now on earth
37:50
but the holy spirit
37:52
well he didn't move his operations here
37:55
that doctrinal person was right
37:57
he did jesus said when i leave i will
37:59
send who
38:00
the holy spirit the comforter the one
38:02
who will walk alongside hey walk
38:03
alongside
38:06
yeah unless you invite him in
38:09
if you ever wonder what spiritual
38:10
protocol is
38:13
even in heaven you must invite
38:16
okay you must invite i'll prove it you
38:19
invited jesus christ
38:20
right yes say yes he did we can take
38:23
care of that right now
38:24
[Music]
38:26
you must invite jesus christ
38:29
to be your savior repent of your sins
38:32
invite him to come in this is all
38:34
scriptural
38:36
john 3 16 he will come into you
38:39
he also has unlimited layers
38:42
and he made you with unlimited layers of
38:45
you
38:46
everyone in here has layers that look
38:49
just like you
38:51
is this exciting yeah it should be it's
38:54
the way you meet your soul
38:55
your soul your emotions are all your
38:57
layers the more emotional we are the
38:59
more
39:00
layers of you you have in you what does
39:01
it do with those layers well
39:03
when you get born again because you
39:05
invited him
39:07
right he takes one and he seats it in
39:10
heavenly places
39:12
and it's you it literally is it
39:14
literally really
39:15
truthfully is you it's a part of you it
39:18
looks just like you
39:21
still connected to your soul
39:24
so all around your will let's say this
39:26
is your will
39:28
it's a strong column off of that from
39:30
all these layers that look just like you
39:32
but they move like they're living
39:34
because they are this is a spiritual
39:36
part of you
39:37
not talking about your flesh your flesh
39:40
suit is your flesh seep okay
39:42
until it gets super glued together at
39:43
the end
39:47
that's glorified when you're glorified
39:51
that'll happen one day okay you don't
39:53
get glorified in heaven
39:54
you can glorify when your spirit person
39:58
who moves to heaven while your body
40:00
rests or if it's blown up or eaten by a
40:02
shark or
40:03
burnt up to nothing he knows where every
40:06
cell and molecule of you is this is true
40:08
because some people think
40:09
you can't get cremated say it's cheaper
40:12
say it's cheaper your family member was
40:16
standing right here said why didn't you
40:17
cremate me
40:19
you would have saved money and god will
40:22
still put everybody back together again
40:23
one
40:24
day because is he going to leave all the
40:25
people who were burnt out somewhere
40:28
no no you get your body back say yay
40:36
he's going to look a whole lot better
40:40
[Music]
40:42
your spiritual bodies didn't turn you
40:43
right now you go man i look good
40:47
because guess what everyone says in
40:48
heaven man you look good
40:52
you look funny you look good too
40:56
but they recognize you it says so in the
40:58
bible
40:59
it says you will be known that means
41:02
your images
41:03
you'll be known as you were known on the
41:05
earth so people will know you
41:07
everyone in heaven knows your first name
41:09
everyone's going to want a hug
41:10
say no masks in heaven
41:14
no social distancing in heaven
41:18
no handshakes in heaven
41:22
they give up hugs father abraham will
41:26
probably be the first one
41:29
if you make it to the gate because
41:32
sometimes your family members are
41:33
waiting outside
41:34
the gate when you come up to heaven
41:36
there's a landing place you come
41:38
no matter how they bring you in jesus's
41:40
own chariot
41:41
somebody's chariot a spaceship
41:44
a world war ii biplane whatever people
41:48
come in many different things whatever
41:49
would delight you the most is how you're
41:51
going to be taken some people step in
41:52
the elevator and they just go they don't
41:53
want to mess around
41:56
they're the people with few layers in
41:58
their soul okay
42:00
they got five layers just taken young
42:03
their angels stepped in this spiritual
42:05
elevator
42:06
they step in with the person and up they
42:08
go and they're there they bypass going
42:10
to see
42:10
the whole galaxies and everything which
42:12
he will take you to see if you want to
42:14
so even leaving is an experience is
42:17
a powerful experience
42:21
but you have layers in you and he made
42:23
you that way number one
42:24
spirit soul and body shall we count them
42:27
say spirits
42:28
that's a layer body that's a layer soul
42:32
that's a layer even your body
42:35
has layers right the skin the muscles
42:39
the bones you have layers there's no way
42:42
you can deny that
42:44
you have layers your spiritual layers
42:46
are some of the most exciting
42:49
so people who have a lot of emotions
42:51
down here
42:52
probably going to be magnified in heaven
42:54
your personality gets magnified in
42:56
heaven
42:58
yes the jokes are better okay
43:02
number one there's nothing defiling
43:05
nothing breaking nothing evil
43:06
nothing that anybody couldn't see the
43:09
movies are all clean
43:11
the jokes are clean stay clean
43:14
it's heaven
43:18
most exciting intense beautiful amazing
43:21
that would wonder
43:22
and splendor and creatures you've never
43:25
even seen before are there
43:27
but he made you layer for different
43:29
reasons okay
43:30
so when this layer that you're wearing
43:33
right now
43:34
sleeps or like i said it's melted down
43:36
or whatever happens to it's going to be
43:37
okay
43:38
god got it okay he's got that thing so
43:41
yeah make sure you get cremated it's
43:43
cheaper
43:45
i meant people said i'm on i want to
43:47
give my family member a funeral but
43:49
would have been seventy thousand dollars
43:50
of what i had to create it for seven
43:52
months they're probably happy you did
43:53
that
43:56
because guess what we're all going to be
43:58
back say we'll all be back
44:01
we get our bodies back they will be
44:04
young
44:05
they will be timeless timeless
44:09
there's no time in heaven everyone is
44:12
young
44:14
time doesn't go by okay
44:17
it comes from god time comes from the
44:21
father
44:22
he's in charge of time okay he does
44:25
things in heaven by
44:26
events say by events on god's timeline
44:31
it's whatever event is on there is
44:34
what's happening
44:36
there's an event right now it's not send
44:39
jesus to
44:40
get the people on the rapture rug that's
44:42
not what's on there
44:43
that's way way down way away
44:47
okay say beginning of time i could draw
44:50
a timeline
44:51
all the way down to here
44:53
[Music]
44:54
we still have all of this left at least
44:57
several hundred years maybe more
44:59
i might still be here amen y'all want to
45:03
be here during all that time
45:04
yes are you sure about that
45:07
no i am
45:11
i've not been given an option when i
45:13
said yes to do this
45:14
and my family knows they already know
45:16
i'll be here when they're gone their
45:17
kids are gone their grandkids are going
45:19
the great friends
45:19
i'll still be here i'll make them some
45:21
brownies
45:26
because he chose me for that and i said
45:28
yes
45:30
you know john could have still been here
45:33
say john
45:34
that beloved the one who jesus loved
45:38
will be very scriptural could have
45:40
remained
45:41
and be here right now if he chose that
45:46
god's not a respecter you just have to
45:49
say yes
45:50
and you have to be willing yes is nice
45:52
willing is better
45:54
willing and obedient is what he needs
45:56
okay
45:57
for people who have commissions like
46:00
that
46:00
and that's not even my gift my gift i
46:03
as you look at me i am a photographer
46:07
my passion that i'd rather do 24 hours a
46:10
day if i could would be photography
46:12
i create moments in time
46:16
that's how i look at it i don't just
46:17
take a picture there is no taking
46:19
picture
46:19
if you take pictures around me i will
46:20
correct you hold the camera up
46:23
get the light on it before you bring it
46:24
down if you stand there you're gonna
46:26
have a shadow and all those things are
46:28
outlined
46:29
when i travel and speak overseas people
46:31
always want to take pictures what's got
46:33
a picture of the castle
46:34
all their 15 friends are lined up you
46:36
see the top of the castle
46:38
if i can help you please if you all will
46:41
stand like this
46:42
leave a space for the castle then like
46:44
this you'll all be in it but you can see
46:46
the castle
46:48
because this is what you take a picture
46:49
of right now
46:53
so that's what i am i was sent from god
46:57
in my soul photographer when i go to
47:00
heaven
47:01
i'll have my own studio please come
47:03
it'll be for free which is a joke
47:05
because nothing
47:06
costs anything anyway
47:10
i will for sure have a studio because i
47:12
know whatever gift he made you
47:14
is what you would do in heaven is what
47:15
you love the most that's how heaven
47:18
uprights that's why there's so many
47:19
things to do in heaven does that make
47:20
sense to your head
47:24
well most people thought we would just
47:25
be worshipping you never stop
47:28
because when you see all the things he
47:29
made for you you will worship in the
47:31
middle of the street
47:32
anywhere everywhere you start shouting
47:34
praises to god
47:36
because he remembered all the things
47:37
that you love amen
47:40
there'll be pictures of some of your
47:41
family members in your mansion
47:43
and right now they take pictures that
47:45
you if you lost if they were burned up
47:47
in a fighter
47:48
they'll be in your mountain on the wall
47:52
it's one of the things he does i know i
47:54
saw somebody's mansion
47:56
and i saw siblings they have right now
47:59
and i saw other ones like probably maybe
48:01
i don't know 10 11 12 something like
48:03
that they weren't even born yet
48:04
and i know how many siblings this other
48:07
person
48:08
will have so people's mountains will be
48:11
quite a delight to you your crowning
48:13
room is
48:14
massive because you get more than one
48:16
crown
48:16
[Music]
48:18
he gives them out say he gives them out
48:22
at one time we will throw a specific one
48:26
we're not going to throw all of them at
48:27
him we bury him maybe i don't know
48:34
it's okay to laugh you need to know that
48:37
humor is one of the number one things in
48:39
heaven there is peace people go well
48:42
peace
48:42
be with them they die don't even rest in
48:44
the arms of jesus they're not resting
48:46
[Music]
48:47
they're riding a roller coaster
48:52
they're eating desserts somewhere
48:55
because jesus loves desserts
49:00
honey was his number one thing he ate
49:02
while he was on the earth
49:04
and guess what his cousin ate it too
49:06
right
49:07
what did johnny where's the last thing
49:11
say it loud his family was hooked on
49:14
honey
49:17
jesus loved honey we made that that
49:19
feast for them on the
49:20
shore fish and it was honey
49:25
he loves honey guess what he still loves
49:26
me i have a jar in my pantry that says
49:28
this is for jesus if he shows up
49:32
i'm ready
49:36
and to make this whole thing even
49:37
funnier people don't think they'll laugh
49:39
sometimes you laugh or cry when i talk
49:41
about it sometimes you just don't know
49:42
what to say because your
49:43
your natural brains like blanked out a
49:46
long time ago
49:49
it's going to be in the ground anyway or
49:51
where else it ever is
49:52
but but i was the person in the family
49:56
of 15 who wanted to number one be alone
50:00
in a family of 14 siblings i always
50:03
wanted to be alone was that ever going
50:04
to happen
50:06
do you think it was ever going to be
50:08
about me say no really loud
50:14
i wanted to be alone and i didn't care
50:15
if anybody knew who i was i don't know
50:17
if they knew my name i didn't want to
50:18
hug
50:18
anyone i didn't want to hug anybody that
50:21
won't be kissed
50:22
don't go to italy unless you want to be
50:24
kissed
50:26
if you go to a meeting 500 people you're
50:28
going to get a thousand kisses because
50:29
they don't just kiss you once they kiss
50:31
you on both cheeks
50:36
kiss kiss kiss kiss by these 400 people
50:39
they had four four meetings
50:42
they're making so much for my life so i
50:45
want to be alone right
50:47
i didn't want to be hugged or kissed i
50:50
didn't want anyone to know me
50:51
i knew two people and all of the schools
50:54
i attended all three of my schools i
50:56
knew two people that was it
50:58
i wasn't seeking for people i was never
51:01
part of a clique i was probably better
51:03
off
51:04
i wasn't a part of any of the crimes and
51:06
other stuff i never got into that stuff
51:08
because number one remember i could see
51:09
i saw the demons around it
51:12
you didn't have to ask me what hell was
51:13
involved in heaven was i could see it
51:16
so i didn't want any of that
51:19
so here i am just wanted to be left
51:21
alone that that wasn't going to happen
51:23
in my life
51:24
first of all i had to give myself to my
51:25
family i was always on my parents side
51:27
that made you
51:28
unpopular had 150 pets to take care of
51:34
the person we learned in the bible was
51:36
how to do a funeral
51:38
we sent every one of our pets to heaven
51:40
don't argue with me about that
51:43
i saw them there like every pet we ever
51:46
have is in heaven
51:48
my dad has him on his ranch every time
51:51
he's someone i hear
51:52
these words from my father in heaven he
51:55
gets another one
51:58
that was my dad's favorite words it was
52:00
whatever he said about anything
52:03
he he eat gas
52:08
he gave himself to the world he loved
52:09
his enemies literally
52:11
he loved his enemies it ticked him off
52:15
he loved everybody dragged him in our
52:16
house got him a bed on the floor
52:18
somewhere
52:19
fed them found them jobs got them
52:20
clothes helped them get a house
52:22
that was my dad's part in the world was
52:25
to be the love of god
52:26
my brother rj said he was meant to kill
52:29
wicked people
52:31
we only did one meeting if you never met
52:33
my brother rj you should search for
52:34
someone
52:35
yeah my brother despises injustice if he
52:39
ever was a warrior he's the warrior he
52:41
is the word
52:42
he lives out in the wilderness away from
52:43
everybody so he doesn't kill you know
52:45
half the harvest
52:46
before they get saved but he won't take
52:49
down people who call the police i found
52:50
the criminal you've been looking forward
52:51
such as
52:52
there he is already dad but they all
52:55
know him so you know he's not going to
52:57
hurt anyone that
52:58
that didn't deserve it that's what he
53:00
says our one meeting began together
53:02
he let me go first and i was just
53:04
talking about the love of god in heaven
53:06
and everything
53:07
then he gives her that high i'm rjs she
53:09
was uh she was
53:10
created by god she loved people i'm
53:12
created to kill him it's a wicked
53:16
this is the funny thing we were in a
53:17
block church because almost no white
53:19
pastors that time would invite me
53:20
i might tell you something
53:24
they weren't threatened by me
53:27
because you know their whole culture
53:28
they already had heaven culture right
53:30
yeah and i have a lot about 50 000 black
53:33
friends i love them all
53:34
right and they might guess what
53:36
righteousness truth they want all that
53:38
they do again the line drawing news
53:41
that's what god calls him the lion
53:42
crying news
53:44
but anyway so that's what he said i'm
53:46
created to kill people who would take
53:48
her out
53:48
or kill people who are wicked and evil
53:50
and belong to the devil he gets locked
53:52
on death row
53:53
he's about my height to minister to
53:56
people who are about to be
53:58
taken out yeah and he won't
54:01
not look down he will not look down most
54:03
people won't even go there's like three
54:04
levels of bars between you and the
54:06
people
54:06
he'll walk up to the closest bars he can
54:08
get to put his face right there and
54:09
stare a hole in him
54:11
and he move his eyes he'll just sit
54:13
there and then they'll go like this who
54:15
do you serve
54:17
i started the living god of heaven on
54:18
earth you made you
54:20
carried you before you he gave you
54:21
commission said he earth to bring life
54:23
to people not to hurt them
54:25
you need to know jesus christ because i
54:26
know what hell looks like too and you'll
54:28
burn forever and you won't like it
54:31
they don't know what to do with him
54:33
right he goes and gets all these
54:34
prisoners one to jesus christ
54:37
he won't back down he's certainly not
54:38
back now and i won't tell you what he
54:39
wants to do to those people in the
54:41
barbed wire in dc
54:45
so my siblings are very different from
54:47
each other i learned to love everybody
54:49
no matter where you're from
54:50
where you're at you know i can honestly
54:52
say i love you because god
54:54
in me loves you so our job here is to
54:58
love to share the truth right
55:01
you don't have to force people to get
55:02
saved you can't do that anyway it has to
55:04
be a decision in here right
55:06
and make a decision we just water it you
55:09
know and share and then water it
55:10
somebody else water then somebody
55:12
wins them to jesus christ holy spirit
55:15
draws them say holy spirit draws them
55:20
it would be much harder with that holy
55:22
spirit on the earth okay that's why he
55:24
was sent way back in jesus
55:25
time it wasn't easy to live that either
55:28
but easy to live in the beginning right
55:31
after jesus left
55:33
but it certainly is different now and
55:36
you were made
55:38
by god very specific when he sent you
55:43
he wrote words on the will on your will
55:46
wrote on your actual will sometimes i
55:48
can see him on people's will
55:50
because i'm a seer i see spiritual
55:52
things he wrote words of what he
55:55
wanted you to be what he created you to
55:57
be in the earth
55:58
that book she writes every day of your
56:00
life in you're in a book
56:02
that's there you get it when you go to
56:04
heaven this is what he intended for you
56:06
this is what he purposed for you but
56:08
sometimes the enemy got you off track
56:10
sometimes wicked people did things
56:12
he didn't intent and he he that was not
56:14
his purpose he created the earth so he
56:16
could take you
56:17
from him where you live and when
56:20
the time of conception comes holy spirit
56:22
takes your little spiritual being
56:24
and knits you together to that dot of
56:26
flesh
56:27
that's i knit you together in your
56:29
mother's womb
56:30
that's not putting your arms and legs
56:32
down this nobody on this earth can do
56:34
this spiritual thing nobody
56:36
can even know where your spiritual being
56:38
is
56:39
the spirit of life talked about the
56:41
bible was you
56:44
you wrote in and out on the rays of the
56:46
rainbow from the father they still do
56:47
send me i want to i want to love people
56:50
to send me i want to go to earth for you
56:51
they'll say that to the father all the
56:53
time
56:54
that's what you did you played in the
56:56
river of life inside him he jumped on
56:57
the stones and fired
56:58
a massive gemstones burning with his
57:02
passion
57:03
that's where everyone here came from
57:06
everyone who's on the earth
57:10
came from that place the father carries
57:13
you
57:14
in him in him we live we move we have
57:17
our being
57:18
the prophets and poets of the old have
57:20
spoken of these things
57:23
that means they will show that it
57:25
reveals them where they came from
57:28
everyone no matter what they believe or
57:31
where they're at right now in this world
57:33
came from him
57:37
he is our father we are his offspring
57:41
his heart is that you know him that you
57:44
love him that you receive his son
57:47
so you can be with him in heaven because
57:48
jesus is the way
57:50
back to the father
57:54
and when anyone dies and they are caught
57:56
up to heaven
57:57
jesus meets you he walks you up the
57:59
steps of the throne
58:00
and says to his father here i have
58:02
brought them home to you
58:05
is part of his reward for dying for us
58:09
he knows everything about you still
58:11
loves you
58:12
still wants you has purpose for your
58:16
life here
58:18
this is the thing about the babies this
58:19
is awesome every baby when every baby
58:22
was sent he wrote on their wills
58:24
and by the way he wrote whether they
58:25
were male or female
58:28
yeah some other group can't teach
58:30
anybody that i know they'd like to do
58:31
that too by the way
58:33
they wrote that on some piece of paper
58:35
somewhere
58:38
he wrote in here and when people try to
58:41
be
58:41
some other thing that they're not they
58:44
have great
58:45
conflict in their soul their soul fights
58:47
against them
58:48
because their soul already knows if
58:52
you're male or female let alone what
58:53
your body is saying to you
58:55
they know that's what they were meant to
58:56
be and i have talked to many
58:58
people who switched that and have
59:02
switched back and would all tell me the
59:03
same thing
59:04
i had conflict all the time in my soul
59:06
it would fight and say no that's not you
59:09
that is not you that's not how you were
59:10
made you're meant to be
59:12
i will tell you this there is going to
59:13
be in one of these of god
59:15
millions of homosexuals will get born
59:18
again like
59:19
like in a sudden a way
59:24
and if they had operations they get
59:26
their stuff put back on
59:27
yeah talk about a sign and a wonder
59:31
right here
59:35
he's going to do it
59:38
he's going to do that because he made us
59:41
very specifically
59:42
he made us detailed our personalities
59:46
are different your personality is still
59:47
different in heaven
59:48
you're just nicer if you weren't nice
59:50
down here
59:52
you laugh and control me and you won't
59:54
get to stop it either
59:56
this place isn't heaven they go just for
59:58
the laughter okay waves of it
60:00
come out of places and hit you and just
60:02
roll on the ground you never did that
60:04
get used to it
60:06
practice maybe then i saw a spot
60:11
i was one of those people that didn't
60:12
laugh i was so serious i was serious
60:14
serious with the capital s
60:16
i was serious i was serious
60:19
i wanted everything to be done right
60:20
that was me
60:22
you know when my mom knew she left me
60:23
the house would still be burning and not
60:25
be burnt down
60:26
that i'd know where everybody was and
60:28
they'd be okay they may not be happy
60:29
with me
60:31
but but that was my assignment to keep
60:33
everybody together and keep them safe
60:35
and i i made like 10 sandwiches every
60:38
day for their lunch and helped them with
60:39
homework at night
60:41
then if i was they were sick i've got to
60:42
pray for them and sit with them until
60:44
they were better and
60:45
this was my life this was my life like
60:47
young my life
60:49
and i didn't say no to my parents i
60:51
honored my mother and my father
60:54
i get to do this now i get to have pink
60:57
hair which was ordered by heaven okay
60:59
i get to eat cake i still have to watch
61:01
how much i eat
61:02
okay i celebrate all the time because i
61:05
already know
61:06
i know what my end is i also pretty much
61:08
know what your end is
61:10
and it's because i'm willing have been
61:12
taken back in the past and shown how
61:14
things happen so i can give revelation
61:16
taken forward in the future i've had
61:18
glimpses of the new earth
61:20
and all the other worlds around it
61:24
i've seen father son holy spirit seven
61:27
spirits of god
61:28
melchizedek who is the father's high
61:30
priest and always has been
61:32
he has always had flesh on him i'm going
61:34
to really mess with your mind now
61:36
now has always had flesh before god made
61:38
flesh
61:39
on people on the earth
61:42
he's really neat looking he serves the
61:45
father at the obedience of the father
61:47
he came to the earth became the king of
61:49
salem collected tithes from abraham
61:51
that's why he could see
61:52
him he's also the one who's oh head of
61:55
the tribe of angels that there's a whole
61:57
tribe of angels
61:59
that god put flesh on so you can send
62:02
them to the earth as watch your angels
62:04
not all of them fell everybody says oh
62:06
my god not all of them
62:07
some did some did not they have flush
62:12
that's why they can make offspring i
62:14
hope your answers are getting
62:15
given okay but melchizedek still serves
62:18
the father
62:19
that's his position personal high priest
62:22
to the living god
62:24
the seven spirits of god also serve god
62:27
they serve him
62:28
they are his that means they serve him
62:31
that doesn't mean that they're his seven
62:32
attributes everybody
62:34
every syllabus i've ever seen okay seven
62:36
spirits of god here's the syllabus and
62:37
in five minutes i can tell you what it
62:39
is
62:41
okay how to explain the trinity some
62:43
people can't they think we have a
62:44
three-headed god
62:45
no they have the ability to step inside
62:48
of each other
62:50
father you know son holy spirit
62:53
holy spirit steps in the father jesus
62:56
steps in the father here's the three in
62:58
one
62:59
and that's how he showed me helped up to
63:01
heaven said i'm going to show you the
63:02
three in one
63:03
and they all came i said here we are
63:04
father son holy spirit
63:06
in a couple minutes of time if there was
63:08
time
63:09
i understood what people have tried to
63:11
figure out for years
63:12
when he said jesus said father me and
63:15
you when you and me
63:16
he literally meant me inside you and you
63:19
inside me
63:20
and when they began to create before
63:22
there was anything there was heaven
63:25
the father's house there's nothing but
63:27
the spirits around
63:28
the father would step up where there's
63:30
nothing he would speak
63:32
physical realm jesus stepped out of him
63:35
he was called the word stepped out
63:36
and a drop of water in his hand he
63:39
stretched it into a canvas
63:41
and he wrapped it around just like this
63:44
a huge part of the spirit realm
63:46
and we created the physical round and
63:48
then he began to hang
63:50
the planets on there anything visible
63:53
he couldn't hang physical things on a
63:55
spiritual thing
63:58
that's why spirits can walk through this
64:00
physical wall because the original realm
64:02
supersedes this physical realm which is
64:04
temporal
64:06
that's how he did it and from that
64:08
moment they began to create everything
64:10
in the physical realm we created the
64:11
planets
64:12
they didn't make the sun in the moon yet
64:17
because the first earth when he made it
64:19
the first time was lit with his glory
64:24
millions of years between verse
64:27
one mercy millions
64:31
millions say millions
64:35
i hope that messes up your mind too you
64:37
know who doesn't mess it up it doesn't
64:39
mess up scientists
64:42
they ask the uh i'm not going to say
64:44
astrological
64:46
the astronomy people already have an
64:48
understanding
64:49
that this earth is well well over
64:52
millions and millions and millions and
64:53
millions of years
64:54
old those who dig in the dirt and find
64:55
the dinosaurs and the layers of the
64:57
earth
64:57
they already understand that man man
65:01
man has been here for a limited time but
65:04
the earth itself has been here for a
65:06
very very long time
65:08
so when there's darkness covering the
65:10
earth because of what happened before
65:11
that
65:12
right in the beginning means before
65:14
there was time
65:16
in the beginning was when the earth was
65:18
just a thought in god's head
65:20
when he made the earth
65:23
it was perfect it was beautiful there
65:24
was no sin in it
65:26
he said to watch your angels to watch
65:28
over all the creatures that were on the
65:29
earth the dinosaurs roamed the earth
65:32
there was a water vapor shield around
65:33
the whole earth that put mist on the
65:36
ears because it hadn't
65:37
rained there had been no storms yet on
65:39
the earth there was only one landmass
65:41
and all this ocean was around it how do
65:44
i know
65:45
he took me back in time and showed me
65:47
how he created the heavens and the earth
65:49
and when i explain this to an
65:50
evolutionist they want to know god
65:55
because they have answers to the
65:57
questions they've always had
65:58
what about that footprint they found by
66:00
the dinosaur that was a watcher angel
66:04
who had flesh on him so his footprint
66:06
was in the dirt
66:07
there's no crow magnum man there were
66:08
never there never was a chromatin a man
66:11
okay
66:12
god didn't make people that were half
66:13
ape and half person and put them on the
66:15
earth okay
66:16
we are we didn't come from monkeys say
66:18
we didn't come from monkeys
66:21
say we're made in the image of god
66:24
he's not a monkey
66:28
the angels laugh every time they hear us
66:30
every time they watch the slime pool
66:32
thing
66:32
every time they watch someone talk about
66:34
the big bang they laugh so hard they
66:36
would cry if they could
66:37
[Music]
66:39
because that takes a lot more faith to
66:41
believe
66:42
than god making us putting us here right
66:46
so having this involved very much in our
66:48
lives always has been involved
66:50
the angels are all over in here they all
66:53
your angels are here and most of mine
66:56
are outside because they couldn't fit in
66:58
here
67:02
and god gave me promises all kinds of
67:03
promises just said yes i'll do this for
67:05
you however long it takes i don't care
67:07
he said one day i'll open their eyes
67:09
everybody will see the angels one day
67:10
i'll take everybody to heaven
67:12
so everybody raise always do this raise
67:13
your hand up
67:15
say we're ready right now take us for a
67:19
trip
67:21
let's see if it happens not today
67:27
that may seem strange to some people but
67:29
one day it will be happening the closer
67:31
we get
67:32
towards the end and the end for people
67:35
might be
67:36
the rapture but i can tell you this
67:40
all the stuff in the bible is going to
67:41
happen it will all happen the
67:42
tribulation the perilous times
67:44
it's going to happen christening on the
67:46
third jerusalem is going to happen for
67:48
that thousand years
67:49
satan being taken off the earth during
67:50
the time is going to happen he'll be
67:52
back on the earth to tempt all the ones
67:55
who were born
67:56
people lived to be seven eight nine
67:57
hundred years old during that time
67:59
uh if you died at 100 that would be like
68:01
a child
68:03
say timelessness is coming to the earth
68:08
before them
68:12
yes it said that there would be a
68:14
generation of people
68:15
on the earth that would taste of the
68:17
powers of the age to come the
68:19
age to come after this age we're in
68:22
is the millennial age so he's not done
68:26
with this one yet it's not going to end
68:28
okay but there would be people living
68:31
in your time i'm saying over the next
68:34
couple hundred years
68:35
in this time who will be timeless will
68:37
begin not to age
68:39
who will travel to the spirit realm all
68:40
the time rather than the physical realm
68:43
who do amazing signs and wonders for him
68:45
that's why he needs
68:46
this time right now to clean a lot of
68:49
the evil off of the earth
68:51
he can't even send new inventions
68:53
there's inventions that haven't happened
68:55
yet that will actually make our life
68:57
so much easier and so different that he
69:00
won't put them here until the evil is
69:02
pushed back
69:04
say god is not willing to give those
69:07
inventions
69:09
to the wicked if you see his big picture
69:13
about all this is happening you will
69:14
understand
69:15
why all the evil is being exposed and
69:19
it's being exposed
69:20
all over the world why is this happening
69:23
say god's going to clean
69:26
that platform off collard
69:31
so we can step into the greater days of
69:35
glory
69:38
that's why if everything had happened is
69:41
normal
69:43
and there's all kinds of stuff going on
69:44
we didn't know if everything had
69:46
happened as normal on november 3rd
69:48
then a lot of that would never be found
69:50
out it wouldn't be known
69:52
the evil wickedness would still be there
69:54
hiding plotting and planning
69:56
and god isn't going to do some things
69:58
until a lot of them are taken off
70:02
who understands please raise your hand
70:05
if you were god and you had great things
70:06
to send to the earth
70:08
would you allow all that to remain
70:11
and you can see just in our country
70:13
alone how that has interfered
70:16
you can imagine saying no holds barred
70:18
for anybody easier than what you want to
70:21
it would be really hard to have any of
70:22
that happen right
70:25
so he does have a plan it is going to we
70:28
are having justice it will come
70:31
not just here but around the world and
70:33
there's be some people here you will see
70:35
no more see there'll be people here
70:38
say it wicked people
70:42
who will be here no more
70:45
that is his plan amen amen so you're
70:48
living in different days
70:49
this is all different our lives have had
70:51
to be different right
70:53
it's going to be worth it for what is
70:56
coming that no
70:57
man can stop or interfere with and your
71:00
family member is going to be running to
71:02
you to find out who jesus christ
71:04
is there's going to be a lot of
71:06
salvations happening
71:07
because people number one are going to
71:08
know there's a god
71:10
because only god could do all what's
71:13
going to be done
71:14
so on god's timeline we're right there
71:17
at one of his things right now on his
71:19
timeline
71:20
right now we're there so everybody here
71:23
is born because he needs you here he
71:25
wants you here okay
71:26
no one is a mistake no matter how
71:30
you got here or who he sent you to
71:34
he never purpose evil for you or
71:37
harm or tragedy so everybody's seeing
71:40
enough we're going to do oh we're going
71:41
to do a soul checkup
71:43
and i do it for the sake of those who
71:45
probably wouldn't ever do it
71:48
this is available to the body of christ
71:50
to be free of everything that's hindered
71:52
you hurt you
71:53
any tragedy anything that happened in
71:55
your life that you keep having memories
71:57
of
71:58
maybe even nightmares about you won't
71:59
have them no more
72:01
if you're involved in addictions and you
72:04
sincerely lose that addiction from your
72:06
soul he'll come down and pull out of you
72:08
amen and this is something the father
72:12
taught me himself
72:13
it's the first time i actually looked at
72:14
my clock and then he told me that i'm
72:16
going to teach you something and i
72:17
looked at my clock it's all the time
72:19
when i came back it was four hours later
72:23
my staff had been beating on my door my
72:25
daughter come over to see me
72:27
and i didn't answer anybody my body was
72:28
there i wasn't there
72:31
he took me and showed me how he made a
72:33
human soul why he mean it that way
72:36
how important it is to understand the
72:37
fullness of the peace of the kingdom
72:40
i'm telling you about the keys of the
72:42
kingdom that's what this is you call it
72:43
something else he calls it a soul
72:45
checkup
72:45
you should do it all the time i used to
72:49
teach it once and then that was nice
72:51
and i found out a few weeks later no
72:52
this is a lifestyle
72:55
if someone says something horrible
72:56
bashing hurting to you
72:58
you turn around loose those words from
73:00
your soul
73:01
and him will go and it will be to you
73:04
like they never happened
73:06
if you saw traumas if you had tragedies
73:09
if you
73:10
lose that tragedy from your soul he'll
73:12
come down and go shh
73:13
it'll be like it never happened to you
73:16
you can talk about it there's no hurt
73:19
there's no fear
73:20
there's no suffering no matter what it
73:22
was you don't have to have
73:24
that in you he doesn't want it in you
73:26
his explanation to me was
73:28
i don't have time for them to have six
73:29
weeks or six months or six years of
73:31
therapy
73:32
i don't have that kind of time i need
73:34
them free i need them free right now
73:36
that's why i'm going to teach you this
73:37
and if you're willing to learn it and
73:39
train them
73:40
then i will show you who melchizedek is
73:43
you give me promises i'll do this for
73:45
you and i didn't ask him
73:46
i'll do this for you do this video i'll
73:48
do this for you and of course you know i
73:50
said yes
73:52
i know you'd be the whole world i'd be
73:53
training that's okay
73:56
it's the most important thing you
73:57
probably learn other than knowing jesus
73:59
christ you can walk through your life
74:01
with no pain no suffering no fear
74:04
no grief no traumas
74:07
no addictions now it may try to come
74:10
back to you saying nope
74:12
i got rid of you i'm not taking you back
74:14
and the devil will try to bring back
74:16
whatever he can you say nope it's gone
74:19
and i've done this with too many people
74:20
for you to try to tell me
74:22
it doesn't work it does work
74:26
so if you're a born-again believer you
74:28
can do this
74:29
okay so first i always start with we're
74:31
all going to repent and say father
74:33
father i come before your throne i come
74:35
before you
74:37
i love your son jesus christ i love you
74:40
right now i'm going to clean up my salt
74:42
right now i'm going to clean it up
74:44
i repent of any sin
74:47
since my original repentance
74:50
i don't want any of it in me so i'm
74:53
giving it back to your son
74:56
i thank you jesus thank you jesus for
74:59
cleansing my soul for blessing
75:01
my soul that i can be free of all sin
75:05
amen amen now we're going to do this
75:08
soul checkup
75:09
i will list things that you need to lose
75:11
from your soul but if i don't say
75:13
something you can say that yourself
75:15
and everyone does it so nobody's going
75:17
to be figured out
75:18
or pointed out the one thing i will see
75:20
is stuff leaving you
75:22
i'ma the seer i will see jesus come down
75:24
he pulls gray matter out of you
75:27
that's what it looks like it looks like
75:28
gray because you have the light of god
75:31
but if you have darkness in there if you
75:32
play with sin or play with stuff
75:35
and the enemy looks in you he will see
75:37
gray he will go after you
75:40
he'll already go after you so that's why
75:42
number one you don't want to keep it
75:43
right
75:44
he also doesn't want people bashing
75:46
screaming
75:47
yelling because you sound like hell when
75:50
you do that
75:52
our words are supposed to bring life
75:55
yes amen we're here to bring light and
75:58
love
75:59
and life those three things that's why
76:01
you're here
76:02
so if you have anger issues there's
76:04
something in your soul
76:06
that keeps making you do that so you can
76:08
lose anger from your soul it won't ever
76:10
come back again
76:12
don't go watch 10 movies with profanity
76:15
in them
76:16
i have to say this about profanity that
76:18
is hell's language
76:20
you are literally speaking the language
76:22
of hell
76:23
if they hear enough they're going to
76:25
start showing up
76:27
because they recognize those words
76:30
that's why god says no profane word
76:33
should come out of your mouth there it
76:35
is right there
76:35
no profane words should be spoken by you
76:38
amen
76:39
it's not in heaven no one in heaven
76:42
talks like that
76:43
i've been to hell three times and it was
76:45
filled that's the only language they
76:46
speak
76:48
so we don't want to represent now we're
76:50
not here for that right
76:52
and i'm sure you may have good reasons
76:54
to get angry
76:55
or upset it says you can be angry and
76:57
sin not okay
76:59
don't add that to your list we're not
77:02
supposed to wound people with our words
77:04
so please don't bash
77:05
people when people they say this when
77:08
people lash out at you
77:10
they're afraid fear
77:13
causes people to lash out they'll never
77:15
admit that
77:17
they won't even think that but fear
77:19
makes you lash out
77:21
that's what happens and i always know
77:23
that person needs help
77:24
if they're bashing me they need help and
77:27
so that's how i look and that's how god
77:29
has taught me to look at it so
77:32
we should always be here to help people
77:34
if people don't like you or they're mean
77:36
to you
77:36
please forgive them go in a room forgive
77:38
them loose all of it out of your soul
77:40
whatever it is maybe teach little kids
77:42
do this
77:43
even little kids if they're if they're
77:45
bashed at school or bullied at school
77:47
you as their parent can lay your hand on
77:49
their head and say as a watcher over
77:51
their soul
77:52
i choose to loose from my child's soul
77:54
all the hateful mean
77:55
ugly words that were spoken to him today
77:58
i loose them in jesus name and jesus
78:00
will come down and pull them out of the
78:02
soul of the child and those children
78:04
will act like it never happened
78:07
you have the right to do that because
78:08
you're the parent amen
78:10
so this is something you can live do for
78:12
the rest of your life
78:14
when something happens immediately to
78:16
you that's the best time to do it
78:17
if you're in grief i understand you miss
78:19
somebody but don't let that grief still
78:21
be there a year two years three years
78:22
five years
78:23
like don't build like a memorial it's
78:26
okay to put the pictures on the wall
78:27
i'm saying don't go in there and reap
78:29
over them all the time
78:30
they're in heaven saying please have a
78:32
life
78:34
they're up there saying please laugh
78:36
please let it go please release me
78:38
some people if your parents or loved
78:41
ones have died and you're still grieving
78:42
you need to say these words i choose
78:44
with my will to release my loved one
78:46
into the hands of jesus to complete
78:48
whatever destiny he has for them in
78:49
heaven
78:50
when you do that they will hear that in
78:52
heaven number one it will make them very
78:54
happy
78:55
it will remove grief out of you that
78:57
didn't leave yet
78:59
okay you don't want a spirit of grief
79:01
which doesn't go in here but will speak
79:03
to you all the time
79:04
about how horrible it was that they died
79:06
they repeat how they die
79:08
they don't think about how they died
79:10
they just know one thing
79:11
they're happy they're there and people
79:14
got saved in the last minute are really
79:16
happy they're there
79:18

what's going around you

but when those things aren't in you it's
86:23
much easier
86:24
but if you want the fullness of god
86:27
you can ask for more than just your rent
86:30
being paid
86:31
food on your table you know things that
86:33
need to be fixed or hold us fine
86:35
but he wants you to be more than that

you
86:38
have not because you asked not
86:41
today we're going to ask to have things
86:44
bound to our soul
86:46
when you do that he comes and he puts
86:48
them in you
86:49
some of them come in waves i see whole
86:52
waves
86:53
of the joy of the lord whole waves of
86:55

the life of god the light of god the
87:16
presence of the lord
87:19

89:05

89:11
be in jesus name so be it
89:15
[Applause]
89:22
amen
89:40
[Music]
89:43
he has great plans for all of us
89:46
and it doesn't depend on your age your
89:49
position
89:50
doesn't depend on anything but one thing
89:53
you belong to his son
89:55
right do you mean that decision to
89:57
accept christ and his sacrifice
90:00
i know a lot about things that happened
90:03
the day
90:04
that he died on the cross a lot about
90:07
what happened
90:08
from the moment his he had his spirit
90:10
leave his body
90:12
i think if he hadn't told him to leave
90:14
he might still be there
90:16
because he did he commanded the spirit
90:18
mentally leave his body
90:20
and his body was taken down it was
90:21
placed in the tomb
90:24
god appointed two angels to be with
90:26
christ
90:27
through many different times in his life
90:29
if it said angels came and comforted him
90:31
it was the same two angels
90:33
that they were always with and they were
90:34
with him in the garden they were chosen
90:36
to bring that cup that cup is a real cup
90:41
the thing he drank all the wickedness
90:43
and evil and every sin and wickedness
90:45
that existed he drank that that's what
90:48
had to be nailed to the cross it wasn't
90:49
just his physical body
90:51
it's what he carried to the cross
90:54
if people ask you how come jesus is the
90:56
only one who can forgive sins you tell
90:58
them that
90:59
he's the only one to drink all of the
91:02
evil of
91:03
every single sin into his being
91:07
and was willing to nail back to the
91:09
cross
91:10
and at that time he can abolish sin
91:13
in our lives when we repent is the only
91:16
one who's done that
91:17
he's the only one who's made that
91:18
sacrifice willing so he is the only one
91:21
that has the power to forgive sin
91:23
and he is the only way back to heaven
91:27
someone else has another heaven good
91:29
luck
91:30
the one i saw belonged to the god of the
91:33
bible
91:34
his son jesus christ holy spirit so many
91:37
angels
91:38
millions upon millions upon millions
91:40
upon millions upon millions upon
91:42
millions of angels
91:43
i've seen in heaven around in heaven all
91:45
over the earth
91:47
they belong to him amen
91:50
he made them for specific purposes
91:52
they're made in tribes
91:53
like there's tribes of watcher angels
91:55
tribes of couriers trying
91:57
of scribes and then there is the army of
91:59
heaven
92:01
that is a whole different creature
92:06
when it talks about the living creatures
92:08
before the throne of god you're pretty
92:09
much describing
92:10
most of the army of heaven they don't
92:13
look normal
92:14
they don't look like human eye and they
92:17
have wings whether you ever see them or
92:18
not
92:19
some are made out of just force i can't
92:22
even explain that they
92:23
they don't have any kind of shape that
92:25
you can identify
92:26
some have eyes some have 30 eyes some
92:29
have eyes all over their body some have
92:30
eyes in the front in the back
92:32
some have two heads front and front
92:36
i'm not going to explain that hello
92:41
hello
92:46
i was present when they brought
92:50
a gift to my grandson when he was born
92:52
and he is a carrier of the love of god
92:56
and he's going to be an athlete who will
92:58
win olympics
92:59
and he's focused he's got two things in
93:01
his life he's so focused i can't figure
93:03
his brain out
93:04
he can run faster than his father or
93:06
anybody who's ever tried
93:08
to beat him but what he will talk to you
93:10
about
93:11
is the love of god he was assigned these
93:15
two angels who were one being and their
93:17
names are passion
93:18
and compassion and they're with him all
93:21
the time
93:23
he has other angels who are with him uh
93:25
his main angel's name
93:26
is flash
93:30
your number one angel assigned to you is
93:32
because of the gift
93:34
you have mine is about 40 foot tall i've
93:37
never seen him
93:38
when i was a little tiny thing i could
93:39
see him following me around all the time
93:42
i apologize to him all the time
93:44
you probably shouldn't have heard me say
93:46
that i'm sorry
93:49
then he grins at me sometimes he rolls
93:51
his eyes at me but not often
93:54
he's there to protect me to watch over
93:56
me
93:57
sometimes he'll bring me things from
93:58
heaven and but
94:00
but this grandson's angels always uh oh
94:04
i know all my brain kids angels actually
94:06
speak to them hi thank you for watching
94:08
over them
94:09
you know they're going to be going here
94:11
i know you know that but
94:12
just pay attention
94:15
and and so yeah the one who's fast is
94:18
almost the speed of light
94:20
the first one is the first friends and
94:22
is very creative he started making trips
94:24
to him when he was three
94:26
he seen my dad talk to my dad described
94:28
my dad he never met my dad on the earth
94:30
my dad keeps giving his favorite candies
94:33
candies were around in the 50s that they
94:36
don't even have anymore
94:38
he's gone inside of a volcano in heaven
94:40
and rode the lava hound
94:42
with my dad he described
94:45
cars that could drive up the side of
94:46
mountains without wheels
94:48
they exist in heaven i never told him
94:50
about that
94:51
he's been making trips now for five
94:53
years
94:55
and he'll just say the most surprising
94:57
things come out of his mouth
94:58
nobody's saying anything he could lead a
95:01
service baptized so get people saved
95:03
baptized in water
95:04
cast demons out they have never been a
95:06
trim in the public school that was
95:07
probably a good thing
95:08
you'd be down the principal's office all
95:10
the time
95:12
your son just baptized someone in the
95:13
water fountain again
95:17
and he would yeah and the second one is
95:20
over the love of god will pray for
95:21
everybody
95:22
if he sees anyone limp in the store
95:24
anyway he'll run up to them in jesus
95:26
name
95:26
be healed
95:30
and the third one is a girl
95:35
and she would be she will dance and sing
95:38
and there will be weapons she'll be very
95:40
fierce they should
95:41
named her middle name fierce and i got
95:44
two pages on her before she was born
95:46
one whole one and a half pages of how
95:48
fierce it she'll be
95:50
she is fierce she runs for brothers
95:56
she totally understands things from god
95:59
she's for
96:00
sees things here's things her passion to
96:03
worship
96:04
surpasses everything else she's got
96:05
she's all about worship
96:07
singing and dancing and now she's
96:09
wanting to learn to play the violin i'm
96:10
sure that will be very
96:12
dangerous to hell when she does that
96:13
because what you do in worship is
96:15
dangerous against hell
96:18
your prayers are your worship is however
96:20
you do that by
96:23
that's painting danger to how when you
96:25
sing
96:26
dance if you flag whatever it is that
96:29
you do is worship
96:30
you create images that are captured and
96:32
taken before the throne of god
96:35
so she's fierce her angel that protects
96:38
her is the size of a mountain
96:40
his name is rock and he's got this
96:43
little tiny
96:44
person that he follows around you know i
96:47
every time i visit wherever they're all
96:48
at i thank them all the time for
96:50
watching over them
96:52
and so i know their names i know what
96:55
they will be
96:56
one of my rewards god loves children
97:00
she needs children you are not just
97:04
raising a child
97:05
you are shaping souls to the kingdom
97:08
and i talk more about the kingdom
97:10
usually than i do the actual world
97:13
that's why christ came he came to tell
97:16
us about the gospel of the kingdom
97:18
it wasn't just about dying that's just
97:21
how everything begins with you
97:23
ruling and reigning in the spirit realm
97:25
is what he actually has
97:27
for you you rule with him because he
97:30
rules
97:31
we have ultimate authority in this earth
97:34
over this earth over anything in this
97:37
earth
97:38
everything of satan has been put under
97:41
our feet
97:42
we have power over all say all
97:46
the power of the enemy we're going to
97:49
learn how to use it
97:53
we are he's starting something new brand
97:56
new
97:57
right in the middle of all this time
97:59
actually gave all the revelation about
98:01
it on the day of the fake
98:03
inauguration
98:06
it will happen the body will learn who
98:09
they are
98:10
what your authorities in the spirit
98:11
realm how to use that authority
98:13
how to crush darkness push it back it'll
98:15
be a different life to live in this
98:17
world
98:18
amen demons will run from you they won't
98:21
try to attack you they will try to get
98:23
away from you
98:24
because what you carry will cause great
98:27
pain to them yes
98:28
the light and the glory of god is
98:30
painful to the enemy
98:32
that's why when it showed up in hell on
98:34
the third day they were screaming
98:36
their faces were melting they couldn't
98:38
get away from christ fast enough
98:41
that is what it's going to be like to
98:43
live in this world with you
98:46
so you're not unimportant you're not
98:48
just a person you're not an old sinner
98:50
say by grace don't ever say that again
98:53
you are considered royalty in heaven
98:55
your manifested sons and daughters of
98:58
the most high god you are the love
99:02
of jesus christ life he gave
99:05
everything for you that's how much he
99:06
loves you
99:09
holy spirit can't wait to get to know
99:11
you better
99:13
he will share things with you that will
99:14
probably undo your natural mind
99:18
because heaven is not this world
99:21
it's only a shadow earth is a shadow of
99:24
what is in heaven
99:26
and what he has waiting for all of us
99:28
now in this life
99:29
probably won't be repeated again
99:32
what he starts now will continue until
99:35
the end of this age
99:37
and even those christians who would
99:39
become christians during the tribulation
99:41
will be a thorn in the flesh of satan
99:44
they won't be crying they won't be
99:46
hiding when it comes time
99:49
it's going to be executed i've already
99:50
been shown that they will be dancing in
99:52
the line
99:54
which would be the biggest irritation to
99:56
say who finding things
99:57
i'm really going to get them now they'll
100:00
already know they already had trips to
100:02
heaven by that time a lot of people will
100:03
be
100:04
uh it will be normal for people to be
100:06
caught up to have many times
100:07
doing greatest some of the greatest
100:09
things on the earth until things begin
100:11
to switch
100:11
okay i cannot tell you for sure
100:14
that the body will not be on this earth
100:16
when that happens but i will just repeat
100:18
what the word says
100:19
until he that is with hell is removed
100:22
the antichrist cannot appear on the
100:24
earth well i can tell you what if we
100:27
were all here
100:27
he would be able to do nothing he is not
100:31
here anywhere in the earth right now god
100:34
wouldn't be starting these greater days
100:36
of glory with so much
100:37
power of god being seen and felt and
100:39
known in the earth
100:41
satan would not be able to fulfill his
100:43
thing
100:44
his few years his bump in the road
100:47
that's what god says he gets a bump in
100:48
the road
100:50
he won't be able to operate that operate
100:52
like that in those days people will be
100:53
looking for a savior someone who can
100:56
rescue them from the horrific perils
100:58
times
100:58
which will also be a short time they
101:00
will take anybody
101:03
okay so who shows up is the antichrist
101:06
and he's actually going to be good for
101:07
the first three and a half years to fool
101:09
everybody
101:09
he only does all the evil stuff the last
101:11
three and a half years
101:13
and he still won't get the whole world i
101:15
don't know why people think he will
101:17
he won't there's going to be rednecks
101:20
here
101:20
that will not want him that will not
101:24
take satan
101:24
even during the tribulation and there
101:28
will be people
101:28
on the earth when christ comes to sit on
101:30
the thorn in jerusalem that didn't die
101:32
even during that time
101:34
and they will have a long time to make
101:37
their decision for christ you
101:39
have still have to get saved even during
101:41
the time when christ is on the throne
101:43
and some of those kings how about this
101:46
want one in there
101:47
knowing he's the son of god knowing he
101:49
will actually control the weather and
101:51
all these other things he will sit as
101:52
king of the world
101:54
and they will want in there so the satan
101:57
is loosed
101:57
1 000 years later out of the pit he will
102:00
have no authority or
102:01
power in the earth for that 1000 years
102:04
christ will have holy
102:05
ruling in the earth there will be people
102:07
who survive the tribulation that will
102:09
live
102:10
here during that time so
102:13
sometimes you'll understand things
102:14
sometimes you had a big picture given to
102:16
you right now
102:17
we still have a long way to go but at
102:20
this point
102:21
in history in heaven and on the earth
102:24
are the
102:24
greater days it's not the darker days
102:27
amen
102:29
i know some pastors if they don't have
102:31
revelation and they don't know what's
102:32
going on they always go to the end
102:35
this is the tribulation everybody get
102:37
ready for all this to happen
102:38
it's not going to happen evil is not
102:40
taking over this world right now it's
102:42
actually going to be diminished for a
102:44
very long time

02:50
just may be healed it happens in the
02:53
glory here all the time we have so many
02:55
angels here on assignment and I just I
02:58
just got a feeling some of New York and
03:00
just going to get healed you know a lot
03:02
of times it happens during worship
03:03
happens during the word and so we
03:07
definitely haven't opened heaven and
03:08
this is a place where miracles happen
03:10
so when you feel the presence of the
03:12
Lord we like to say it like this just
03:14
reach out reach out and touch him and
03:17
receive your miracle tonight all right
03:23
it's been excited we were living in
03:27
supernatural times and this has been a
03:29
supernatural week I'm sure every
03:31
here knows that Paul Kane went to be
03:34
with the Lord last Tuesday evening and
03:36
today was the afternoon when his body
03:39
was laid to rest in Santa Maria and just
03:43
different the signs and wonders
03:44
happening throughout the week and and so
03:47
I know that we're in the midst but we're
03:50
always in the midst of the supernatural
03:51
but it just seems like something special
03:53
and so we invited Kat a while ago and of
03:56
course nobody but God knew that Paul was
03:59
gonna go home and actually be buried on
04:01
the first day when she's speaking and I
04:03
know that it's not a coincidence I don't
04:05
know exactly what it means maybe she
04:07
does but I know stuff like that is not
04:10
just a coincidence so we're really
04:12
blessed and honored Kat to have you here
04:15
again and I'm sure how many of you have
04:17
never been in a live cat care meeting Oh
04:20
a lot of you good you're in for a treat
04:22
so why don't you can make your way up
04:25
Kat you need to come up around this way
04:26
and yeah you ready oh and while she's
04:32
coming up somebody dropped their glasses
04:34
so if that's you you probably can't see
04:36
but here they are when I put them up
04:42
here so Kat
04:43
um well brought those in you don't know
04:46
the Lord's been taking her to heaven for
04:48
several years and showing her things and
04:50
bringing her back and allowing her to
04:51
share with us so let's just welcome cat
04:54
Kirk
04:54
[Applause]
05:00
Wow
05:02
[Applause]
05:06
I know some people know why I'm saying
05:12
that some may not when the army of
05:16
heaven goes to battle against the
05:18
darkness that is their war cry why
05:25
because they're excited you're gonna
05:28
crush the enemy's plans over you right
05:30
they're gonna crush them they're gonna
05:33
pull down strongholds that have been
05:35
rising against you that's why they were
05:38
created news flash from heaven they
05:41
weren't created to protect heaven they
05:45
were made by the creator of heaven they
05:48
didn't get to kick Lucifer and one-third
05:51
of the angels out then you get to do
05:52
that
05:53
Michael hell them and the Father sent a
05:56
lightning bolt a million megawatts of
05:58
love from himself and took him out and
06:01
then one third of angels went out the
06:04
same way so they've been waiting a long
06:07
time to war on our behalf full time amen
06:13
I may or may not give you scripture for
06:16
that tonight go look it up I think most
06:20
of us know that Jesus was the lord of
06:24
state loud the host is the name of the
06:30
army of heaven yes they're still part of
06:32
the angel tribes but they're different
06:35
in many ways the ones under Gabriel have
06:40
many different positions and jobs in
06:43
heaven and on the earth and they look
06:46
more like us
06:47
they're the ones who look more like us
06:48
the army of heaven mostly does not look
06:51
anything like us they're creatures most
06:53
of them are creatures they're fierce
06:55
looking they're not gonna be pretty boys
06:57
with harps so what the Holy Spirit says
07:02
they're not gonna be pretty boys with
07:04
harps however there was one time when
07:08
they had to take the place of the
07:10
worship angels which were the one-third
07:12
that were kicked out the only ones
07:15
Lucifer got were the ones he was over he
07:17
was over one-third of the angels
07:18
was the worship angels obviously if he
07:22
was the one who led them in worship all
07:24
the time in heaven I'm just gonna give
07:27
you full out Revelation because I want
07:29
to take advantage of all the time I have
07:31
so if you didn't know this he used to
07:33
step inside God to lead worship he
07:36
covered over the very heart of God with
07:38
his wings which were embellished with
07:40
gems he had gems on his back on his
07:43
front people go well he had just a few
07:45
no he had really hundreds of them on him
07:48
and when God made him he made mountings
07:51
like in a ring and every gem was mounted
07:54
and amounting like a ring that you would
07:56
wear like this one here and he was
07:58
beautiful which is one of the reasons
08:00
why he ended up by falling from pride
08:02
from his beauty also he thought he was
08:05
smarter than God and that was a that was
08:08
busted mythbuster it's okay to laugh cuz
08:18
you're gonna laugh a lot tonight
08:19
alright heaven laughs every time the
08:23
devil loses down here all of heaven
08:25
roars yes they know what's going on and
08:29
today they were attendants for Paul Cain
08:33
with Paul Cain not talking about the
08:37
body talk about his spirit man everyone
08:42
gets to see their own homecoming isn't
08:44
that nice
08:45
so we're colors and play lots of music
08:48
and dance because that's what they'll be
08:51
doing in heaven news flash from heaven
08:54
number two they don't have a funeral in
08:56
heaven when you come home say Amen you
09:01
shouldn't expect one we should have a
09:04
party zone down here when we send people
09:07
off instead of a funeral home someone
09:09
opened a party zone I promise you'll
09:11
make more money than other people with
09:12
funeral homes cuz even the world will
09:14
want to send theirs off wherever they
09:15
think they're going they'll pick a party
09:19
anybody say Amen so that is a witty idea
09:24
I've been giving up for years I don't
09:25
think anybody's done it yet so there you
09:27
go the more real heaven becomes to the
09:32
body of
09:33
people will want to send them off with a
09:35
real celebration because of the reality
09:40
of what heaven is and what they're going
09:41
to be experiencing there it won't make
09:43
sense to have a sad funeral while
09:47
they're watching from the party I'm a
09:51
seer that means I see in the unseen
09:57
realm okay mister
10:01
I'm really happy Danny because I got to
10:04
experience all that heaven was doing and
10:06
what was going on with Paul Kane and his
10:09
mother and his sisters you know his
10:11
family that's up there and the others
10:14
who were attending up there watching his
10:16
service he enjoyed every funny thing
10:19
that was told he likes to be real so he
10:22
liked all the reality of who he was he
10:24
liked that personal side of him being
10:27
talked about so next time you plan a
10:30
family members homegoing service tell
10:33
some jokes because they will laugh I was
10:39
at a service one time and back home and
10:42
it was um trying to member the guys name
10:45
I remember told McClellan he was part of
10:47
story side B and he died suddenly and I
10:52
came into his service I didn't know
10:54
anyone but I was coming to bring some
10:56
books about heaven to his family the
10:57
Holy Spirit told me to and I saw him
11:00
watching from the portal that was really
11:03
difficult you know to try to pretend to
11:06
be sad and I never wear black it's okay
11:12
if you if you go to somewhere where
11:13
they're expecting you know to do what is
11:15
proper not to upset them but no one's
11:19
wearing black in heaven they're not and
11:22
they aren't having to partying there was
11:25
I saw Ron McClellan thank you my best
11:27
friend Holy Spirit he makes up for what
11:30
I don't know you know helps my human
11:34
head lots of times
11:35
because they kind of took that away from
11:37
me I used to be kind of brilliant
11:40
really then they made me like eight
11:42
years old
11:43
life is much easier being that way you
11:46
know what you don't worry about things
11:48
you don't think about what's gonna
11:49
happen five years down the road when you
11:51
don't even know or you already planned
11:54
you know prepare for disasters or
11:55
something I never got that really if
11:58
we're over the weather then we shouldn't
11:59
be concerned about the weather we rule
12:02
over it amen
12:03
okay she didn't know news bulletins
12:06
number three writes number three are you
12:07
keeping track you're gonna get a gift
12:11
number three
12:13
Jesus was over the weather we are joint
12:18
ears we get to be over the weather and
12:20
that great you're gonna see that more
12:23
and more I'm serious you're gonna see it
12:25
more and more things stop like stop
12:27
can't wait for that to happen
12:30
meteorologists might have to get another
12:32
job not making fake news by the way
12:37
they don't work now and it's not gonna
12:39
work when it's not actually happening
12:41
what was I talking about
12:46
number three boys over over the weather
12:52
Jesus was over the weather and he tried
12:54
so hard to teach his disciples he really
12:56
was in case you didn't know they were in
12:58
boot camp with him for three years it
13:01
wasn't just watch what I do
13:03
it's learn what I do and then do it
13:06
right he was gonna go he's gonna go back
13:09
for some R&R and he had to make sure
13:13
they understood how this whole thing
13:14
works being a joint heir with Christ
13:17
what do you have we have he said so
13:19
himself the things I did how point-blank
13:22
can you get the things and the works I
13:25
have done you will do well you forgot
13:30
the first part you will do also okay
13:34
these are just the works you got to do
13:36
the works say we got to do the works
13:40
then we get to do the greater say it
13:44
louder okay like you're excited well I
13:50
don't just try things I actually do them
13:54
there's a difference I'm just gonna try
13:57
that means you're not making much of a
13:59
plan about that right but doing it the
14:05
works I did you will do they do also and
14:11
greater works you will do I think that
14:18
means we're socially doing something
14:22
we're entering into a busy season a busy
14:26
season operating in the supernatural not
14:29
just talking about it a busy season
14:32
handling the wealth of the wicked not
14:34
just talking about it a busy season
14:38
living not just existing doing the more
14:43
say the more the more is amazing are you
14:49
getting better I am just as passionate
14:56
about living holy as I am about being
15:00
funny and I will tell you I I have to I
15:04
have to give you both sides of heaven
15:07
there's two sides in heaven there's holy
15:10
profound the other whole half of heaven
15:13
is funny say funny everybody have
15:19
they've thought for ever and for ages
15:22
that it would be boring in heaven maybe
15:24
because all they do is worship let me
15:27
tell you you stand in front of him it's
15:28
not boring
15:30
whether you're staring feeling like
15:33
you're going to faint melting to the
15:34
ground you know you feel like you don't
15:37
have breath in you because of just being
15:39
near him yeah it is an honor a privilege
15:42
and amazing when you worship and it's
15:44
not normal not even worship as normal in
15:48
heaven you ride on it you create things
15:53
as you're worshiping him you're creating
15:56
when you worship given the devil a big
16:00
black eye and a very bad day when you
16:04
worship Him you are shredding bashing
16:07
and crushing his fake little wannabe
16:09
Kingdom
16:10
in the second heaven when you worship
16:12
Him it's amazing from doing one thing
16:17
for him to honor him to bless him to
16:21
adore him
16:22
what destruction you do against the
16:24
kingdom of darkness that's my favorite
16:27
second thing I don't do demons I do do
16:34
Jesus though I love him I honor him I
16:38
can't do anything without him it's
16:40
because of him and with him and it is
16:43
his plan even the pink hair is his plan
16:47
because he's not boring there's nothing
16:51
boring about him there's absolutely
16:53
nothing boring about heaven there's
16:55
nothing boring about our future
16:58
that's like in the next few days the
17:03
more you believe things are real the
17:06
more real they will become and that is
17:10
actually a spiritual truth it's a spirit
17:13
realm truth the more you believe it is
17:15
real and talk about it being real and
17:18
write about it being real and actually
17:20
acting in it being real the more real
17:23
it's going to become to you it's the
17:26
original realm it's the eternal realm
17:29
it's not the temporary realm this is a
17:32
temporary life for you
17:33
it's a temporary place to live a
17:36
temporary to do things because this
17:38
earth is not eternal I know people have
17:41
worked it out in their own mind with
17:43
their head research and they're looking
17:45
up stuff and sometimes assuming because
17:49
I've read a lot of translations and
17:51
someone kind of miss it I know because
17:54
the Holy Spirit shows me those
17:55
scriptures then he'll show me 30
17:58
scriptures of it being translated I take
18:04
the word for the value it gives it's
18:07
real it is for us to repair us to
18:12
accelerate us to propel us into high
18:15
places you never dreamed of doing things
18:18
you never dreamed of we are living
18:21
examples of the
18:23
Father Son and Holy Spirit on this earth
18:26
that's why you're here you here to be
18:29
like them look like them and act like
18:32
them I don't see any failure in any of
18:36
that I don't see hopelessness
18:38
worthlessness I don't see fear at all
18:43
one of the first things the Holy Spirit
18:45
gives me these Kingdom quotes it's what
18:47
we decided to call him there's so many
18:49
we don't know what to call and we didn't
18:50
just say a quote the Holy Spirit is a
18:52
Kingdom quote was don't let fear
18:55
interfere that was a good one right
19:00
teach me never to fear never say never
19:03
at all in any way fear does not control
19:09
our life we do not partner with fear he
19:12
didn't put fear in us when he made us
19:16
we're supposed to be fearless and
19:21
timeless everybody should be yelling I
19:24
receive it say timeless we're supposed
19:31
to be timeless he said you had to die
19:38
I'm being serious not funny now serious
19:42
John didn't have to die did he say no
19:52
didn't Jesus say to the disciples what
19:55
is it so in other words he's saying it
19:56
doesn't matter what they think
19:58
you probably actually said that he's a
20:01
character he's the son of God but he is
20:04
a character the problem with the biggest
20:06
characters in heaven except for Holy
20:07
Spirit Holy Spirit has gotten beat by by
20:09
that much who they called the drama King
20:14
Jesus is the king of kings Holy Spirit
20:19
is a drama King you haven't only seen
20:22
just a little bit of his activity so far
20:24
waiting to the full fledge release on
20:27
this earth
20:30
he's excited he's excited about what's
20:34
about to happen in us they've been
20:37
waiting a long time say they've been
20:38
waiting a long time if I say the word
20:42
day I mean the Trinity they're not
20:46
boring
20:47
none of them they know how to step
20:50
inside of each other and be one one
20:52
thing that's how it happens I know I was
20:56
eight years old father caught me up
20:59
before the throne and said I'm going to
21:00
show you how the three can be one and a
21:03
five-year-old can understand that man's
21:05
head knowledge has expanded it and
21:08
expanded it and all kind of could use
21:10
every other kind of word explaining that
21:12
you know multiply it whatever you want
21:13
to call it made it look amazing powerful
21:15
and hard to understand it's simple they
21:21
can step inside of each other Jesus said
21:24
father I pray that one day that they be
21:27
one even as we are one because he steps
21:31
inside his father all the time when he
21:35
was the word he did the same thing I
21:37
didn't forget I was only on number three
21:40
bulletins by the way I've got some more
21:41
I was the least likely person to anyone
21:49
on this earth would have chosen to do
21:50
this okay I'm from a tribe like a real
21:54
one 15 people in an alligator and an
21:59
iguana innumerable amount of toad frogs
22:02
and lizards and spiders we grew up with
22:06
them in our home I had seven brothers
22:10
what did you think in Florida
22:12
you add that up that's what that comes
22:14
to sell your bike to some kid for a pig
22:17
bring him home wrap him up and close and
22:19
you have a new pet overnight we never
22:23
knew what was going to be in our home so
22:26
I didn't need anyone's opinions I was
22:29
never part of a group or a clique I had
22:30
a tribe God did that to kill me I'm a
22:35
dead person standing before you dead
22:39
people are wonderful for God to use
22:42
they're not full of self they don't have
22:46
their own opinion and the devil cannot
22:49
use a dead person the more dead you are
22:54
to yourself the more dangerous you are
22:57
against hell there are many ways to kill
23:02
me
23:03
before I even grew up and you know it
23:06
doesn't matter I mean I love everyone in
23:08
this room I loved all my siblings I
23:10
survived I conquered I was a leader
23:13
wasn't liked all the time but I was a
23:18
big help to my parents I honor my
23:20
parents greatly every day of my life I
23:22
loved them I didn't want to hurt them
23:26
they needed help say parents they need
23:31
help pastors they need more help
23:39
I'm grateful people can start a church
23:41
Oh No I've already died I don't need a
23:45
church I don't need a whole
23:47
congregations of people although I love
23:50
them I bless you all but I really bless
23:53
the pastor because they die every day to
23:58
be that amen
24:00
you'll notice that God didn't actually
24:04
send his son to be a pastor did you ever
24:07
notice that they actually sent him as a
24:10
businessman
24:11
God loves business people they're easy
24:14
they know how to listen they know how to
24:17
complete things that are given to them
24:19
they don't leave things out forget
24:20
things ignore things they do a job amen
24:24
so he sent his son as a businessman who
24:26
could easily connect with the sinners
24:30
and he did they ate with him all the
24:34
time they liked him he was exciting he
24:38
was interesting he was funny his
24:42
favorite job was to offend the hierarchy
24:47
he was good at it
24:50
and yet lived holy did miracles raise
24:54
the dead they took money from people for
24:57
spotted lambs they weren't high on God's
25:01
list and he had to train his disciples I
25:12
know he only had him for three years and
25:15
I think most of them finally got it
25:17
after he left but they did give him
25:21
credit they did but in the beginning I'm
25:25
sure Jesus would go to the Father when
25:27
he went to the mountain all the time and
25:28
say are you sure I have to that fight
25:33
all the time
25:34
they brawl over women I have one who
25:38
wants to be everything until everybody
25:40
that that would be Peter I have a
25:43
treasure you know that cheats all the
25:45
time right you know that you know he
25:48
takes money all the time I know you know
25:50
that too
25:51
and I have a tax collector and every
25:53
time you walk down the road to go
25:55
Minister we get stones thrown at us
25:56
because they don't like him I don't know
25:59
anybody who likes tax clusters they
26:01
didn't back then either so he did not
26:05
give him the best or the easiest to
26:08
Train and I know I was saying something
26:12
to God about my some of my staff and he
26:16
said I didn't make it easy for my son in
26:18
my conversation ended with that subject
26:22
especially when he caught me up me took
26:24
me back and I got to walk through a
26:26
whole day of their lives
26:28
like in their first year of being
26:30
together all right God I can make it God
26:38
has a plan for you every single person
26:41
is important to him and I do know this
26:44
your birth was timed on this earth God
26:50
created time he knew you before you were
26:53
born because you played inside of him he
26:56
saw you if there was time he saw you all
27:00
the time how great is
27:03
see that he was huge he could make
27:05
himself as big as he wanted to and he
27:07
walked on the mountains he was out where
27:10
there was nothing and he spoke and the
27:12
world would step out of him and make
27:13
space that God would make himself small
27:21
enough to step inside himself and play
27:23
with you he did say he's not a man he's
27:32
God and even being that great he knew
27:36
everything about you knew the mistakes
27:40
knew our faults knew everything that had
27:43
great hope and great plans for you to do
27:47
great things so it's no mistake you're
27:49
here now in this age instead of the ages
27:53
before this time you're here right on
27:55
time for the accelerator time for the
27:59
more of God for the kingdom age for the
28:05
time to command the hosts of heaven
28:07
handle the wealth by host cities for him
28:12
to use because he's not poor he knows
28:18
the names of your children that you'll
28:20
have even before you get married he
28:22
knows them and he put them in your
28:25
family line on purpose in this
28:29
generation that's here now this is a
28:31
special generation for God it's the
28:34
beginning of the group and type of
28:36
people that will remain until all things
28:39
be fulfilled some well the Bible says
28:47
there'll be a group of people like that
28:48
a group and type of people a generation
28:51
that we're generation means a group and
28:54
type of people it doesn't mean like 30
28:56
years or actually that word in the Bible
28:59
that says Jesus says that there'll be a
29:03
group and Type O people on earth that
29:04
will be here when all things be
29:05
fulfilled including the coming of him
29:08
that word means a group and type of
29:11
people that work generation means that
29:14
there will be a grouping type of people
29:16
on this earth that also says in the
29:18
Bible that would taste of the powers say
29:21
powers of the age to come that would be
29:29
the Millennial age of course there's
29:32
people now let's say they're not going
29:33
to be in millennium I go about what the
29:37
Bible says there will be a millennium
29:40
there will be a Tribulation God caused a
29:43
bump in the road it will happen that's
29:48
on his timeline in heaven so no matter
29:53
what other people have come come up with
29:55
or assume or have putting in
29:56
translations I promise you it's going to
29:59
happen and you can't make it happen or
30:01
not happen anyway so to me it's not
30:02
worth agreeing over God's gonna work out
30:06
his plan all the way to the end right
30:09
I'm excited to know that I'm part of
30:12
that generation that will tasted the
30:14
powers of the age to come
30:16
that's why you need revelation because
30:21
that that all that comes from the heart
30:24
of God he already knows what it's going
30:27
to look like she knows what's gonna
30:28
happen
30:29
so he chose you to be here to be a part
30:32
say Amen that word means so be yet might
30:39
as well say it gonna happen there's no
30:43
one on the earth in the earth around the
30:47
earth say it's round I gotta say that
30:50
the Holy Spirit won't let it go okay so
30:54
that's him say the earth is round not
30:59
flat they don't have edges you may say
31:03
that property does not have edges there
31:05
you go
31:06
Holy Spirit truck can we use proper
31:08
grammar Ben m8 that's how they say it
31:14
there is a whole group of people that
31:16
sincerely spend so much time and money
31:20
to try to prove the earth is flat I'd
31:23
rather use that money in that time and
31:24
energy ruling
31:26
right I've flown many times and I didn't
31:31
get halfway around the world then all of
31:32
a sudden here's the flat earth and I'm
31:35
flying it didn't all of a sudden go wait
31:36
shh now you're on the other side no I
31:40
went around besides I've already been up
31:44
over the earth it's round
31:48
God made it round he says he sits on the
31:52
circle of the earth not the square you'd
31:58
be surprised how serious they are they
32:02
think NASA has spent billions of dollars
32:04
faking it and none of that stuff is real
32:08
I don't know who got that thought but it
32:11
didn't come from heaven a man so just
32:17
rest assured that it's around okay been
32:21
there seen that it is round and when I
32:24
almost shown it God caught me up in
32:25
space up and do like like first space
32:28
not I've been way up there but the first
32:30
time he caught me up and showed me the
32:32
earth he put a grid you know like a grid
32:35
you know what that is yeah a grid was
32:38
round and he put it right on the earth
32:40
cheol-ho together and then they begin to
32:42
draw things on this grid that was his
32:45
plan that was called space planning that
32:47
was also the Holy Spirit's joke he's out
32:50
in space put the grid than planned right
32:53
uses every opportunity to be funny so he
32:58
did show me his space planning for like
33:01
the next hundred years that was probably
33:06
15 20 years ago when he showed me that
33:09
that doesn't mean the earth is going to
33:12
end in a hundred years
33:13
except been taken further than that and
33:16
no tribulation had happened I know some
33:20
people think it's supposed to be right
33:21
now well if it was it would be people
33:26
get to heaven they all find out man we
33:29
wasted so much time sitting on our
33:30
rapture rug
33:36
she to roll it up put it in the closet
33:43
well you've you've been around a long
33:45
time you realize I went to church
33:48
everyday it was open and every day
33:51
someone said Jesus could come tomorrow
33:54
and in my I'm like little this is like
33:57
little I had these thoughts why would he
34:00
have all these plans in the Bible and go
34:02
okay not forget that we're just all
34:03
going home I mean he gave my dad a long
34:08
plan I mean my dad knew him he gave him
34:11
a long plan I mean he's not going to
34:12
where we haven't done what God told us
34:14
to do yet
34:15
and God said well many people are in
34:18
fear and they know one day that will
34:21
happen so they want it to come so to
34:24
them that's logical they don't
34:25
understand a lot especially in the book
34:27
of Revelation say revelations means
34:31
revelations that means something you
34:35
don't know so God said I'm calling you a
34:39
Revelator me you know why he did that so
34:41
people couldn't call me a false prophet
34:43
they don't know what a Revelator is so
34:45
they didn't never say nothing against it
34:50
they couldn't say well she's not a
34:54
terrible pastor no he can't call an
34:57
evangelist she doesn't go out and win
34:58
lots of millions we can't call her that
34:59
huh can't call her prophet she's a
35:03
Revelator don't know what that is so
35:04
we'll ignore all of that a Revelator is
35:10
someone who reveals like John did caught
35:14
up showing the future the future no know
35:17
what that was that was a bling glitch
35:19
write that down and don't forget it I
35:21
know Jen is writing it down right now if
35:25
I say word she goes you did a bling
35:26
glitch that means you blended some words
35:28
together okay I won't explain it yes
35:35
you've been there I'm sure people been
35:37
there right you've been there well at
35:40
least I'm not talking about noses
35:42
putting the animals on the art tonight
35:44
that's Moses and Noah doing it together
35:50
when Donna even said Adam did it I did
35:55
hear from people I have a bloopers thing
36:00
one day and just put them all on there
36:01
go there and look at it but now I forget
36:07
we're talking about who is listening
36:12
Revelator you're right so see I hear
36:22
them all the time I have to fight when
36:25
you're eight you need help so he didn't
36:31
pick me to be a professor you know I was
36:34
graduated middle of my class like
36:37
literally middle we had six hundred
36:40
graduating students we have a lot of
36:43
people coming to Florida to go to school
36:45
I guess they like it we're pretty
36:47
laid-back there you know and so it's a
36:51
nice place to live if you want to come
36:52
live someplace different go good
36:55
vacation time try not to come in August
37:00
really hot so being a Revelator's a
37:07
little bit different that usually
37:09
doesn't mean profit just so you've
37:10
wondered you know John was a men and
37:16
it's okay I love doing that but I love
37:20
being with my father my heavenly father
37:24
him all the time I know why Jesus loved
37:29
him so much I know why he wanted to be
37:31
with him I know why he went away to the
37:33
mountain to spend time with him I know
37:36
how hard it was for him to leave home
37:37
and come here okay he was not poor he
37:42
didn't live poor say Jesus was not poor
37:48
he became poor when he left heaven
37:52
because heaven is certainly not poor
37:56
there's nothing poor up there nothing
38:00
splendor and wandering beauty you
38:03
couldn't afford to build the house that
38:05
you're mentioned that your mother lives
38:07
in you wouldn't even have the right
38:10
substances to make it the walls sing
38:15
literally they sing they leave you go on
38:18
tours come back they sing hello to them
38:21
the trees uproot their self and they
38:23
come and sit in your house and be your
38:27
friend for a while they'll go back to
38:29
the friendly forest is this ok it's not
38:36
gonna be normal no you can't be normal
38:41
you've been going to heaven for 20 years
38:43
you be normal to heaven they tell funny
38:48
stories a lot Bob Jones hasn't stopped
38:57
most people when they go there no matter
38:59
how they were here they're all happy
39:01
they love jokes they love to tell funny
39:03
stories hear funny stories they love it
39:06
they make plans for people before they
39:08
come they knew Paul was coming they all
39:15
knew Paul is coming there's a place you
39:19
go in heaven where you find that out and
39:24
you go in this beautiful amazing
39:26
building and these supernatural monitors
39:29
much better than ours but these are good
39:32
and you can see who's coming home who's
39:35
about to come home to heaven everybody
39:37
starts getting things ready they're so
39:38
excited they're there beside their self
39:40
they want to make sure they're all there
39:42
say all to meet you at the gate they
39:48
have a huge celebration they plan one
39:51
themselves heaven plans one the throne
39:53
room plans one people have celebrations
39:56
in the street over someone coming home
39:59
stay home it's because that's where you
40:03
came from we were alone to the earth for
40:07
a while when you go home
40:09
you are really home and you're not dead
40:13
they don't throw parties for people who
40:16
aren't alive they have huge celebrations
40:21
lots of music lots of food everyone
40:25
meeting one another
40:26
visiting Jesus welcomes you if he isn't
40:31
taking you himself sometimes he does
40:34
take people he comes into his own
40:35
chariot flaming horses picks you up and
40:38
takes you up to heaven then when you get
40:42
out you see the sea or the mass of
40:44
people waiting to greet you and then
40:49
Jesus walks you up the steps of the
40:51
throne to give you back to the Father
40:54
and then the father reaches out of that
40:58
glory that moves in and out of him the
41:01
Living colors of the bow coming in and
41:04
out his eyes flames of fire passion for
41:07
you just glowing and he reaches his arms
41:11
out and grabs you he says welcome home
41:14
my son welcome home my daughter you go
41:17
home as his children say we are his
41:20
offspring every morning gets their own
41:24
mansion you don't have to share it with
41:27
your brother or sister I'll have my own
41:31
one day it's made exactly the way you
41:37
would love it but it's made with his
41:40
presence in the walls and the floors and
41:42
it's not gonna be a normal shape trust
41:45
me it's not all your pets to be there
41:47
they'll be waiting to greet you eating
41:51
your food at your table your family
41:59
members will all have gifts for you for
42:01
every year you've been apart they will
42:03
get a gift that represents that year and
42:05
put it in your mansion after your
42:08
welcome home party in the throne room
42:10
which could last for quite a while
42:13
your family will come get you and take
42:16
you to your own mansion then they'll
42:17
have another celebration
42:22
everybody laughs and filled with joy to
42:27
see all the ones they loved before
42:29
little tiny babies they never got to
42:31
raise they get their children given to
42:33
them to raise the same one that you that
42:37
didn't make it all the way through amen
42:41
God keeps them they live with your
42:44
grandparents or whoever when they get
42:46
there they'll go get them and help raise
42:48
them for a while I love the story of a
42:51
mother they lost their son he was either
42:55
7 or 8 he was hit by a car and they of
42:59
course they they grieved over him but
43:01
knew he was in heaven and I think it was
43:03
like 20 years later or 30 years later
43:05
one of the other huh
43:06
she died on the operating table and was
43:10
caught up to heaven saw her
43:12
seven-year-old son playing in the
43:15
streets of gold he goes mom Wow mom
43:18
you're here this is so exciting
43:20
your mom I'm so glad you're here and you
43:22
cuz what have you been doing goes I've
43:24
been playing with my friends what you
43:25
think I've been doing he's been living
43:29
with his grandfather and playing with
43:31
all these friends and the streets to go
43:33
they were playing and he was laughing
43:35
and he said but you can't come yet
43:37
because it's not your time
43:38
and so she came back never forgot it and
43:43
her and her husband went around the
43:45
world talking about it you will be known
43:48
as you are known except you look better
43:53
like a whole lot better you'll have hair
44:01
most guys wear their hair about down to
44:04
their shoulders don't have you know
44:06
that's gonna change y'all I'm just
44:08
letting you know I can't change guys
44:10
unless you really want like a buzz cut
44:13
or something no Marine Corps or my
44:18
husband may still have one I would might
44:20
be surprised to see him alive yeah he's
44:25
still with me by the way another way to
44:26
kill me but that was okay
44:34
it's all worth everything it's worth it
44:40
all no matter what you surrender give up
44:44
miss doing it's worth it and you'll be
44:49
so happy when you stand before God and
44:52
you're welcomed home knowing that you
44:55
gave everything you could not saying you
44:58
have to walk around poor okay that was
45:00
the devil's plan not God's his plan is
45:04
to bless us say bless us and prosper us
45:10
it'll be worth it some people have
45:13
already seen Jesus here right how many
45:15
people have seen Jesus let me see either
45:18
in a vision or dream or in reality if
45:20
you've seen him how many people have
45:22
been encountered an angel there's
45:24
usually a lot there's a lot of people
45:26
here it's going to happen that's part of
45:28
the acceleration that's part of the more
45:31
it's a lot of them more actually that we
45:35
will see angels and they will probably
45:37
be talking to us they came from God
45:41
ignore what we've all been told our
45:42
whole lives don't talk to angels they
45:46
did in the Bible amen
45:49
there's gonna be a lot more of that
45:51
angelic not just visitation because what
45:55
we're going to experience is the
45:56
habitation heavens not coming for a
45:59
visit a heaven
46:01
is not coming for a visit they're coming
46:04
for a habitation you're part of the
46:09
habitation you are all of you sitting
46:11
here say I'm alive and breathing I'm
46:15
part of the habitation but God is about
46:22
to do on this earth does not just take a
46:25
territory here and there what the
46:28
habitation will be is in us say in us
46:34
that's the part of the habitation that's
46:36
why me and won't be able to control it
46:38
like they have in the past say God will
46:42
be in charge
46:45
it's a habitation and it will remain for
46:49
a long time he's gonna transform this
46:53
world right now he is shifting
46:55
government so he can shape Nations it's
47:04
part of the platform he's giving us in
47:06
the habitation
47:07
he's got platforms for us that's the
47:12
place that we will operate from and
47:14
speak from shake things cause things to
47:19
be released to change for him it's not a
47:26
lot of how it's always been in the past
47:28
that's why it's a new thing say a new
47:30
thing it's time for the new thing it's
47:37
where we will be ruling it's one of the
47:40
purposes that Christ died for us that's
47:43
why he went into hell and wasted it took
47:47
back the authority and Dominion the Adam
47:49
had given away he gave it to us he also
47:54
gave his power over all the power of the
47:57
enemy say we have power over all the
48:03
power of the enemy say he did not give
48:10
that to the Angels that's why we need to
48:16
command them they can't just go tear up
48:20
any demon they see they just can't do
48:23
that
48:23
they do it in in the past it was from
48:25
answers to prayer and prayers never
48:27
going to go away it's never gonna go
48:29
away
48:30
he loves prayer prayer is powerful it's
48:33
gonna get even more powerful especially
48:37
when you command part of an army of
48:38
heaven and they pull down strongholds
48:41
for you and crush the plains of darkness
48:46
we need this say we need it
48:49
to rule in this day say every King gets
48:55
the Kingdom and gets an army if we're
48:59
part of the kingdom we get part of the
49:03
army did you ever see a king a natural
49:08
King on this earth title rule with that
49:09
one they wouldn't go very far with a
49:13
they'd be overrun beaten up things
49:17
stolen things killed someone's like the
49:20
devil he comes to kill steal and destroy
49:30
that's what the army prevents heavens
49:35
army was designed created and made every
49:38
one of them unique and different but
49:42
they are fierce they have one job the
49:47
ones under Gabriel have many different
49:49
jobs many different positions to do many
49:52
different things but but Michael is over
49:56
one specific part and that is the army
50:00
they have a headquarters they have
50:02
barracks they have training fields
50:05
they're all in the sky of heaven Rand
50:08
maneuvers for ages in the past Jesus
50:12
would go send up Michael to gather the
50:15
army from the far ends of heaven to
50:18
fight on behalf of Israel people say
50:20
Amen
50:20
it's in the Bible go read it sometimes
50:25
they even fought the flesh did you know
50:27
that yeah some of them could fight the
50:30
flesh in this time on earth it's mostly
50:36
battles in the spirit battling the
50:39
demonic even those in the high places
50:42
the principalities and the powers the
50:46
things the beings in wickedness in high
50:48
places many of those high places will be
50:51
shredded and pulled down say our weapons
50:58
they are mighty to the pulling down of
51:03
strongholds that's one of the things the
51:07
army does I can only share what I have
51:13
been told and I can only tell you what I
51:16
have been shown shown and told that's
51:21
what I talk about but they didn't just
51:24
show me things and tell me things I had
51:26
to live it every way something mom is
51:29
trained in it was for the body of Christ
51:32
so I had to live it to let you know it's
51:36
real and it really does work she follow
51:39
heavens protocol see on earth as it is
51:44
in heaven
51:45
that's what we've been asking for for
51:49
generations we should have expected it
51:56
jesus bushwhacked us all he did he told
52:01
me is it I knew if I taught them that
52:03
and said you say that eventually it
52:06
would come you mean one thing I could
52:10
get them to agree on no matter what
52:14
denomination they rod to clear that
52:17
prayer because they need us to call
52:21
things in is that right you have not
52:27
because you ask not
52:31
if you've ever said to Jesus I'll give
52:34
you anything you want no matter what it
52:36
is where it is what time it is I give
52:39
you permission to use me as anyone ever
52:41
says something like that let me see your
52:44
hands
52:45
well I'll get ready because he's calling
52:51
in those words yes it's gonna be amazing
52:56
say amazing heaven is amazing it's gonna
53:01
be amazing here we can live on earth
53:04
like they live in heaven which is mainly
53:08
his will being done
53:11
his way say his way not our way that's
53:18
part of the more she's gonna do new
53:21
thing he goes revelation and then ways
53:25
for you to use that revelation it means
53:28
a lot of things are gonna change so if
53:31
you're stuck in your own mind or your
53:33
own mindset of what you think is gonna
53:35
happen and because it didn't it's not
53:37
going to you need to just so that away
53:40
because he does have a timeline in his
53:44
own throne room and those dots on that
53:47
timeline is when his things are going to
53:50
happen regardless of what anybody on the
53:54
earth is doing it's his sovereign will
53:57
and what right now this time we're in
54:00
it's on his timeline it is many of the
54:04
generals are going home doesn't mean
54:07
they'll be oblivious to what we're doing
54:10
that means they'll know all about it
54:12
after they get there and the thing
54:13
they'll be celebrating is us who are
54:15
still down here being a part of it so
54:21
God really needs us right now he's
54:34
intimidating me although I probably
54:36
would have never chosen except when he
54:40
asked me I said yes say it's important
54:44
to say yes to being chosen many are
54:50
called but few are chosen because they
54:55
don't choose that's why many aren't
54:59
chosen he can't make you do it right
55:04
you're called you're being called but he
55:07
can't make you do that you have to
55:09
choose yes and when you do that you're
55:11
saying yes I want to be chosen and then
55:14
you're chosen what does it take to be
55:15
chosen say choose yes
55:21
then you got to be willing he makes it a
55:23
little bit you know gotta be willing and
55:25
obedient say willing obedience next say
55:35
surrender is not control a lot of people
55:42
think it is because you know God does
55:45
have he does have I'm trying to think of
55:52
the natural earthward it's like not
55:54
there he does have guidelines is that
56:00
right even Jesus had them that he
56:03
operated by Jesus didn't just pick
56:06
things on his own all the time where did
56:10
he say I do yeah what his father said
56:17
right but he showed him and what he told
56:20
him that's what he did that's why we
56:24
need revelation otherwise we're gonna
56:27
get man's mind set on everything and
56:30
that hasn't worked well has it he's not
56:36
going to abandon the church I've heard
56:39
all kinds of things when people's gonna
56:40
abandon the church it's just gonna go
56:42
away burn down we don't need it anymore
56:45
let's get rid of it when he's not saying
56:47
that to me he's going to set it on fire
56:52
amen this is a time to be willing and
56:56
obedient if you want to eat the fat of
56:59
the land and Jesus did ask us to pray
57:03
about one other thing pray that my
57:05
people say we are his people be willing
57:11
and the day of his power well obviously
57:16
if he's going to give us revelation to
57:18
operate like he does and part of that is
57:22
power
57:22
he says he'll give you power over all
57:25
the part of the enemy there's one right
57:26
there
57:26
he's given us power and he does have
57:31
power
57:33
so if this is the day of his power the
57:36
biggest thing the most important thing
57:37
is remember the willing and obedient
57:38
thing what he asked probably won't seem
57:42
natural or normal to you wasn't natural
57:46
normal to ask me to have pink hair I
57:49
wasn't a pink haired person I liked it
57:53
he wouldn't have asked me it's better
57:57
than camel hair I like pink here any day
58:02
over camel hair it smells it's stiff not
58:09
comfortable and he had to wrap himself
58:11
in it okay my pink hair is a test it
58:18
divides asunder the Spirit from the
58:21
flesh so those who trash or bash it or
58:26
in the flash are we still so walking the
58:30
flash say no we're supposed to walk in
58:35
the so people don't have to tell me if
58:40
they're hearing their flesh or hearing
58:42
their spirit it's the way they react to
58:45
the pink care now people who like pink
58:48
hair they think is amazing so the world
58:49
must be passing their tests because they
58:53
all love it that's amazing you look
58:56
amazing what do you do I'm a
58:59
spokesperson for haven't I've been there
59:02
and then they all say the same thing
59:05
they don't say you're liar your father's
59:07
property was that they go what was it
59:09
like what was it like is it beautiful is
59:14
it amazing is it real is is God real is
59:16
there a god and go oh yes there is a God
59:20
and you lived inside of him before you
59:22
came here okay that makes him interested
59:26
not bashing amen
59:30
try that next time you did live in him
59:36
you moved in and out of him he was your
59:39
very existence you had your very
59:40
existence in him that's why he knew you
59:43
that's why he saw you before he sent you
59:46
here you're wonderfully and perfectly
59:51
made your souls were the most amazing
59:54
parts of you of all you change your very
59:57
life by what you feed it you change how
60:01
you feel about things by what you say
60:04
yourself if you don't like you then
60:08
change change what you're saying change
60:12
what you're watching change what you let
60:14
other people say around you because you
60:16
need to guard your heart what goes in
60:20
there is what you will become
60:22
amen if you've never heard that before
60:26
it's Revelation on your soul your soul
60:28
is what you are people say well I'm
60:32
missing that no Adam became a living
60:36
Saint loud he became a living soul
60:43
that's how important it is to God that's
60:45
why he gave you a soul you could choose
60:47
yourself you could choose with your will
60:50
you can think about things choose it and
60:52
then you do it and then your emotions
60:56
display who and what you believe with
61:00
your life it's probably one of the least
61:03
talked about things in the church it's a
61:06
soul growing up I always heard that it
61:09
was bad and went but God made it right
61:13
he it's one third of us is that right
61:16
we'll always have our soul
61:18
why would he make it bad it's a powerful
61:22
thing and it's a good thing because you
61:25
can feel yourself with God and then
61:26
you'll be like him you can talk about
61:29
him then you really believe he is real
61:32
you can feed your soul 24 hours a day
61:36
your body gets fed a few times a day
61:39
your spirit man gets fed once a week
61:43
most people go to church once a week but
61:48
your souls fed all the time by what you
61:52
watch what you say what people say to
61:54
you you can be crushed by tragedies and
61:57
you can't you can't forget it you hang
61:59
on to it somebody
62:00
you wound and hurt eunuch stays there
62:02
forever your soul has layers and it
62:06
collects things in those layers that's
62:09
why you have a memory but your layers
62:12
are supposed to be used for different
62:13
something different than that every
62:16
layer of you looks like you who wants
62:19
revelation on the soul let me see your
62:20
hand I was shown one and the father
62:26
spent four hours with me earth time I
62:28
never usually know but I looked at my
62:30
clock and I was talking to him then he
62:32
just catches me up and begins to show me
62:35
a human soul what it look like how he
62:37
made it why did he make it that way how
62:39
people can cause her soul to prosper all
62:41
the time and then they live in divine
62:43
health there was a requirement about
62:47
that prospering it says even as your
62:51
soul prospers you will prosper and you
62:55
will be in health that where B means lib
62:59
it's called divine health so I since I
63:05
learned about the father taught me about
63:07
that he said people can loose with the
63:09
keys of the kingdom you can loose things
63:10
out of your soul when you loose it it's
63:13
gone
63:14
and that doesn't matter what it is he
63:17
started giving me this very long list of
63:19
things that you can loose from your soul
63:21
and he said I know most people buying
63:24
the devil but the keys to the kingdom
63:26
but they mostly never talked about the
63:29
loosing thing what are gonna do with the
63:30
loosing key and yet the binding key is
63:34
more important to bind the things of God
63:37
to your soul because then they can't be
63:38
taken away what you choose to bind to
63:43
your soul about God will never be taken
63:46
from you and so people I know you know
63:51
if you still want to bind the devil go
63:52
ahead and do it I'd rather loose the
63:56
stuff out of my soul that he tried
63:57
putting there you know if you have an
64:00
anger issue in your anger anger angry
64:02
all the time you don't even know you're
64:03
just angry it's all it comes out of you
64:05
it's in your soul you choose with your
64:08
will to loose that's that anger then
64:12
heaven comes down and they pull it out
64:14
saywhat sluiced on earth is loosed in
64:18
heaven you know how amazing you would be
64:22
if you didn't have all that junk in
64:23
there especially wounds and wounds can
64:28
keep you from the things of God as much
64:31
as sin can don't leave a wound in you
64:35
because then the enemy will come and try
64:37
to use it amen
64:40
so tomorrow night not tonight we're
64:43
gonna do a soul checkup I hope you're
64:47
coming who's coming tomorrow night hope
64:48
everybody's coming home you don't want
64:52
to miss tomorrow night this is just the
64:53
introduction we're gonna do some
64:57
spiritual warfare with the hosts they'll
65:01
be excited you mean leaving an army if
65:04
you don't have one they were made for us
65:08
amen they won't let you worship them
65:11
they don't have time for that and
65:14
neither do you
65:15
amen tomorrow night we're gonna have
65:19
some fire sent the Angels already
65:22
outside waiting but they're gonna do
65:24
that tomorrow night I did this recently
65:27
where I mean people were literally
65:28
flaming like they were flaming because
65:34
this is time just darkening I want to
65:37
say drops of it the fire of God is
65:41
amazing it comes from himself inside him
65:45
say our God is a consuming fire I'm
65:49
about to get consumed it's one of the
65:54
most asked asked things by the body of
65:56
Christ send the fire I want the fire
66:01
give me the fire let me be consumed let
66:03
me burn for you it burns everything off
66:07
the walls of your heart I mean literally
66:09
make sure your heart white you are
66:15
filled with boldness like you've never
66:16
had before in your life you're fearless
66:20
you're bold you you got filled with God
66:23
the fire it burns it out then he puts
66:28
him in
66:28
selves in there he heaps more stones of
66:31
fire inside of you those came from God
66:35
two stones a fire I find a one
66:39
translation said that they were they
66:41
were flaming stones that Satan left on
66:43
some other planet that was in a Bible
66:48
and I already knew what they were so God
66:51
made me look up like 29 different
66:53
translations to go see what they say it
66:54
is like they missed that one no they
66:59
didn't ever belong to Lucifer okay they
67:03
were inside God or he burns with this
67:07
fire for you under the water they burn
67:11
in the River of Life that's in him the
67:14
river flows out of him the gemstones
67:17
flow out of him even the steps of the
67:19
throne room have gemstones they flow out
67:22
of heaven and become the crystal see is
67:24
called the crystal see because there's
67:26
gemstones in it not sand
67:30
that's why it's cut crystal faceted
67:33
gemstones they're all over heaven they
67:36
all come from one place when the father
67:38
and the firewood burn inside of him and
67:41
Lucifer would step in and there's his
67:43
holy mountain inside God say God is not
67:47
a man he doesn't look the same inside
67:52
that we do but we lived there that's why
67:57
we like sparkly things way back in our
68:01
way back in our spirit man we remember
68:06
that we met we remember that there's
68:09
something that connects when we look at
68:11
something that's brilliant and beautiful
68:13
gemstones represent the love of God his
68:17
love his revelation upon this rock I
68:21
know he said Peter was a rock when God
68:24
says rock in the Bible he's talking
68:25
about a gemstone you know that white
68:29
rock that white rock rock or stone
68:31
you're gonna get when you go home to
68:32
heaven and there's a name under the only
68:34
he and you know it's a white diamond
68:37
it's not a River Rock
68:40
every syllabus I ever saw showed a river
68:43
rock when it talked about that that
68:46
stone so inside his eternity you never
68:52
see at the end there's no end inside of
68:56
him no end and we ran up and down this
69:00
mountain and we slid down the river of
69:02
life and would jump on the stones of
69:04
fire through the flames we lived in
69:07
those flames you're about to get
69:10
baptized with him it's amazing I don't
69:16
even know what time it is I better check
69:17
what time is it oh my my see gem she's
69:31
at it you didn't finish talking about
69:35
Ron McClellan remember I was at his
69:41
service right and I can I come in with
69:44
these books in his parents and
69:46
grandparents are sitting on the front
69:47
row I didn't know him so but I knew a
69:49
couple people there at celebration
69:51
Church they let me come in and I just
69:53
was going to wait till everything was
69:55
over and they were everybody with their
69:57
line going by the casket and he had this
70:01
bright yellow suit on I mean bright with
70:05
his big white tie and and he had the
70:07
biggest fro I've ever seen on a human
70:09
they had to stick it down in the casket
70:12
and as I was walking I was walking up I
70:17
looked up I was trying not to laugh out
70:21
loud because it was an open portal and
70:24
he was watching his service and now this
70:27
is a band right band in a van travelling
70:32
telling jokes non-stop doing sock
70:35
puppets you know crazy stuff he did
70:37
crazy things in the van with the guys
70:39
and his band was there and they were
70:42
telling the funniest stories and every
70:44
time they say something funny he would
70:45
go like this is here we go
70:53
so here I'm looking at the casket and
70:56
then I look up there
71:00
he was alive for now and there was a lot
71:02
of funny stories right so I'm like this
71:04
is just this crazy it was so much fun
71:06
and so I went back sat down and then it
71:10
came up when I gave out the books and I
71:13
didn't know who his parents were I knew
71:15
who his wife was and her mom dad were
71:17
there and I gave them one and I didn't
71:21
know that was his father sitting there
71:22
so I was telling you know his wife this
71:24
is a book about heaven I really think it
71:26
a bless you and I started to turn away
71:28
and and the Holy Spirit to tell me take
71:30
an extra one so of course willing and
71:32
obedient I had an extra one in a little
71:35
bag wondering who was gonna give it to
71:36
and he grabbed my arm II said did you
71:38
say that book was about heaven
71:40
I said yes I I've been there he says can
71:42
I have that book and I said yes yes you
71:45
can have and he goes well I'm Randstad
71:48
well was then this was for you because I
71:51
didn't know you were gonna be here but
71:53
he told me to bring it so this is your
71:55
book and a few months later I get a
71:57
phone call it's always in the middle of
71:59
night and it's his parents and they're
72:02
undone they were so full of joy in
72:04
celebration after reading about what
72:07
heaven was like they already knew what
72:09
their son would be doing having a band
72:10
and he does have a man and it's called
72:12
the other side of the story his heaven
72:17
he went from story side be to the other
72:20
side of the story that was his bayum but
72:23
in the band
72:24
angels were playing and singing with him
72:27
because he said he wouldn't let anyone
72:29
take the place of his band when they
72:31
came to heaven which I told their band
72:34
and so his parents called they were
72:37
really excited about everything and and
72:39
then I they gave me their daughter's
72:42
phone number he and his sister were
72:43
really close together and so I called
72:46
and just spoke to her for a few minutes
72:48
and and then about I don't know it was
72:50
probably a year later she called me she
72:51

73:00
still think about me because we had
73:02
planned a big celebration on this day
73:04
we didn't know he'd go home so I while
73:08
she's on the phone to me God caught me
73:09
up to heaven and I saw her brother
73:13
standing at a portal
73:15
this goes sound wild but it didn't
73:17
matter he was throwing Cheetos at her
73:19
from the portal and he was singing the
73:24
worst rendition of happy birthday I've
73:27
ever heard and this is a guy who sings
73:28
sent was singing for a living right
73:30
like me and this that's awful that's
73:33
awful
73:33
and then God sends me back and I'm she's
73:38
still going on the phone I said wait a
73:39
minute wait wait wait wait wait I got to
73:40
you hey I don't know what you can think
73:42
about this but I got to tell you what
73:43
what I just saw in heaven I saw your
73:46
brother and he was throwing Cheetos over
73:49
the portal at you and she starts to yell
73:52
and scream she goes that that's she said
73:57
he even had a throw by he run by what do
74:02
you want a Cheeto throwing whatever he
74:04
had her fro to so he said his greatest
74:07
thing to do was run through the room and
74:10
throw as many Cheetos in her fro that
74:12
would stick there and she said he did it
74:16
all the time and I was so irritated but
74:17
now it's the most precious thing in the
74:19
world that you told me that because I
74:21
know he didn't forget me this is on her
74:23
birthday remember and I said oh I don't
74:25
know how to tell you this but he he
74:26
sounded the worst I have ever heard
74:29
for someone who's anointed to sing she
74:31
said was it the worst happy birthday you
74:33
ever heard in your life I want ya she
74:35
said he did that every year too so she
74:39
was so blessed to find out she that he
74:43
had not changed he still remembered her
74:46
he was still himself and she was so
74:50
blessed by that so now if Jen there Jen
74:53
I finished the story I'm done with okay
74:56
so I want to encourage you to understand
75:00
that your family still loves you no one
75:04
has forgotten you
75:06
they're making plans for you in this
75:10
little vapor of time that we're in right
75:12
now on this earth use it powerfully
75:17
to love to forgive and to be willing and
75:22
obedient understand John
75:26
his last message loved one another that
75:31
should be the thing we do the most amen
75:33
don't forget to love if you get a choice
75:36
forgive people who are bashing you when
75:39
you do that it really does wound the
75:41
demons and it is our time to torment the
75:44
Nieman's say it's our honor and
75:49
privilege to torment the demons those
75:57
demons ask Jesus have you come to
75:58
torment just before our time that meant
76:01
that was going to be a time when they
76:02
would be tormented is that right but he
76:07
didn't do that he gave us power right so
76:12
stand up for a minute I'm sure that Paul
76:20
is still enjoying his celebration party
76:23
it goes on for quite a while I know that
76:27
has something spent planned for him for
76:30
anyone who ever wanders he made it no
76:36
matter what you thought about his life
76:38
or consider for him he loved God he had
76:44
Christ in his heart he made mistakes he
76:47
repented for them amen and he's highly
76:52
honored and recognized in heaven for
76:54
what he did for God and they're happy to
76:58
have him home and so is his mom amen so
77:03
let's make a declaration I love to make
77:05
declarations say father thank you for
77:11
timing my birth on the earth for right
77:17
now I expect to receive the more to live
77:25

the more it is my commission I'm saying
77:34

77:41

77:47
while I do it I asked for and receive
77:53

77:55
I need fun heaven has fun on earth as it
78:02
is in heaven I want to be dangerous
78:05
against hell the enemy is my doormat but
78:13
I am a ruler with Jesus Christ
78:17
I am royalty I am your son or daughter
78:23
this is the time I've been waiting for
78:29
amen amen sit down
78:55
do people have children here okay yeah I
79:04
don't want to run too late that I don't
79:06

79:31
really want you given I know I'm gonna
79:33
do an impartation tomorrow night I
79:35
really would like to do one tonight I
79:39
[Applause]
79:43
think instead of talking for another 45
79:46
minutes I'd rather do that amen so I'm
79:55
guest tonight because tomorrow night I'm
79:58
probably getting the lightning power God
80:00
last time I did it John G showed up
80:05
that's who I call John G Lake he did he
80:11
came and stood right next to me
80:12
other seers saw him it was really zap
80:16
BAM time but tonight I really want to
80:21
give out a measure of the fire amen I've
80:24
had a measure of baptism and fire and
80:26
let me tell you I've not ever been the
80:28
same so I want you to take it home with
80:31
you let it burn on the inside of you
80:34
don't let the fire go out what you're
80:38
really doing is preparing a place for
80:39
more to come say more say when I receive
80:44
some of something from God I can have
80:49
more
81:03
I know there's major things that are
81:05
about to happen in your lives shifts
81:08
because this is the time to shift
81:10
there's a lot of shifts the other thing
81:13
is suddenly those are two different
81:17
things a suddenly comes when you least
81:21
expect it but just one suddenly can
81:25
change your life it will fill you so
81:28
full of faith when God moves his hand
81:31
for you it's always a good thing
81:33
say suddenly are good things because God
81:39
is preparing you to receive more of him
81:42
amen suddenly just send you over the
81:46
edge probably about half the time
81:52
suddenly czar about finances or wealth
81:56
like a lot not like wow someone gave me
82:00
a hundred dollars like a lot we've had
82:04
quite a few sudden ease ourselves so I'm
82:06
asking God to give you some of those
82:08
also amen
82:10
so when I when I heart fire to you I'm
82:15
gonna add suddenly okay say I want the
82:20
Sun lease say I expect them I'm getting
82:25
ready for them I'm serious I really
82:29
wanted God I'm a suddenly son or
82:33
daughter so send it there you go now you
82:39
set yourself up so I just want to get
82:43
ready to lay hands on people it doesn't
82:48
matter how old you are you can have a
82:49
suddenly and you can also have the fiery
82:51
men I see some kids running around
82:56
they're gonna be fierce I'm talking
82:59
about children yeah I have several
83:05
grandchildren that already are fierce so
83:10
I expect them to be fierce amen say
83:13
fierce
83:15
is a good word in this more time of God
83:20
it's passionate remember the word says
83:25
we take it by force so don't do don't be
83:32
mediocre don't be lukewarm you have to
83:38
take it by force amen
83:41
in the time of John the Baptist until
83:43
now the Kingdom of Heaven stirs up and
83:47
encourages for us to be fierce amen and
83:54
dangerous and violent
83:58
say violence in the spirit realm is a
84:04
good thing when we have it that word
84:10
suffers does not mean that heavens being
84:12
beat up by somebody however back to the
84:15
translations God said go read some of
84:20
the translations and see how they have
84:21
translated or interpreted that verse
84:24
from the time of John the Baptist until
84:26
now the Kingdom of Heaven suffers
84:28
violence and the violent take up by
84:30
force and it literally said people are
84:32
running into heaven and stealing things
84:34
I don't know where they got that heaven
84:38
is under attack no I don't believe that
84:42
for a second it's us who are supposed to
84:47
be violently passionate against the
84:51
enemy and we had the right to take back
84:54
whatever he has taken from us because he
84:57
had no right to it Amen I love giving
85:02
revelation in the word - it actually
85:04
makes sense amen training up your child
85:09
and the gift God put in them whether
85:12
it's a drummer or a baker or an interior
85:14
designer in the never depart from that
85:19
gift because they'll be doing the thing
85:22
they love the most that word in there
85:26
says train up a child in the Ben
85:28
or the way he made them that means who
85:34
he sent you as what gift he made you and
85:36
sent you here every good and perfect
85:38
gift comes down from the Father of
85:40
lights and God said everybody sits on
85:42
the few of the chair every Sunday trying
85:45
to figure out what their spiritual gift
85:47
is but one of the most important gifts
85:52
he gave you is your natural gift your
85:54
passion what you love what he made you
85:57
to be or do in this earth that's not
86:00
your job it's the thing you're the most
86:03
passionate about you know your child is
86:05
a drummer if they beat everything
86:07
everything they have they beat on the
86:08
table with it you know straw spoons
86:11
forks whatever it is you buy them a farm
86:15
you know the farm is set for Christmas
86:17
and they pick them up and start beating
86:18
on something with them the cow and the
86:20
horse here they go take them in a
86:22
restaurant they use the straws take them
86:24
outside so they'll be quiet and then
86:26
they break branches off the bush and
86:27
start drumming with the bush say I think
86:31
they're a drummer so raise them up as a
86:35
drummer and they'll never run around the
86:38
world trying to figure out who they are
86:39
does that scripture make sense it's a
86:43
revelation that's how important your
86:46
natural gift is because when you go to
86:49
heaven he plans to use it it's
86:55
irrevocable you meant to be a baker make
86:58
the best brownies or whatever it is you
87:00
make everybody in the neighborhood loves
87:02
them that everybody tells you to sell
87:03
them when you go home to heaven you're
87:05
going to make that and everybody will
87:07
have it for free and everybody will love
87:10
you they have rodeos amusement parks
87:13
because people have gifts that do that
87:16
is that right that's why we have fun in
87:19
heaven and it's so natural they walk in
87:23
heaven and here's all the stuff they
87:25
need to design and to put together
87:26
something that won't take forever to
87:29
make it you're gonna be a baker as part
87:31
of your mansion you have a full out
87:33
kitchen with supernatural devices to use
87:36
and all the supplies you need and then
87:39
out in the front you have a bakery where
87:41
everybody comes body
87:42
your stuff Jesus will visit you
87:45
regularly he has a sweet tooth that's
87:51
why he liked honeycomb remember we
87:54
served on the beach to his disciples
87:56
remember he served him a meal he gave
87:58
them what fish and say honey when it is
88:05
cousin eat locusts and it ran in the
88:10
family say I'm in the family now I know
88:15
why I have a sweet tooth amen
88:20
okay we're going to we're going to do
88:22

88:25

88:28

88:30

88:32
