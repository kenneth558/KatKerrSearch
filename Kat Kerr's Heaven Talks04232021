02:33
last time we ended on uh the question
02:35
which
02:36
which is why our loved ones
02:39
promote will be promoted to glory early
02:42
so on the continuation of that i want to
02:44
ask you another question
02:48
can can can you actually talk about uh
02:51
maurice's story because
02:52
that that that's my favorite story and
02:55
uh
02:55
uh it will give hope to someone out
02:58
there who lost their loved ones
03:01
yes most of the things i talk about
03:04
especially in the beginning of me going
03:07
out and sharing it was encounters i had
03:10
all the stories in my book are about
03:12
encounters i had
03:13
almost all of my cds dvds whatever is
03:16
put out there is to bring heaven to
03:18
earth
03:19
and the way god did that was he would
03:21
let me have encounters in heaven
03:23
or things about heaven or in time
03:26
and so uh what i would do after i had
03:29
that encounter god would have me come
03:31
back to earth
03:32
write it all down he'd bring me back and
03:34
i would write everything down type into
03:36
my computer
03:37
and date it and it would just be like
03:39
that and i did that for years without
03:41
doing anything in the content and then
03:43
father
03:44
came to me said you're going to start
03:45
sharing all this truth you go back to
03:47
the family members
03:49
that you shared with about their loving
03:51
in heaven
03:52
you get them to approve of what you've
03:55
written
03:56
and then give their viewpoint on how
03:58
they felt when they got that revelation
04:00
and that's what became my books one of
04:03
the most significant ones i had my mom
04:06
and i had agreed to clean the home of
04:09
somebody who had hosted people from out
04:12
of town
04:12
this person did not go to our church we
04:15
went to a church of 4
04:16
000 members and we did hospitality for
04:20
the church
04:20
but the pastor's wife had asked a
04:22
special favor
04:24
that um these people had hosted
04:27
people from other town for a funeral
04:30
and not the funeral was not also not
04:32
held at our church
04:34
just to bless them she was a friend of
04:36
the pastor's wife
04:37
and so we did that we were there
04:39
cleaning and all of a sudden
04:41
the holy spirit and would talk to me
04:44
and then jesus would talk to me and he
04:47
said i want you to give a message to
04:49
melody and i went who's melody
04:53
and he said to me as clear as i'm
04:55
talking to you that is marissa's mother
04:58
and marissa is a young girl who just
05:00
died in the ski accident and her mother
05:03
is grieving very badly and so having
05:06
said those words to me
05:08
immediately i was in heaven i was not
05:12
standing in front of the fireplace i
05:14
had been dusting the mantle he'd catch
05:16
me up
05:17
took me into heaven and i was walking
05:20
behind
05:20
this young girl with strawberry blonde
05:22
hair she looked like she was about 13
05:25
and beside her was this gentleman i
05:28
didn't know who it was
05:29
and so the lord is still talking to me
05:32
all this time he said that is marissa
05:34
that is her great grandfather
05:37
now this always would amaze me but her
05:40
great-grandfather looked like he was in
05:41
his 20s
05:43
and yet here's jesus the lord of glory
05:45
telling me
05:46
that this is marissa's great-grandfather
05:49
and he's taking her to have to go have
05:52
fun somewhere
05:54
and then he kept talking and said she's
05:56
living with her great grandfather
05:57
because she's too young
05:59
to have her own mansion right now and so
06:01
he's
06:02
watching over her making sure that she
06:04
enjoys herself in heaven
06:06
and then i got and the lord said hurry
06:08
up and get closer behind him now these
06:09
people could not see me
06:11
when i'm taken to heaven nobody there
06:13
sees me the angels see me
06:15
father sinner holy spirit see me but the
06:18
people who live there do not see me in
06:19
heaven so i could hear
06:21
marissa talking saying i wish i could
06:24
see my mom i wish i could let my mom how
06:26
much
06:27
but i'm having how much i miss her when
06:29
i see her again i'm going to kiss my mom
06:32
on both cheeks
06:33
and let her know that i am a youth
06:36
leader in heaven
06:37
i wish i could really let her know that
06:40
and the whole time her
06:41
her great-grandfather was holding her by
06:42
the hand and he was smiling at her and
06:45
they kept walking and walking
06:47
she kept talking about other things and
06:49
then pretty soon i
06:50
noticed of all things
06:54
they were entering now i'm still talking
06:56
about being in heaven they were entering
06:58
into an amusement park
07:00
now this is the first time i found out
07:02
that having had an amusement park
07:05
and he started talking to her about
07:06
going on the roller coaster
07:08
and they and i could see the name even
07:11
though it was in the distance i could
07:13
see this massive roller coaster
07:15
and it was called the rush that's what
07:17
they called it was the largest roller
07:18
coaster i haven't had
07:20
people were riding on even angels were
07:22
riding on this roller coaster and that's
07:24
where he was going to take her
07:26
and so at a certain point i was taken
07:28
back down to the earth
07:30
this is a shorter version of this whole
07:32
story but i was taken back down to the
07:34
earth i was standing right in front of
07:36
the fireplace again
07:37
and he said i want marissa's mom to know
07:40
i want melody to know
07:42
that i have her daughter that she's not
07:44
missing her destiny that she still loves
07:46
her
07:47
that i have given her a position in
07:50
heaven
07:50
to be the youth leader over all the
07:53
youth in heaven and she
07:54
is she was 13 years old and so he gave
07:57
me
07:58
all this revelation about what her
08:00
daughter was doing and other things that
08:01
she had to say
08:03
and then all of a sudden i
08:06
he was done he was done sharing with me
08:09
and so
08:09
i ran and got my mom until my mom when
08:12
it happened
08:13
she was undone i was undone and so i
08:16
called the pastor's wife who had asked
08:18
us to clean this person's home
08:20
i told her what happened and she said oh
08:22
i have to give you
08:23
melody's phone number remember that's
08:26
the young girl's mother
08:27
name you must let her know this she has
08:30
missed her daughter so much that she can
08:32
hardly bear it
08:33
and she said you have to get a hold of
08:35
her and share that with her
08:37
so eventually i did call melody
08:41
and i said the same thing i did this
08:43
with everybody whenever god would catch
08:44
me up i'd see families
08:46
he would tell me the lord would usually
08:48
tell me who their family members were on
08:50
earth and sometimes
08:52
even jesus would give me their phone
08:53
number so i always knew
08:56
these people never knew who i was they
08:58
didn't know me
08:59
and of course melody did not know me
09:02
they didn't go to our church she was in
09:04
it
09:04
from a church another side of town and
09:06
so i'd always say
09:08
hello my name is give my name i think i
09:11
have some information about
09:13
your daughter well that kind of freaked
09:15
her out because
09:16
this was the like the weekend after the
09:19
little
09:19
girl's funeral like she had just buried
09:22
her
09:23
um so this was quite fresh to her and
09:26
um so i said and she said what are you
09:29
talking about and i said well your
09:30
daughter marissa
09:32
i believe i've seen her in heaven would
09:34
you like to know about it well she
09:35
didn't say
09:36
anything for a minute and then all of a
09:38
sudden she goes
09:39
i will meet you outside the mall i can
09:42
promise you
09:43
that nobody would let me come to their
09:45
home because they didn't know me they
09:46
didn't know what i was going to say
09:48
so i did meet her outside this mall on a
09:50
bench
09:51
and what i did was remember i said i
09:54
typed
09:54
all the encounter down when i had an
09:57
encounter i had typed
09:58
all the stuff down about what happened
10:00
when i was in heaven what marisa said
10:02
the places that i was shown about for
10:05
her and i
10:06
carried that with me so here's marissa's
10:08
mom sitting on this bench
10:11
with somebody who was a stranger and i
10:13
lifted up the piece of paper beginning
10:15
to read exactly what you heard
10:17
was more detail on it i read exactly
10:20
what i heard and saw
10:22
and when i put the paper down she was
10:25
shaking
10:26
she would laugh she would cry and she
10:29
looked at me and she said
10:30
i don't know you i've never seen you
10:33
before you didn't know my daughter
10:35
but you said things only my daughter
10:38
would know and she began to say the
10:41
things that confirmed what i had seen
10:44
she said every day since she was a
10:45
little girl i'd drop her off at school
10:47
she'd kiss me on both cheeks and you
10:50
said that her
10:51
her gown that she was wearing her tunic
10:53
pants and top was blue and white
10:55
blue and white were her favorite colors
10:57
you said that she was going to
10:59
cheer me on she was a cheerleader in her
11:02
school
11:03
you said that god had made her a youth
11:04
leader and that was her whole goal in
11:07
life
11:07
she said my daughter mentored kids in
11:10
her elementary school
11:12
and in her middle school she loved
11:15
people loved them no matter what they
11:16
looked like even if they were the ones
11:18
who were cast aside she loved them
11:20
she had a heart for people and her whole
11:22
goal was to be a youth leader and now
11:24
you're telling me
11:25
she is a youth leader in heaven and she
11:28
said
11:29
i was crying out to god just today
11:32
before you call me saying god i have to
11:35
know where my daughter is
11:36
is she alone in heaven what has happened
11:39
to her
11:40
and that was the first thing you share
11:42
with me that she's living with her great
11:44
grandfather and i didn't know who that
11:46
person was even though i'd seen them in
11:48
heaven
11:48
and she said so you've answered
11:50
questions that my heart cried out for
11:53
she said but the real reason i know you
11:56
were there
11:57
was about a week before
12:01
her funeral took place i was in her room
12:03
looking through her things now remember
12:05
marissa was 13.
12:07
she said i found a journal she kept
12:10
when she was either six or seven years
12:12
old it was an assignment from
12:14
school and marissa was to write down
12:17
important things that happened
12:19
in her life for a certain period of time
12:22
and
12:23
the mother said on this one page i found
12:26
this
12:26
written by my daughter when she was
12:29
young
12:30
and marissa had written in her little
12:32
girl handwriting
12:34
uh last night i dreamed i died early and
12:37
went to heaven early
12:39
i saw my great grandfather he took me on
12:42
roller coaster rides
12:44
i saw tons of mansions and it was
12:47
amazing
12:48
but as quick as god caught me up and
12:50
showed me
12:51
he brought me back to earth now this was
12:54
absolute evidence that this was a true
12:58
encounter i had
13:00
with somebody i didn't know i knew
13:03
details because i had heard them say
13:05
them
13:06
having never met these people before it
13:08
totally stunned her mother
13:10
but her mother knew i was telling the
13:12
truth
13:13
and so that changed the whole way she
13:15
felt about heaven
13:16
i know she still missed marissa but it's
13:19
also
13:20
proof of this you will not miss your
13:22
destiny when you belong to jesus christ
13:25
when you're come to heaven you will step
13:27
into the destiny he had prepared for you
13:30
before he sent you to this earth and the
13:33
mother actually told me
13:34
i actually have i did still have the
13:37
journal
13:38
that i found that she wrote all these
13:40
things down in
13:42
and she said i want to show it to you
13:45
and i was undone now this was another
13:48
day she said come by
13:49
come by my mother's house which is the
13:52
one whose home i was cleaning
13:54
and i was shown the page in this little
13:57
school notebook
13:58
uh that her little handwriting was on
14:01
that page with those exact words so
14:03
how would i ever know that
14:06
marissa had written that and melody said
14:09
you're the only
14:10
person who knows about this no one knows
14:13
about this happening
14:14
so i know what you're saying is the
14:16
truth and those are the kind of
14:18
encounters
14:20
god gave me for over 20 years he would
14:23
catch me up and tell me things like that
14:24
about people
14:26
it's confirmation and it's actually
14:28
proof
14:29
that number one heaven is real god is
14:32
real
14:33
your destiny when you belong to jesus
14:35
christ is sealed in him
14:38
and you will live the most amazing life
14:41
in heaven
14:42
and so i love to share that encounter um
14:45
some people who actually
14:47
knew marissa knew melody over the years
14:50
because it's in my book
14:51
it's in book one that whole story is
14:55
and melody wrote a special message in
14:57
there to whoever reads the book about
14:59
how that changed her life
15:01
knowing that information about her
15:02
daughter so
15:04
that's there's amazing things in heaven
15:06
but this is the proof he's given me
15:08
so he didn't just give me an assignment
15:10
to go go talk about heaven
15:12
he's shown me those places i've been to
15:14
those places
15:15
and so i thank him all the time for
15:17
trusting me to share
15:19
truth with everybody but marissa is up
15:22
there still completing her destiny
15:24
she is the head of all the youth in
15:26
heaven they're planning their part for
15:28
the mirror supper of the lamb
15:30
and it was time to start that and so
15:34
i do need to add one thing when marissa
15:36
was a little baby
15:38
a prophetess came by their home and told
15:40
her mother melody
15:42
this child will not live a long life
15:45
but her life will impact the entire
15:48
world
15:48
and of course you know that when her
15:51
daughter died early
15:52
that thought came to her about that
15:54
prophetess letting her know that her
15:56
daughter's life would impact the whole
15:57
world
15:58
and it still does today amen
16:02
thank you so much ma'am right uh guys uh
16:05
before we get into the remaining part of
16:07
the questions i just want to introduce
16:09
you who cat is cat is the revelator
16:13
and i'm sorry i forgot about that cat is
16:15
the revelator she has been to heaven
16:17
thousands of times so in fact she lost
16:20
she stopped counting after a thousandth
16:22
time
16:22
and i have been following her since 2012
16:25
she has been a great influencer over my
16:27
life
16:28
i i consider her as my mentor
16:31
and my spiritual mother so thank you so
16:34
much man so
16:35
the next question would be right this
16:38
question i need to ask you before i
16:39
forget because i was slammed by my
16:42
uh indian friends you know because last
16:44
time i didn't ask you this question
16:46
did god speak to anything specifically
16:49
the plans that he has over our country
16:51
india
16:53
has he spoken anything to you
16:54
specifically about india
16:57
india was created to be a place of
16:59
beauty
17:00
to create a fabrics and beautiful things
17:04
to wear
17:05
it's it's supposed to be a place of
17:07
peace and there is peace there
17:08
understand
17:10
that they have gods that aren't the one
17:11
true god
17:13
but his whole plan for india was to
17:14
bring beauty
17:16
and love into this world it's like
17:19
people don't realize
17:20
whole countries sometime were created by
17:23
god for a specific purpose
17:25
and i can use this one just as an
17:27
example i know uh we're supposed to talk
17:29
about india
17:30
for instance germany everybody knows
17:32
when you hear the word germany you
17:33
usually think of hitler and all the
17:35
horrible stuff that went on
17:37
but god told me he created germany the
17:39
country of germany
17:40
was made by him to create glory for god
17:44
that people would go there to feel and
17:46
then be engulfed in the glory of god
17:48
and i had the the opportunity to
17:50
actually go and share that with them
17:52
because they're still
17:53
stuck with that picture that people have
17:56
of them
17:56
and sometimes what people think about
17:58
even a whole country
18:00
it's not what god desired it's not what
18:02
he called them to do
18:03
but i can tell you this over the next
18:06
few years
18:07
india will begin to change more and more
18:10
people in india
18:11
will be receiving jesus christ as their
18:13
savior and step into the true
18:17
destiny of india amen and i can tell you
18:20
one of the things that will happen in
18:22
india is the business the businesses it
18:25
will springfield
18:26
from those who believe in jesus christ
18:29
and you know i haven't discussed
18:30
any of this with kumar not any part of
18:33
this at all
18:34
india was also made to do big business
18:37
i mean really that's what bring a great
18:40
prosperity to the country
18:42
but it will be done through those who
18:44
live in the kingdom
18:45
follow jesus christ he'll give them
18:48
witty ideas and
18:49
inventions for things not even on the
18:51
earth at this time
18:53
so india's future that god has planned
18:56
is
18:56
great and right now what he is doing
19:00
all over the world is he is shifting
19:03
government leaders so he can then
19:06
shape that entire nation for him for god
19:10
for the god who created heaven and earth
19:12
the one whose son
19:14
came and died for the souls of everybody
19:17
and so india has a beautiful bright
19:20
future
19:20
i know other countries were called to do
19:22
technology and other stuff like that
19:25
but i can tell you india is going to
19:27
bring help
19:28
and beauty and happiness to this world
19:31
because that's what god called them to
19:33
be
19:33
it was no mistake that our president
19:37
who actually still is president yeah he
19:40
did win the election
19:42
we know it was stolen evidence is being
19:44
gathered
19:45
trump will be put right back as our
19:47
president trump reached out
19:49
to the head of europe country on purpose
19:53
to see if there's anything he could do
19:54
to help to protect india
19:56
to help be a friend to india i don't
19:59
think we have many presidents that have
20:01
done that
20:01
god planned that on purpose because
20:04
trump is one of the ones who will be
20:06
connecting with the government leaders
20:08
to shift their thinking
20:10
into a democracy into knowing jesus
20:13
christ
20:14
and so that right there is a sign to you
20:18
that this is going to happen so if you
20:20
don't know
20:21
jesus christ you need to begin to pursue
20:23
him because he will be involved
20:25
all over in india very soon
20:28
wow wow we receive it ma'am we receive
20:31
it
20:32
and i have goosebumps all over my body
20:34
thank you so much when you were talking
20:35
about the
20:36
business and the plans of god over our
20:37
country we receive it we receive it
20:39
thank you so much
20:41
right the next question is how can a
20:43
person recognize
20:45
the call of god or the gifting that
20:47
which god placed in their lives and how
20:49
can they operate in it
20:52
well i think the number one thing is to
20:55
probably discover what your gift is
20:59
now there's a difference there are
21:01
spiritual gifts
21:03
and there are natural gifts a natural
21:05
gift would be somebody
21:07
like in your country who deals with the
21:09
natural
21:10
dyes and fabrics to create beautiful
21:13
things
21:14
or a jeweler who makes beautiful designs
21:17
and jewelry
21:18
those are natural gifts it's this these
21:21
people it's their passion they love what
21:23
they do
21:24
and usually if it's your natural gift
21:26
you're really
21:27
good at it and the reason you're good at
21:30
it is because god
21:31
placed that in you before he sent you
21:34
i'm
21:34
actually a photographer i know my
21:37
my commission he gave me was to take me
21:40
back and forth to heaven
21:42
back in time forward in time that's the
21:44
commission when i get to heaven one day
21:46
i won't be doing that anymore
21:48
obviously what will i be doing i'll be a
21:51
photographer in heaven
21:52
that is my heartbeat that's what makes
21:55
me gives a great joy it's
21:56
a natural gift to do amazing photography
21:59
i tell people i'm capturing moments in
22:02
time
22:03
and so that's my passion usually
22:06
your gift is something you're passionate
22:09
about
22:09
is something you would do all the time
22:11
if you could it's something that brings
22:13
you
22:14
joy other people joy your spiritual
22:17
gifts are different
22:18
most people can develop spiritual gifts
22:21
it says all may prophesy
22:22
as a believer people know that we all
22:25
have an assignment to win the lost you
22:27
know to operate in the kingdom the
22:29
gospel of the kingdom
22:31
we all haven't uh you know we all
22:33
haven't
22:34
been commissioned by god to pray to pray
22:37
for our countries
22:38
pray for people around us pray for
22:40
people we don't even know
22:42
those are commissioned spiritual
22:44
commissions
22:45
when you get to heaven you won't be
22:47
doing any of that
22:49
nobody needs to pray for people in
22:51
heaven everyone's already saved the
22:53
sayer everyone is healed that's there
22:55
you know no one's sick in heaven
22:57
so those fivefold ministry gifts like
22:59
the pastor the teacher the prophet the
23:01
apostle
23:02
the evangelists they don't need them in
23:05
heaven because everybody's
23:06
already knows jesus christ so what will
23:09
they be doing
23:10
they all have a natural gift and
23:13
whatever that natural gift is
23:15
it could be an artist it could be a
23:16
silenced
23:18
it could be something who creates
23:19
designs even in heaven
23:22
or makes fun places in heaven to do
23:24
that's their gift
23:25
that's your natural gift the most
23:28
important you discover
23:30
is not your spiritual gift because
23:32
that's temporary that's for now
23:34
the most important thing you can do even
23:36
when your child
23:37
is young is discover the gift god put in
23:41
them
23:42
my one grandson i knew when he was two
23:44
he was a drummer
23:46
he was born with that gift all he wanted
23:49
to do was drama on everything
23:51
he is amazing now because he pursued
23:54
that his parents knew that
23:55
they pursued that and heaven guess what
23:57
he'll do he'll be a drummer
23:59
because that's the gift god put in him
24:01
so i have to say
24:03
realize what it is that you love to do
24:06
maybe it's working with flowers
24:08
or with the fabrics or jewelry maybe you
24:11
like to do architectural design
24:13
interior design maybe it's working with
24:16
animals they have all kinds of animals
24:18
in heaven
24:18
so i don't know really know a lot about
24:21
india
24:22
about i know i know it's a beautiful
24:23
place i know people love there's a lot
24:25
of peace there
24:26
but when god starts getting involved in
24:28
your country
24:29
things are going to change for you to be
24:32
so much better for you so
24:34
recognize what that passion is that you
24:37
carry inside of you
24:38
and when you get to heaven nine times
24:41
out of ten that's what you'll be doing
24:42
because there's so many things in heaven
24:44
to do
24:44
people come home maybe they're chefs
24:47
maybe they're bakers they have delicious
24:50
things to eat in heaven because those
24:51
people
24:52
when they go home they'll get a bakery
24:54
they'll have some some way to produce
24:56
stuff
24:56
everybody gets to enjoy those things so
24:59
i have to say
25:00
ask god to show you if you don't know
25:03
but usually it's the thing that you love
25:04
to do the most
25:06
inside and then there then you pursue
25:08
that
25:10
yes thank you so much right uh
25:13
ma'am uh i heard you uh
25:16
once talking to steve schultz on that uh
25:19
on the interview on the studio and you
25:22
were explaining about
25:23
uh uh exodus 33 23
25:27
because man uh man gives the
25:29
interpretation of the scripture
25:31
but you don't give the interpretation
25:33
you tell us what exactly
25:34
god means when he put that scripture
25:36
over there can you give us the clarity
25:38
on uh on
25:39
when god said i will show you the hindu
25:42
parts
25:43
to moses what did he really mean by that
25:46
yes see what he gives me is revelation
25:49
not
25:49
man's information that way that's what
25:51
you just said
25:52
most people read the bible and they they
25:55
take into their head as information
25:58
but god says there's mysteries hidden in
26:00
the word
26:01
and what that means is what he actually
26:04
meant by that scripture
26:06
and so what he was really saying to
26:07
moses he said that because he was his
26:10
friend he called moses his friend
26:12
he said i'll stick you i'll put you in
26:13
the cleft of the rock
26:16
and when i pass by i will show you
26:19
my hinder parts the hinder parts that's
26:21
the scripture you're talking about
26:22
correct yes
26:24
what he was saying is i will take you
26:27
and
26:27
hide you in myself
26:30
and as that passes as things pass by
26:34
inside of me i will show you time
26:37
i will show you the parts of time that
26:39
are behind me
26:40
the hinder parts aren't talking about
26:42
his physical body
26:43
they're talking about all the time that
26:45
passed behind god
26:47
in other words what happened before
26:49
moses was born
26:50
because moses had to write the book of
26:53
genesis
26:54
how would he know about adam and eve how
26:57
would he know about the top
26:58
how would he know about all those things
27:00
how would he know about noah
27:01
i'll tell you why because when he took
27:03
him and put him inside he
27:04
saw all those things happening
27:08
so when god brought him back out he was
27:11
able to write that
27:12
whole book of genesis because he saw the
27:15
things that
27:16
actually happened so when god said the
27:18
hinder parts he meant the parts
27:21
behind me or the time that has passed
27:24
by and so that's the difference in
27:27
thinking
27:28
god put him in a rock so when he passed
27:30
by he wouldn't die
27:32
that's not what he said that's not what
27:34
he said
27:35
we know that jesus is the rock isn't
27:37
that what it says
27:38
he's the rock of our salvation so that's
27:40
what that actually meant
27:42
god showed him time he showed him the
27:45
past
27:45
so he could actually write the book of
27:47
genesis
27:49
yes thank you all right can you please
27:52
uh
27:52
talk about the armies of the heaven and
27:54
their assignment here on the earth
27:56
and how do we make use of the host
28:01
you know the hosts have always existed i
28:03
tell people
28:04
angels have a history we don't have
28:08
they were with god and they were
28:09
operating with god before he made this
28:12
world at one point there was only god's
28:16
house
28:16
god's house is a world called heaven
28:19
it's not a building
28:20
and in this massive beautiful world
28:24
tribes of angels were created there was
28:26
the father there was a son there was
28:28
holy spirit
28:29
there was melchizedek there was the
28:31
living creatures
28:32
and god had made this place where his
28:34
throne was
28:36
and then he decided to create beings who
28:39
could
28:39
help assist watch over heaven care for
28:42
the creatures care for the beautiful
28:44
things in heaven he had made
28:46
so he began to make tribes of angels
28:49
some tribes
28:50
were different tribes this is all of
28:52
them some were put
28:54
under michael some were put under
28:56
gabriel
28:57
and even a third were put under um
29:00
lucifer
29:01
lucifer was over one-third of the angels
29:04
he was the angel who was in charge of
29:05
all worship
29:07
so the worship angels were put under
29:09
lucifer
29:10
all of the army in heaven that god made
29:14
he didn't make an army to protect heaven
29:16
he was there
29:18
he holds the air we breathe everything
29:21
that was made he
29:22
spoke into existence and the word would
29:24
step out of him and make that
29:26
so they didn't need to be protected why
29:28
would he have an army
29:30
this is even before the world was made
29:32
he made this army
29:33
and all they would do would they would
29:34
be doing maneuvers which means
29:36
practice they practice warring practice
29:39
fighting
29:40
they didn't even have an enemy but see
29:41
god was preparing for the future
29:44
so that army was put under michael who
29:46
was an archangel
29:48
then all the worker angels in heaven
29:50
couriers
29:51
career angels scribes messenger angels
29:56
they were all under gabriel
29:59
even our guardian angels are under
30:02
gabriel
30:03
our guardian angels mostly look like us
30:06
they have wings sometimes they hide
30:08
their wings but the army of heaven
30:11
was made for one purpose that was to
30:14
fight
30:14
the army of darkness the wicked evil
30:18
demonic means that would eventually when
30:21
lucifer
30:22
tried to take over heaven he was kicked
30:25
out
30:25
all one-third of the angels were kicked
30:27
out and they
30:29
decided they were going to try to take
30:30
over the earth which isn't going to
30:32
happen
30:33
and so god designed this army
30:37
to fight against them most of heaven's
30:39
army look like creatures
30:41
they don't look like humans some of them
30:43
have weapons
30:44
built into them like lightning bolts or
30:47
lightning staffs
30:49
some of them they fly with the wings
30:51
made of light or made of energy
30:54
some of them have eight eyes they're
30:56
made so that they can see the enemy at
30:57
all times
30:59
they didn't know who the enemy was until
31:01
lucifer decided he was going to take
31:03
over god's throne
31:04
and take over heaven at that time they
31:07
knew who their enemy would become
31:10
so this army got designed to fight
31:13
for us that's why they were made
31:16
to fight on our behalf to help defend us
31:19
when god began to use them was when
31:22
israel was created by god
31:24
and god chose israel to represent him he
31:27
was the god of israel
31:29
israel was the one nation that believed
31:31
in the one true god that would be the
31:32
father
31:33
and so they followed what his what he
31:36
had laid down
31:37
as laws to follow guidelines to follow
31:41
they worshipped him as the one true god
31:44
and when they would get in trouble when
31:45
evil
31:46
armies on the earth would try to attack
31:48
them god would send the army of heaven
31:50
himself
31:51
to fight these humans that were wicked
31:54
on the earth
31:55
and and then they would go back to
31:56
heaven that's what they do they go
31:58
war then they go back to heaven some of
32:01
their
32:02
some of them are 100 feet high some are
32:04
even higher than that
32:05
the bible talks about the army of heaven
32:08
several times
32:09
i know that it's mentioned in particular
32:12
in isaiah 13
32:14
where it talks about israel cried out
32:16
they were being attacked that israel
32:17
cried out to god
32:18
it said god went to the far corners of
32:21
heaven to the far ends of heaven
32:24
and sent michael who is the captain of
32:26
the army to gather the army to go and
32:29
fight on behalf of israel it actually
32:31
says it in the bible
32:32
as proof that this is actually what they
32:34
did and so
32:35
i do know i've been to heaven heaven is
32:38
a world
32:40
so you would say maybe at the top part
32:41
of heaven would be
32:43
the beautiful city of god the river of
32:45
life that's where the throne room is
32:48
that's where all these beautiful things
32:50
are but michael's headquarters
32:52
i keep telling people this is at the far
32:55
ends of heaven that's where they are
32:57
they have a lot of activity going on
32:59
sending angels down to the earth to
33:01
fight on behalf of us
33:02
or different countries so they're a
33:04
whole different group that god designed
33:07
to war and there's a scripture in the
33:10
bible that says
33:11
our weapons are not natural they are not
33:15
physical
33:15
they are spiritual they are mighty to
33:19
the pulling downs of strongholds the
33:21
strongholds would be of darkness
33:24
guess what that weapon right there is
33:26
talking about
33:28
is the army of heaven that's what they
33:29
were designed for
33:31
but as of a certain time on the earth
33:34
god
33:34
had desired at one point
33:37
to let the believers have part of that
33:41
army on the earth be assigned to them
33:43
and they then would command the army
33:46
not to fight against humans but to go
33:49
out and pull down all the strongholds of
33:51
evil spiritual beings pull them down
33:54
shred the platforms they're ruling from
33:57
come against them
33:58
crush their plans of darkness and push
34:00
them back out of the way
34:02
and so now in this time we're in that's
34:04
the time that we're in we're now in the
34:06
kingdom age
34:07
that's what god calls it when the
34:09
believers will stand up
34:11
and manifest and demonstrate with their
34:14
own lives
34:15
the power of the god who created us
34:18
who sent his son to die for us it is
34:21
actually our job
34:23
part of our assignment is to command the
34:26
army
34:27
now if you're living in sin they won't
34:30
listen to you
34:31
if you're being hateful to people
34:34
they're not going to listen to you
34:36
it says that the army of heaven hearkens
34:38
unto the word of the lord
34:40
that means you better be speaking life
34:42
out of your mouth and not hate
34:44
you better be having bringing joy and
34:47
blessing to people
34:48
with what you're saying because if
34:50
you're not this army
34:51
in other words somebody can't just say i
34:53
want an army from heaven
34:54
and send them to destroy their neighbor
34:56
they don't like their neighbor send them
34:58
over here to destroy this
35:00
that isn't they're not going to listen
35:01
to that they're here
35:03
to pull down evil wicked plans of the
35:06
devil
35:08
against people it's a spiritual war
35:11
it's a spiritual weapon and only those
35:14
who are followers of jesus christ
35:16
have the right to do that it's very
35:19
significant to understand this
35:21
because in the days we're in now and
35:24
even the greater days of glory
35:26
we will send that army ahead of us
35:28
wherever we go to
35:30
protect us so this army that is sent
35:33
is sent to protect you your family your
35:36
property
35:38
places you go the area live in the city
35:41
the state if i'm talking about america
35:44
and if this was happening in india
35:46
wherever you knew evil was going on
35:48
let's say evil practices were going on
35:50
and people were doing these evil
35:52
practices
35:53
and you had this army from heaven you
35:55
would say these words i take power
35:58
over all the power of the enemy in a
36:00
certain city
36:01
and i i come in the army of having to go
36:04
and pull down the strongholds of evil
36:06
that are bringing let's say thieves or
36:09
murderers into the city
36:11
we command the host of heaven to hold on
36:13
every single demon that's empowering
36:15
those people to murder
36:17
empowering them to be evil shred the
36:20
platforms they're operating from
36:21
that pushes back the darkness that
36:23
strips away the power of evil they're
36:26
operating in so they will
36:27
these plans will fall to the ground fear
36:30
will fall upon the evil
36:32
humans doing it and that's how you can
36:35
impact your city
36:36
whether it's thieves robbers whether
36:38
it's human trafficking whatever's
36:40
involved in it
36:41
that army from heaven takes orders from
36:45
us and i'll tell you why jesus christ
36:48
said i give you he didn't say this to
36:52
the angels he said it to the believers i
36:54
give you
36:54
power over all the power of the enemy
36:57
that would be satan no matter what what
37:00
for what reason he's doing it no matter
37:02
what evil it is
37:04
we as believers have power over all of
37:06
those things going on
37:08
and that's why we can send the army of
37:10
heaven
37:11
to deal with all the wickedness and the
37:13
evil concerning those things
37:15
and that changes what goes on in this
37:17
physical world
37:19
yes thank you so much all right
37:22
this one is a kind of funny and
37:24
interesting question
37:26
because i grew up you know uh i grew up
37:29
in where people used to uh you know say
37:32
these things and
37:34
what do you think about this saying
37:36
don't be off so heavenly
37:38
that you will be of no earthly use
37:42
you write about humans saying it because
37:44
god never said that
37:46
yes yes i grew up like that i i used to
37:48
hear people saying like that so
37:51
what is your take on i heard people say
37:54
in the church that you you think too
37:56
much about heaven you can't help anybody
37:58
on the earth
37:59
it's just the opposite
38:03
god actually said think on things
38:06
above he's talking about heaven think
38:08
about how
38:09
life is there think about how heaven
38:11
operates
38:12
that's how we need to live our life on
38:14
the earth the more you
38:16
know god the more you know jesus christ
38:18
the more you know holy spirit than
38:20
the way you know heaven operates you
38:23
yourself
38:24
then have a vision of how to bring it to
38:26
this earth and how
38:27
you live on the earth will reflect the
38:30
way they have life in heaven
38:32
and so actually what they're saying is
38:34
the total opposite
38:36
you can never be too heavenly minded if
38:39
anyone was heavily minded that would
38:41
certainly include me
38:42
i think about it all day long i live my
38:45
life according to the way they live in
38:47
heaven
38:47
and it's through revelation of what the
38:49
father says about it how
38:51
we are to live our own lives on the
38:53
earth we help people
38:55
we don't harm people right we share our
38:58
blessings with people
38:59
we don't hoard things to ourselves we
39:02
think of
39:02
others more highly than ourselves
39:06
we leave the love of god the life of god
39:09
wherever we go
39:10
we share truth which is one of the most
39:13
important things this world reads not or
39:15
needs right now
39:16
they need truth so if you represent
39:19
god if you're a believer you can't just
39:23
share truth you have to live it so that
39:26
scripture
39:26
is totally wrong you can never be too
39:30
heavenly minded
39:32
that's correct thank you so much uh kat
39:34
what times are we in right now
39:36
uh because the bible says that these are
39:39
the parallettes perilous times
39:40
or the ending days as mentioned in the
39:42
bible so what times we are in right now
39:44
are these the perilous times the
39:45
dangerous times or we are in the days of
39:48
glory
39:49
we are in the days of glory and this is
39:52
the way the holy spirit says it to me
39:54
the day of his wrath which would be the
39:57
perilous times the tribulation
39:59
there's going to be the days of his
40:00
wealth but there's the days of his power
40:03
the day of his power cannot exist
40:07
in the day of his wrath the day of his
40:10
power is us demonstrating who he
40:12
is operating in supernatural signs and
40:15
wonders
40:16
above what any human could do and that's
40:19
where we're in right now we're in the
40:20
day of his power
40:22
we're in the greater days of glory when
40:24
the glory of god will cover the earth
40:27
that's the power of god most people
40:29
don't even know what the glory is
40:30
the glory is the power in the light of
40:32
god
40:33
operating in us as believers and us
40:37
taking not just talking about it around
40:39
the earth but demonstrating his power
40:42
like stopping an earthquake and making
40:44
it put it back the way it was before it
40:46
came
40:47
uh not just walking on water but walking
40:49
on air
40:50
the greater works haven't even happened
40:52
yet so i can tell you why
40:54
this is not the parents times and the
40:57
parents times people will be
40:59
hoping to still be alive when night time
41:02
comes
41:03
they hope they'll still be alive when
41:05
daytime comes they'll be living in all
41:06
kinds of places not even homes
41:09
there won't be homes left anymore
41:11
they'll be hearty food
41:12
we're not anywhere near we're probably
41:14
several hundred years away from that
41:16
we are now entering into greatness to be
41:20
great for god
41:21
to speak to the land the sea and the air
41:24
as sons and daughters of god to shift
41:26
things and
41:27
change things in this world the wealth
41:30
is going to be given to the just and the
41:31
righteous that hasn't happened
41:34
um we're still not doing the greater
41:36
works we're not even doing the works
41:37
that christ did not fully
41:39
so this couldn't possibly be the
41:42
perilous times
41:43
it is the days of the glory of god going
41:47
around this world
41:48
it is the days of the manifested sons
41:51
and daughters of walking on the earth
41:53
those are strong believers who have
41:54
great faith
41:56
that will do what god asks us to do and
41:58
what those things will be will be
42:00
for to change things for the better
42:03
not the darkness so these are not days
42:06
that are going deeper and deeper into
42:08
darkness i know people look around and
42:10
see what's going on in the world even in
42:12
our country
42:13
i know what's going on in our country
42:15
god
42:16
himself is exposing evil everywhere
42:20
not just in america he's exposing it in
42:23
india
42:24
in in italy all over this world
42:27
el salvador i could just go on venezuela
42:30
all these countries of the world
42:32
god's exposing wicked people
42:35
doing evil things why so he can remove
42:39
them
42:39
so they can be brought to justice why is
42:42
he doing that
42:43
so we will have freedom and liberty to
42:46
operate however we need to for god
42:48
with no interference with wicked
42:50
governments wicked people
42:52
controlling the airwaves controlling the
42:54
news putting
42:55
lies out so people won't know what's
42:57
going on it's
42:59
changing this is necessary let me tell
43:02
you another reason why
43:03
god has so many new inventions that he
43:06
wants to put on the earth
43:07
but he won't do it when evil
43:10
people are trying to take over
43:13
so this is a sign to me from what god is
43:16
saying to me
43:17
i will remove the evil people i remove
43:21
the injustice and i will make the path
43:23
clear and wide for the sons and
43:26
daughters of god
43:27
to do whatever he has them do create new
43:30
things that are have never been on the
43:32
earth before
43:33
they will make life better for people
43:35
give us sources of fuel we don't have on
43:38
the earth
43:39
creating new ways of transportation all
43:41
kinds of new things
43:43
not just here in america but all over
43:44
the world that will help make
43:46
the earth itself better and if god
43:50
can't remove the evil he can't send the
43:53
inventions
43:54
so i promise you he is going to change
43:58
it
43:58
that's what's happening right now
44:00
evidence is being gathered
44:01
all over the world especially by people
44:04
right here brilliant people in america
44:07
uh militaries who belong and operate
44:10
under the power of god and great leaders
44:14
are getting
44:14
ready to do something powerful and it is
44:18
going to change for the good
44:20
amen so guys we have the confirmation
44:22
that these
44:23
are not the days of doom and gloom these
44:25
are the days of glory
44:26
so take authority and uh start
44:29
demonstrating the kingdom of god
44:30
by declarations by doing the declaration
44:33
how many minutes do i have man
44:35
i don't want to you know take much
44:38
time of yours
44:43
i'm supposed to have maybe i think maybe
44:47
it's what i have two minutes
44:52
all right so a couple of important
44:55
questions
44:56
uh the other day i heard you are talking
44:58
on the shows you shall so
45:00
you were explaining about the scripture
45:02
many have sinned
45:04
and come short of the glory of god how
45:06
do you respond to that can
45:08
you can you explain this it's
45:11
not what people think again they don't
45:13
have revelation on that
45:15
and people will say that all the time
45:17
you know we're all sinners the bible
45:19
says so
45:20
that's not saying we're all sinners what
45:22
that scripture is talking about is god
45:24
is saying
45:25
you have come short of
45:28
caring the glory of god demonstrated the
45:31
glory of god
45:32
pursuing the glory of god the glory of
45:34
god is something we create with our
45:36
lives and the way we live it
45:38
it produces light literally light begins
45:41
to come from us because we're producing
45:43
glory
45:44
that glory can be very damaging to the
45:47
things that hell has planned
45:48
we're supposed to carry it and release
45:50
it wherever we go it
45:52
literally crushes the darkness it
45:54
crushes the evil plans of satan
45:56
and we're not doing it and believers
45:59
don't pursue it
46:00
they think they're just an old sinner
46:01
say by grace stop saying that
46:03
okay you're not an old sinner anymore if
46:05
you got born again you're a new creation
46:07
you've been blessed with the power of
46:09
god christ gives us power over all the
46:11
power of the enemy
46:12
what we speak and say shifts and changes
46:15
things uh
46:16
it creates atmospheres around us in
46:18
whole cities
46:19
and what the where we come short is
46:22
we're not doing it
46:24
okay we're not told that or explained
46:26
that in church
46:27
you get saved and eventually you make it
46:29
to heaven that's all they say
46:31
there's so much more we're supposed to
46:32
be doing so that scripture
46:35
isn't saying you're all sinners okay
46:37
when you're born again
46:38
you're not a sinner unless you start
46:40
sinning again if you
46:42
sin repent for doing that jesus will
46:45
restore your righteousness
46:47
but we're just trying to barely survive
46:50
that's the mode that everyone's been
46:51
given you're supposed to be way beyond
46:53
that
46:54
that's where we fall short that's why he
46:57
wants us to know who he is and what
46:59
we've been given so we can operate in
47:02
it final question ma'am uh
47:05
kingdom of god suffers violence and the
47:08
violence
47:09
it by force please respond to this
47:13
that is an awesome scripture that i was
47:15
taught in person about that
47:18
and uh i i didn't understand that
47:20
scripture for
47:21
for some time and then the holy spirit
47:23
actually came to me and said i'm going
47:25
to show you exactly what that scripture
47:26
means
47:27
but if you look in other interpretations
47:29
of the bible on that scripture
47:31
this is what people people interpret
47:33
that scripture say
47:35
people are running into heaven and
47:36
attacking it now that's crazy
47:39
people are going into heaven and
47:40
stealing things i mean from the
47:42
earth people are doing that that's how
47:44
they interpret it this is the real
47:46
interpretation
47:47
from the time of john the baptist until
47:50
now
47:52
god stirs up spiritual
47:55
violence and passion on the inside of
47:57
the believer
47:59
so they then can take things by force
48:02
away from satan that's what he means
48:05
when he says the violent
48:07
that's that passion in you the power of
48:10
god in you
48:11
you take by force things that enemy had
48:13
stolen from you
48:15
stolen from different cities we it's our
48:18
it's our uh pleasure and our honor to do
48:21
that for god
48:22
and so people this is how he interpreted
48:24
he said that doesn't mean that people
48:26
are being tortured
48:28
he's not talking about people running
48:29
into heaven that's not what that means
48:31
it says it's when it says it suffers
48:35
violence
48:36
means it stirs up violence it causes
48:39
this passion to rise up
48:42
and the holy spirit said i'm going to
48:43
give you another scripture with the word
48:45
suppers in it
48:46
when jesus said to his disciples
48:49
suffer the little children to come unto
48:51
me
48:52
that means cause the little children to
48:54
come into me
48:55
stir up the little children to come unto
48:57
me make a way for them to come into me
49:00
that word suffers where it says the the
49:03
kingdom of heaven
49:04
suffers violence doesn't mean it's under
49:06
attack it means it's stirring up in
49:08
us that passionate power of god
49:12
to take back from the enemy the things
49:15
he stole from us
49:16
yes thank you so much ma'am thank you so
49:18

03:16
thousand times
03:18
wow i i don't know anybody like that one
03:20
but
03:21
the scenario of it is god has brought
03:24
her in our generation
03:26
in our generation and you know now i
03:29
don't know if cathcart had a chance to
03:31
watch us
03:32
on elijah list we got a lot of
03:35
response from elijah list you know and
03:38
and
03:38
so i'm gonna give her let her know and i
03:40
give her this in about a few minutes
03:42
okay the lord took me to time travel
03:44
catker
03:46
to the rapture generation which wasn't
03:49
ours
03:49
it wasn't ours the lord made that very
03:53
clear to me
03:54
he said this is not our generation
03:58
he didn't tell me the generation it was
04:00
he says i'm gonna allow you to
04:01
experience what it would be like to be
04:04
raptured but it's not your generation
04:07
he made that so clear so clear
04:11
and i was good i was okay with that so i
04:13
was able to talk about it
04:15
on elijah list and since i have a
04:18
pastoral anointing
04:20
the lord downloaded and reminded me of
04:23
scriptures
04:24
proving that this was not the generation
04:28
so all that explained yesterday a
04:31
whole lot of things got cleared up
04:34
yesterday praise
04:35
god you know
04:38
if it's going to happen yes it's going
04:41
to happen no
04:42
right now no god this is harvest time
04:45
saints
04:45
harvest time harvest time beyond measure
04:49
and cat curry tell us right now give us
04:51
an update
04:52
what's going on in heaven regarding our
04:55
nation and globally
04:56
it's yours well i can tell you that
05:00
heaven has been excited for quite a
05:02
while now
05:03
because they understand the big picture
05:06
of what's actually happening a lot of
05:09
people don't know what's happening or
05:10
they think it's something that it's not
05:13
a lot of people think these are horrible
05:15
times desperate times and you're right
05:17
some people actually think this is the
05:19
perilous times well i've seen
05:20
some of the perilous times but let me
05:22
tell you it's not now it's not for now
05:25
that is a long ways away just like you
05:27
said we're not in the generation
05:29
even that will experience any of those
05:31
things why because there's so many
05:33
things that hasn't happened yet
05:35
and i'm telling people there's six
05:36
scriptures really that show you and i'm
05:38
sure you've got them so i'm not going to
05:40
quote them
05:41
that god clearly explains what still has
05:44
to happen
05:45
and now i say the number one out of all
05:48
of those scriptures that will prove it's
05:50
not time to get on your rapture up and
05:52
take off
05:53
is the fact that it says the world will
05:56
know
05:56
us the body of christ but guess what
05:59
our love for each other and boy
06:02
that is not happening is it manuel
06:05
that's right that's right
06:07
that's right god's coming for for a
06:10
fearless church not a fearful church
06:12
saying you're right understand that
06:14
alrighty there's so many
06:16
genera there are so many people that
06:18
have not been born yet
06:19
that means and is going to experience a
06:22
love of god
06:24
some of them are not even here are they
06:26
man well that are going to be great
06:28
leaders in the body of christ for
06:29
several generations so
06:31
we can't end all this and we can't say
06:34
certainly
06:34
not going to say god is because i know
06:36
he absolutely is not ending anything
06:39
and he's the only one that knows when
06:42
that rapture will happen
06:43
doesn't he he's the only one
06:46
and i can tell you we got to have the
06:48
wealth transfer we got to have the
06:50
greater works
06:51
we're still looking for people to do the
06:53
works that christ did
06:55
but there's greater works even than
06:56
those that have to happen
06:58
the manifested sons and daughters will
07:00
actually stand up and speak to the land
07:02
the sea in the sky and it will obey
07:04
what we say because that's god's plan
07:07
when christ died he gave us authority to
07:09
be over all the darkness
07:11
so what's actually happening right now
07:14
is god is exposing
07:16
how deep how dark it is and it will
07:19
explain you why
07:21
there's brand new witty ideas and
07:23
inventions that haven't been put on the
07:24
earth and he won't allow them to be on
07:26
the earth
07:27
because the wicked would steal them
07:29
until he wipes this whole platform clean
07:32
of wickedness of corruption of
07:34
defilement
07:35
so all the things you hear coming from
07:37
our capital
07:39
that is going to be wiped clean like it
07:41
never happened
07:42
god will reestablish the one who
07:45
actually won the election his name is
07:46
donald j
07:47
trump at this moment as i speak he
07:49
actually is our president and guess what
07:51
he knows that
07:53
god has to clean this platform not just
07:56
here in america
07:57
this is about the world we're talking
07:59
about and we know it manuel and i know
08:01
it steve schultz knows that
08:03
hank a lot of us know that this is not
08:05
the end
08:06
because the greatest days have not even
08:09
come to the earth yet
08:10
if you're alive now it's because he
08:12
purposed you he timed your birth on the
08:15
earth
08:16
to not just watch time go by but be a
08:19
part of the great things he wants to
08:21
have
08:21
happen the father wants to have happen
08:23
the lord wants it the holy spirit wants
08:25
it
08:25
the army of heaven is just waiting ready
08:29
to show up and show off and you'd be so
08:32
shocked to see
08:33
how many people were in that corruption
08:35
i love to shake my key this is the key
08:37
of time right here
08:38
and i left say that because i do know
08:41
i've also been taken forward i also
08:43
agree with manuel
08:45
when he was taken into the future that
08:47
has happened many many times i've even
08:49
had glimpses of the new earth
08:51
he's taken me back in time and i saw
08:54
heaven before he even made the earth so
08:57
nobody can tell me
08:59
that can't happen you're actually there
09:02
he takes you there
09:03
it's not a dream it's not a vision so i
09:05
understand why manuel is so passionate
09:07
nobody can take that away from you
09:09
it literally happened and god does it
09:12
to show things to us so i'm excited for
09:15
men well i'm sure we'll have more
09:17
encounters like that
09:18
and i think other people will begin to
09:20
have encounters but god is cleaning up
09:23
this earth okay i know he can't take it
09:25
all the way
09:26
because we know that other things have
09:28
to come
09:30
but these days we're entering into will
09:31
be so powerful
09:33
this is what the father said in eternity
09:37
people will sing in glorious celebration
09:41
about these days we're in right now and
09:44
probably the next i don't know
09:45
20 40 years more more more powerful
09:48
things will happen
09:50
and this earth will look different and i
09:52
know people have been taking a hundred
09:54
years into the future it was different
09:55
but even a hundred years away
09:57
the tribulation had not come yet because
09:59
too many things had
10:00
happened first so hang on that's all i
10:03
can say hang on and rejoice
10:05
because no one will stop god from having
10:07
his way
10:08
can they they can't do that can they man
10:10
well he's going to have his way
10:12
that's right that's right saints first
10:15
of all you have to understand just like
10:16
kat kerr was saying
10:17
god loves you and and you know we all
10:20
know about
10:21
jeremiah the scripture which says you
10:23
know his plans and thoughts for us is
10:24
good
10:25
that's right we've been seeing a lot of
10:28
darkness but there's a pushback that's
10:31
happening
10:33
it is a pushback okay the uh uh
10:37
we then you see the garbage on the media
10:39
i caught a pack calculator i'll call
10:40
them the media knights that's what they
10:42
are
10:44
yeah why
10:47
but listen you're gonna see a push back
10:50
when you read the scriptures
10:51
it makes it very clear in the scriptures
10:54
you know when
10:55
when you see cinnabon grace abound
10:57
there's a move that are happening behind
10:59
the scenes
11:00
that a lot of christians don't see
11:03
because they
11:04
yeah they glue their ears and their eyes
11:06
to the media
11:08
you can't do that scene is your soul
11:12
i don't even watch it you probably don't
11:14
watch it either do you mind i don't
11:15
i don't watch the fake news i i i don't
11:18
watch it because
11:19
it's not food for your soul it's not
11:23
for your soul says the presence of god
11:25
the the
11:26
the word of god which you're watching
11:28
right now
11:29
us this broadcast this is food for your
11:31
soul yes
11:33
like i told you we know we know the
11:36
truth
11:37
we know the truth and i said this uh
11:39
also on elijah list
11:40
okay prophets uh seers
11:43
we get the truth before the before the
11:47
the false truth we're gonna get the
11:49
truth the lord said it is the truth that
11:51
makes you free
11:52
that's right not afford in our ministry
11:56
not just our ministry in my marriage in
11:59
my relationship
12:00
i cannot afford to be to allow
12:04
things that's going to poison my soul
12:07
and it's going to
12:09
take me and and and seduce my mind
12:12
to to uh wavering because i do not want
12:15
to be unstable in my walk with god
12:19
you know uh it's not good saints now
12:22
the total decision is up to you that
12:24
that are watching
12:26
but you have to make a decision who are
12:28
you going to
12:29
serve who are you going there's the
12:32
world
12:33
and there's the lord okay and now i'm
12:36
saying this and i know kepker agrees
12:38
because she's afraid
12:39
as for me and my household we will serve
12:42
the lord
12:43
that's right the lord means you got to
12:45
make decisions every day
12:47
was coming into your ears was coming
12:49
through your eyes
12:50
was coming into your soul you got to
12:52
make the food
12:53
every single day god has given you and i
12:57
to be the light
12:58
the light of the world we are for jesus
13:02
he
13:03
he funnels his light through us we are
13:05
the salt
13:06
we flavor the world with the word of god
13:09
you and i
13:10
are salt thank you you've got to
13:13
understand that cat carry
13:14
you can interrupt me any time
13:18
i know it's so exciting when you know
13:20
the truth you know and you want everyone
13:22
to know and to see it
13:23
but you're right i know people
13:25
personally
13:26
who begin to watch that fake news
13:29
probably back around 2016
13:31
and have fed on it continually and
13:35
they're not even the same people
13:37
they they can't even understand what
13:39
truth is all they want
13:40
all they can repeat is what is in your
13:42
soul
13:43
as a man thinketh in his heart that's
13:46
your soul
13:47
that's what you will become so what you
13:49
feel in there
13:50
your soul has layers what you what goes
13:53
in there
13:53
what you hear goes in there what you say
13:55
yourself goes in there
13:57
and so if all you're feeding on is the
13:59
darkness the doom the gloom
14:01
and the lies guess what's going to come
14:03
out of you those very things
14:06
and so god didn't give me a way to help
14:08
people truly i don't have time to go
14:10
through all of it literally you make a
14:11
decision if you don't want to think that
14:13
way anymore
14:14
that everything's ending and there's
14:16
nothing but hate and everybody hates one
14:18
another and the world's coming to an
14:19
end you need to say i choose my will to
14:22
lose
14:23
all of the lies all of the deception all
14:26
the hateful words the deceiving words
14:28
i listen to defilement i won't keep it
14:31
in my soul in jesus name
14:32
jesus will come and pull it out of you
14:35
you need to be
14:36
free or you won't even be able to be
14:39
prepared for what god is bringing to
14:41
this earth which is greatness
14:43
power is carrying the glory is baptism
14:46
in
14:47
fire think on those things that's what's
14:49
coming
14:50
these are such powerful days we're
14:52
living in that's what's coming and i'm
14:54
seeing each one of those happening
14:56
on the earth and i'm telling you you
14:58
won't be the same
14:59
this world won't be the same when the
15:01
knowledge of the glory of god which is
15:03
the power
15:04
and the presence of god being carried by
15:07
those
15:08
who prepare to carry it we carry the
15:10
glory we take it around the world that's
15:12
what the scripture says the knowledge of
15:14
the knowing of the glory
15:15
will cover the earth like the waters
15:16
cover the sea that's us taking
15:18
it let me tell you the impact that
15:20
begins to happen when that gets released
15:22
in places
15:23
it's like shock waves going through the
15:25
spirit realm that crushes the darkness
15:27
that removes lies it removes pain that
15:30
removes all kinds of things
15:31
why would we want to skip that time
15:34
we're not going to all right i've signed
15:36
up for whatever god wants when he wants
15:38
it and the way he wants
15:40
it if you can't pray anything else you
15:42
need to say god i want
15:43
your will your way not mine
15:47
not man's because when you start talking
15:50
like that
15:51
freedom will be able to come to you you
15:53
know we can have people come in and
15:55
change things
15:56
but if your soul is not free from all
15:59
that darkness you've been taken in
16:00
you're not really going to be free
16:02
we want you to be free when you fill
16:04
with celebration
16:06
and joy that's what should be coming out
16:07
of you right now hope
16:09
life celebration joy and the power of
16:12
god is
16:13
what needs to be coming from us at this
16:15
time on the earth
16:18
saints i do receive that i receive that
16:21
god has a major plan
16:22
for our nation and globally yeah
16:26
many of you heard us listen there's two
16:29
things and i said this on elijah list
16:31
yesterday on cat girl
16:32
there's two major things that are
16:34
standing in the way
16:36
of satan's plans that is the church and
16:39
the united states
16:41
okay because we get the gospel out
16:44
saints
16:45
we get already over 90
16:48
of the gospel comes from the united
16:50
states 24
16:52
7. that's right that is that is a major
16:55
headache for the devil
16:57
it sure is yes it's a major headache for
17:01
the devil
17:02
and i tell people all the time he the
17:05
devil
17:06
made a big mistake when he thought he
17:08
could come in and take over right now
17:10
but you know every time god does
17:12
something great in the earth the enemy
17:14
the devil
17:15
always makes an attempt to stop but
17:17
guess what
17:19
too late too that for him he's gonna
17:22
lose he's a loser he's
17:24
always lost he lost in heaven he lost in
17:26
hell by the son of god lost in heaven by
17:28
the father
17:29
guess who gets to do it now we is the
17:32
body of christ
17:33
we're the winners we're the overcomers
17:35
and satan is the loser
17:37
he's the doormat not you
17:42
saints you remember deuteronomy said
17:44
where are the heads not the tails hello
17:46
hello where are the heads not the tails
17:49
kat kur was talking about the
17:51
wealth transfer earlier you know uh
17:53
witty ideas and
17:54
and uh dreams and visions and concepts
17:57
read deuteronomy 28
17:59
read it this is where god wanted israel
18:02
to be
18:03
already he hasn't changed his mind okay
18:07
raise us up globally as a church a
18:10
strong church
18:11
not a weak church not a fearful church
18:14
uh not a a church with all spontaneous
18:16
not a hateful church a loving church
18:19
saints to love thy neighbor as thyself
18:22
okay i know i've i've heard people
18:25
christians i'm not talking about the
18:27
world culture we've heard christians
18:29
that
18:29
that say things against trump let me
18:31
explain something to you okay
18:33
every one of us had to get born again
18:35
yes every one of us
18:37
already god used nebuchadnezzar god used
18:40
king cyrus
18:41
he as he said these are my servants all
18:44
righty
18:46
so we can't go on perfection
18:49
we can't go on perfection whoever god
18:51
says he's using
18:52
he's raising up i'm i'm floyd
18:56
god will work on my heart your heart
19:00
and trump's heart but he fights for this
19:03
season
19:04
amen he's anointed and he's appointed
19:08
and when god anoints and appoints
19:10
somebody
19:11
they are not going to fail and everyone
19:13
can come against it but they will keep
19:15
standing
19:16
and i know someone else just looked at
19:18
winston churchill in world war
19:20
ii if he had not me and he was not a
19:22
believer trust me maybe he made it at
19:24
the end but
19:25
he was very strong in his language but
19:28
i'd say what else is strong against the
19:30
enemy
19:31
trying to attack england and crush them
19:34
and guess who stood up
19:36
and said no and positioned the army they
19:38
had great victory because that man for
19:40
that season was anointed and appointed
19:43
and eisenhower was one of the same
19:45
people
19:45
so in our time it's donald j trump which
19:48
he informed me of that in 2015
19:51
he's anointed and appointed let me tell
19:53
you if you don't know that already he's
19:55
not going to give up her back down
19:56
because he knows
19:57
that he is here to help america to
20:00
achieve what god wants this is the thing
20:02
he welcomes god in our nation he
20:06
recognizes jesus christ as being the
20:08
highest power
20:10
in existence today it comes that comes
20:12
from the top when that's made
20:15
these other ones who are sitting where
20:16
they're at they stole it they stole the
20:19
the true ones who won and we all know 80
20:21
million of us know who won
20:23
donald j trump in god's eyes is still
20:25
our president he won
20:27
he's anointed he's appointed he was the
20:30
one given authority to cover
20:31
our country so all these attempts that
20:34
are being made right now they will fail
20:36
god said they will become like dust
20:39
and it will be wiped away like it never
20:41
was so that's what you can look forward
20:43
to
20:44
write it in a book somewhere it's going
20:47
to happen
20:48
hallelujah you know character i'm not
20:51
sure
20:51
if you uh heard one of the broadcasts uh
20:54
that i was on
20:56
i had told steve that
20:59
god took me it wasn't a time travel this
21:01
was a vision
21:03
and he had uh took me to a vision
21:06
and i didn't see trump's face but he was
21:09
on his knees
21:11
he was on his knees i saw the back of
21:14
him
21:14
but he was on his knees things
21:17
it brought to me you know i already knew
21:20
that he was anointed and appointed for
21:23
this
21:23
seat this is his season but i never saw
21:27
that part of him
21:28
yeah and god showed me the back side of
21:31
trump he says
21:32
i want you to see this so his hands move
21:35
god's hands move
21:36
then it was it was kind of foggy and
21:38
then it cleared up and i see this man
21:41
he's on his knees the back of him i
21:44
don't know what he was praying
21:45
aha he was praying but i do know he was
21:48
seeking jesus
21:49
yeah dealing with him and i could see
21:51
god's hand on donald trump
21:54
so saints the bible makes it very clear
21:57
we have to
21:58
examine ourselves we i cannot listen to
22:01
the media
22:02
and let the media tell me what a man is
22:04
or what a woman is
22:06
i have to hear them okay you're right
22:09
about that
22:11
you and i know the scriptures because
22:13
listen this is wonderful
22:15
remember ananias god came to him in a
22:18
vision
22:19
and said hey i need you to anoint
22:22
i need you to anoint soul he's at this
22:25
place and he's praying
22:27
what did anand and i say well you know
22:29
what the fake news is saying lord
22:31
he's out there and he's massacring
22:32
everybody what the god said
22:35
he is my servant i've called him
22:38
that's right and he says i need you to
22:41
anoint him
22:42
and and you know and he's going to be
22:44
filled with the holy spirit and
22:45
he is go i'm going to use him to be
22:47
before kings
22:49
and leaders and he must know what he
22:51
must go through
22:52
for my name sake that was it
22:55
and the minute then we read on so
22:58
ananias says okay lord
23:00
that's it and then i just heard from all
23:02
these rumors about
23:04
about what soul was doing but one moment
23:07
with god that's what i'm trying to say
23:08
go before god one moment with god will
23:12
change
23:13
destiny even in your mind yes okay
23:16
and he went and the first thing he said
23:19
when he knocked on the door
23:20
read the scriptures he says brother
23:24
soul god come to me in a vision
23:29
thanks god has come to me and many of
23:33
you
23:33
that are listening know that god has
23:35
spoken to your heart
23:36
yeah what you call donald trump to do
23:38
and for you to do
23:40
what we what are we supposed to do back
23:42
him up in prayer
23:44
back him up in prayer that's what god
23:46
calls us to do
23:47
not judge his character not justice and
23:49
to back
23:50
him up in prayer we are going to see the
23:53
glory of god
23:54
not just in this nation but globally
23:56
historically we've been chosen as a
23:58
generation
23:59
to see the move of god we always hear
24:03
about it can't curve
24:04
we hear about what happened 100 years
24:06
ago in there
24:07
and in the azusa streets and all the
24:09
other things that took place
24:10
with all the powerful men of god 100
24:13
years ago 200 years ago
24:14
but now now we are part of a move
24:18
of god like the red sun that we can tell
24:21
our kids and our grandkids
24:23
got curry interrupting when you can
24:27
i don't know i know what's coming
24:29
something's coming
24:31
coming that hasn't come before in this
24:34
time that's why
24:35
the great detail in exposing the
24:38
wickedness and the evil
24:40
and god has said when the earth begins
24:43
to shake this is what he said on
24:45
november the 4th
24:46
god said this on uh on steve schultz uh
24:49
the
24:50
chat with stevie cat go back and check
24:51
out november 4th on elijah on the live
24:54
streams
24:55
god said that the fraud and the
24:58
wickedness was so great
25:00
in america but also around the world
25:02
they're conspiring to take over the
25:03
country
25:04
to go take over the presidency and to
25:06
stop what god
25:07
wants done and god the father said when
25:10
the ground begins to
25:12
shake you have no idea the hundreds of
25:14
earthquakes that have been everywhere
25:16
when the ground begins to shake watch
25:18
for the landslide of fraud to be
25:21
exposed and he said from the highest
25:23
level to the lowest it will all be
25:25
exposed
25:26
and justice will be given it will
25:29
prevail
25:30
and i will wipe it away and put the one
25:32
i chose
25:34
back in the presidency of america
25:36
because
25:37
we in this time are creating a
25:40
habitation for heaven
25:42
not just another revival not just
25:45
another awakening
25:46
we will have a habitation by god in the
25:49
earth that cannot be taken by man
25:52
cannot be stolen or changed or twisted
25:54
that's what we're being
25:56
set up right now to have is a habitation
25:59
of god
26:00
in us and it'll go around the world and
26:03
people can't control in the past if we
26:04
try to control a revival that was in a
26:06
certain area
26:07
this is about to go worldwide when god
26:10
is waiting for that to happen but
26:12
first he has to deal with the darkness
26:15
and you should be excited that we're
26:17
actually seeing the exposure happen
26:19
right now
26:22
well you can't carry you're absolutely
26:24
right saints
26:25
if you would go about four four or five
26:29
um facebook pages and i was talking
26:33
about
26:34
god's gonna send an ill spirit in the
26:36
white
26:37
house and they're going to confusion
26:42
slippery things slipping the enemy is
26:44
going to slip
26:45
up you're going to see people slipping
26:47
up slipping up slipping and falling
26:49
what what happened a few days ago that's
26:51
all i'm gonna say
26:53
okay why what the cat person
26:57
what did she say i said listen i said if
27:00
it's not anointed and it's not appointed
27:02
it won't last long
27:03
you've heard me say that in the youtubes
27:05
you've heard me say
27:06
on facebook if god has an anointing and
27:09
he hasn't appointed it it's not going to
27:11
last long
27:12
no no i said this is this
27:15
not going to last long i said so we
27:17
should sit back and enjoy the show
27:19
because yes enjoy the show and celebrate
27:23
by eating cake because
27:25
that's what the father literally said
27:27
tell everybody keep praying and
27:28
declaring
27:29
the truth to be known and to celebrate
27:32
like it's already happened and he said
27:34
we're eating cake in heaven they're
27:36
eating cake in heaven that's what
27:37
they're doing
27:38
why they're celebrating with us on the
27:40
earth that no
27:41
god is going to move his hand so
27:43
powerfully
27:44
it'll be such a shocking assembly to
27:47
people some people
27:48
i don't know if they'll recover i can
27:50
tell you that god is going to shake
27:53
things and he's going to move things
27:54
where he wants them to be
27:56
and people you can know you know you go
27:58
write it down and see it happen because
28:00
this is what god's plans are
28:02
and you know it says he won't do
28:04
anything without sharing his secrets
28:06
with his friends
28:07
the prophets come on amos come on come
28:10
on amen
28:12
saints the lord has been continually
28:15
updating
28:16
me cat kerr robin
28:19
uh johnny johnny um um
28:23
i i think there's a few more uh johnny
28:26

28:34
the lord is is ministering to this
28:37
saints he didn't leave he didn't leave
28:38
us hanging
28:39
so we're not leaving okay all righty
28:42
what does the bible tell us and and and
28:45
second chronicles
28:46
you know believe the word of god all
28:49
right
28:49
believe the word of god and you will be
28:52
established believe his prop
28:54
his prophets and you will proud
28:59
stand on that word okay stand on that
29:02
word
29:03
you have to understand something this
29:06
whole setting that you're seeing was
29:07
happening
29:08
in our nation and globally the best way
29:11
i can explain this cat curve
29:12
to the viewers it's like it's like a
29:15
parade
29:16
i live in california so every year we
29:18
have the
29:19
we have the new year's parade and
29:22
you see it's a long parade it's a long
29:25
parade
29:26
and there are seats everywhere in
29:27
pasadena so some people are seated in
29:30
the beginning
29:31
where this parade starts some people are
29:33
seated in the middle
29:35
where they're seeing and some people are
29:37
seated at the end of the parade
29:38
where everything is okay so we can't see
29:41
everything
29:42
but when you're in the helicopter those
29:44
are like god's eyes you see the
29:46
beginning to the end of the parade
29:48
you see it so i could be at the
29:50
beginning of the parade
29:52
and i could have a friend at the end and
29:55
he could tell me you know
29:56
and i'm telling him you ought to see
29:57
this float that's coming
29:59
well he hasn't seen it yet but i've seen
30:01
it because i'm at the beginning
30:03
and that's how god is with his prophets
30:05
yes
30:06
understand that some prophecies at the
30:08
beginning the middle
30:09
or the end but god sees the whole
30:11
picture he sees the whole parade
30:14
he's on top he sees everything god is
30:16
already seeing the end of this
30:19
that's right you stay strong he sees the
30:22
beginning
30:23
to the middle to the end okay he have
30:26
shown
30:26
us how it ends hallelujah saints and
30:30
then
30:31
we on the side that wins we on the side
30:33
that wins all the time
30:36
so listen if i'm going to be on any side
30:38
i'm going to be on the side that wins
30:40
why wouldn't i lose okay
30:43
all righty i'm sorry satan is a loser
30:46
he he is he falls he's a fallen
30:51
sheriff not a fallen god he's a
30:55
cherub that's it okay he's
30:59

31:01
to end up in the pit
31:02

33:21
excited about what the lord is doing
33:23
i'm so excited we this is a great time
33:26
to be
33:26
a lie
33:29
up here he says pack up your rapture
33:32
rock you guys heard me say i said return
33:34

33:35
your rapture suitcases and get your
33:37
money back
33:41
and get your crown on to rule and reign
33:43
with jesus christ
33:47
a lot of things that people have said
33:49
they want to know about justice
33:51
justice you know i i know the answer but
33:53
i want them to hear it from you
33:56
will justice be served justice will be
33:59
served that is from the mouth of the
34:01
father that's his revelation that's his
34:03
plan
34:04
and it's his will and i can tell you
34:07
i've been to heaven right
34:08
i've lost i stopped counting it a
34:10
thousand times i was caught up on
34:12
purpose
34:13
i was given a commission to be a
34:14
revelator to see heaven
34:16
and shared on the earth that's what i've
34:18
been doing since
34:21
1996 people
34:23
so it's too late to tell me that god
34:25
doesn't plan things and sometimes he
34:27
doesn't tell people dates
34:29
but if he said he's going to do it let
34:30
me tell you what he is going to do and
34:32
he's going to do it in a big way
34:34
right now and so uh i i'm going to just
34:37
stick with what god says i'm going with
34:39
what he wants
34:40
and i live in joy every day you choose
34:43
if you choose to be happy or
34:45
disillusioned or upset you know get rid
34:48
of that stuff
34:49
don't let this stuff be in you if you
34:51
belong to jesus christ
34:53
we're supposed to be just like him and i
34:56
can tell you right now
34:57
he's excited he's not in fear he's not
35:00
trembling on his throne up there
35:02
he's up there laughing at the plans of
35:04
the enemy
35:05
because he knows they're going to go
35:07
down in jesus name
35:09
and the ones who win are the ones who
35:12
are with jesus christ
35:13
right now and be in agreement with what
35:16
he wants
35:17
you may not figure it out in your head
35:19
all the time but you know that's just
35:20
god
35:20
right he works in mysterious ways you
35:23
trust him you believe him
35:25
and your faith is going to grow so much
35:28
in this time on the earth we're in right
35:30
now and he'll set you up to be
35:32
accelerated in these days that are
35:34
coming
35:36
sage you remember remember
35:40
what kat kerr said about acceleration
35:43
about the wealth transfer you know i saw
35:45
a glimpse of this
35:46
this is very powerful okay what god is
35:49
doing
35:50
god it's always god's plan for us
35:53
to lead in this world and this globally
35:57
people need to know about the kingdom of
35:58
god they already know about the kingdom
36:00
of darkness
36:03
that's right they need to know about the
36:04
kingdom of god
36:07
what did john the baptist do he was a
36:09
forerunner what do you talk about the
36:10

39:52
since this thing has happened every one
39:54
of our services we've had two to three
39:56
services a week
39:58
there have been times not all the time
40:00

40:03
standing room
40:04
nobody has caught anything nobody has
40:08
caught
40:09

many times over
40:28
in my ministry in my life and capturing
40:31
her life and we're not backing down
40:34
okay so i've seen this happen
40:38
so this is i'm not so i i'm one of the
40:41
ones
40:42
yes i am i'm part of the army of god
40:45
and pastors and ministers listen to the
40:49
voice of the holy spirit
40:51
listen to the voice of the holy spirit
40:52
now i made a public statement
40:54
i made a public statement and i'm going
40:56
to say it here again
40:57
i says when someone told me and god
41:00
blessed them
41:01
that if jesus was here today he wear a
41:03
mask you know
41:04
no that is not true
41:08
you know i'll wear one i responded i
41:11
responded to the public statement
41:13
i says the day that i see the holy
41:17
spirit
41:18
come into our service and i see the holy
41:20
spirit wearing a mask i'll put one on
41:23
but uh but that has not happened and it
41:26
won't ever happen
41:28
you see oh yeah and then uh
41:32
i'll tell you drew as i tell you yeah
41:35
california is opening up right now i
41:37
want to
41:38
go buy and sell you know why i need food
41:42
yeah in the middle i leave that facility
41:44
i respect this facility
41:46
they want us to wear a mask fine they
41:49
want me to wear a shirt
41:50
fine they want me to wear shoes fine i
41:53
need to buy
41:54
and sell okay once once
41:57
i'm out of their airspace it's mine now
42:01
yes sure it's money and i don't wear a
42:03
mask because god gave us this free air
42:05
i'm not telling you but i'm telling you
42:09
you know many of you know that i was in
42:11
the medical center for over 20 years i
42:13
started when i was
42:14
19. okay we need
42:17
god-given air he gave us us oxygen
42:20
okay and it helps us
42:24
and you make your decision from that
42:25
point but i'm standing
42:27
on my experience in the medical center
42:30
and my experience being in the presence
42:32
of god
42:34
when you stand for god he will stand for
42:36
you
42:38
ministry go ahead catkin i would want to
42:41
also encourage
42:42
people even if they want to follow the
42:44
basic guidelines with that
42:46
i think if people want to wear them let
42:48
them wear them but i think they should
42:49
not make others that don't want to wear
42:51
them wear them
42:52
and i've heard from the medical
42:54
community and they themselves have told
42:56
me
42:56
it is not healthy to wear that mask all
42:59
the time
43:00
please please if you're outside jogging
43:03
don't wear your mask
43:04
if you're driving in your car why are
43:06
you wearing a mask
43:08
you're breathing air that is not it's
43:10
like dead air
43:11
it actually cannot help you in any way
43:14
and this medical person i had to take
43:15
someone to the emergency room not for
43:17
the virus something else and they're
43:19
they're fine
43:20
but when i was there they were just
43:22
offering this volunteering this
43:24
information to me
43:25
and they took their mask off when they
43:27
were with me
43:28
and they said people need to breathe
43:31
fresh air if you feel a need at
43:34
different times
43:35
go ahead and wear it i don't care but i
43:38
would encourage you
43:38
don't wear it when you're jogging if
43:40
you're out in the fresh air
43:42
especially if you're driving and if
43:44
you're riding a bicycle it actually
43:46
is not a very wise thing to do it's not
43:49
even healthy to do that because you use
43:51
more
43:51
air and you're sucking in more air
43:53
that's not healthy so like manuel
43:55
i understand from a medical professional
43:58
and i will also add this because the
44:00
father told me he said at one time
44:03
he will take the virus off the earth and
44:05
it will never exist again
44:08
so we this is not ever don't ever think
44:12
wearing mass and social distancing is
44:14
going to be your future
44:16
it is not your future i'll say that from
44:18
heaven it is not the future god has
44:20
planned
44:21
that is not going to be the new normal
44:23
the new normal will be filling with the
44:25
life of god
44:26
speaking his word seeing miracles happen
44:29
everywhere
44:30
and at one time this is also from the
44:32
father
44:33
they will empty the body parts warehouse
44:35
in this move of god that will last like
44:37
for generations these generations
44:39
at one point they'll empty the body of
44:41
our warehouse and there'll be no sick
44:43
people
44:43
no handicapped people this is before
44:45
jesus returns
44:47
so our life those who belong to him
44:50
who fall and run after him your life
44:53
will get greater and better and i want
44:55
to give you his word right now before we
44:57
end this is what he said
44:59
you've gone too far you can't go back
45:02
it's too late to escape
45:06
being great for him that is his words
45:09
you live by those words not what man is
45:12
saying not what the enemy is saying
45:14
they want to control you and crush you
45:16
and push you back look forward to great
45:19
days ahead
45:20
and great celebration in your life amen
45:26
character oh my god i receive it says
45:28
come on let's say it together
45:30
lord let thy word be established come on
45:32
lord let thy words
45:33
be established hey man
45:37
do uh catch do you have that uh special
45:40
cup you have i don't do demons you have
45:42
that nearby
45:49
this is a good way to make a statement
45:51
to people
45:52
and the holy spirit gave us this idea we
45:55
have
45:56
car magnets you put on your car we have
45:58
pins you can wear that say this
46:00
and the holy spirit said you're not
46:02
bashing any person
46:04
you're bashing hell saying i'm not
46:07
agreeing with you i'm not participating
46:09
with you
46:09
i have nothing to do with demons okay
46:12
that's what that says i don't
46:14
do demons is a good statement to make to
46:16
people
46:17
right now everywhere they need to know
46:18
you're not a part of the darkness and
46:20
you're not participating
46:23
wow wow you know i catch your i'm aware
46:26
this and i think it's awesome
46:28
um some people they want to know
46:31
why that the lord uh asked you to wear
46:34
pink hair
46:37
uh that wasn't actually that wasn't um
46:39
they didn't even ask me actually they
46:41
told me
46:42
thank you permission to the father to
46:45
the holy spirit energies
46:46
a long time ago in my life probably
46:49
almost 30 some years ago well i've been
46:51
born again since i was four
46:53
that was over 60 years ago when i got
46:56
born again age 4 i saw jesus step inside
46:59
of me because i'm a seer
47:01
and so that no one can tell me he's not
47:03
real okay
47:05
but i was given a commission in 1996
47:08
jesus walked through the wall of my
47:09
heart and said the father and i are
47:11
going to start taking you on tours of
47:12
heaven
47:14
and this is why we're going to do it
47:15
they want to reveal the heaven the way
47:17
it is the truth about it not what man
47:19
says
47:19
not what the enemy says and then five
47:22
years later he walked back in
47:24
my home and he said you're going to
47:26
start writing books and we're going to
47:27
let you have meetings to share about
47:29
this
47:29
but we need you to have pink highlights
47:33
in your hair
47:34
now i was not a pink hair person i think
47:37
it looks pretty good right now
47:39
but i was never the pin care person i
47:41
was the wallflower i didn't want anyone
47:43
to know me know about me
47:45
you know i was perfectly fine i was one
47:47
of 15
47:48
children so i certainly didn't need
47:50
somebody's approval of my life
47:52
but i never thought he would ask me that
47:54
but jesus came and sat next to me and
47:56
put his arm around me said we need you
47:58
to have pink hair
48:00
because when you start sharing about
48:01
heaven they're going to realize
48:03
we're a lot different than what people
48:05
thought okay
48:06
they don't feel like i'm judging them so
48:09
i can actually talk to anyone in the
48:11
world or talk to anyone anywhere
48:13
this pink hair draws people when they do
48:16
they're going to hear about jesus christ
48:17
the father holy spirit they're gonna
48:19
hear about heaven
48:20
and that was their choice they chose
48:22
pink hair
48:23
the first time i went to heaven i
48:24
realized a lot of people
48:27
have colored highlights in their hair
48:29
some was like emerald dust some diamond
48:31
dust
48:32
different colors and the father said to
48:34
me i created the rainbow
48:37
why would i not want you to have it in
48:39
your hair
48:41
wow wow so
48:44
you heard his saints it's not going away
48:47
hello oh
48:48
this thing is not going anywhere people
48:50
i've had it for a very very long time
48:54
you know what that that is that that you
48:56
know that
48:57
for us it identifies you who
49:00
uh who you are in christ and and god has
49:03
called that to you
49:04
and uh you know saints you know we're
49:07
the bible says that we are peculiar
49:09
people okay
49:11
listen show me a prophet a true prophet
49:14
from god that's not normal
49:16
that's not you know john the baptist
49:17
what was his wardrobe come on
49:19
uh what was his diet local locust and
49:22
honey
49:23
i'm glad i don't have to eat the locust
49:25
and i'm saying this i always tell people
49:27
this when pastors will say
49:29
i don't like the p here you have i said
49:31
would you rather i show up in
49:32
camel hair
49:36
it's better than chemical hair any day
49:40
yeah you know saints the lord says
49:43
look at the heart that's what that bible
49:45
says
49:46
you look at the heart of the people
49:48
that's right
49:49
you know that's that's that's how i am i
49:52
look at the heart
49:53
and when i see the fruit of the spirit
49:55
of god in people
49:57
that's it you know you know god could
50:00
send an angel
50:01
and he won't look like an angel he could
50:04
look like someone that you probably
50:05
would not
50:07
recognize that's right with that because
50:10
judging folks by their appearance you
50:12
can miss
50:13
a huge blessing yes
50:16
judging folks saints stop judging the
50:19
people that god has appointed
50:21
and has anointed you have to understand
50:24
jesus prayed all night
50:28
not one time did he go by the synagogue
50:32
and pick up religious leaders he he
50:35
could have got a pharisee
50:36
you know now later on he got paul but
50:40
look what what look what happened it
50:42
turned his life around
50:43
paul got the road experience and wrote
50:46
the damascus experience
50:48
he was turned around he counted all that
50:50
he knew
50:51
prior a loss think about that
50:54
alrighty but in the beginning he chose
50:57
uneducated fishermen he chose tax
51:00
collectors
51:01
he chose folks that normally you and i
51:04
would
51:04
judge job thanks
51:08
we have to understand you can't do this
51:11
just because somebody
51:12
does not wear the right clothes or are
51:15
our their religion or
51:16
skin color or or whatever their ethnics
51:20
uh believe you never know what god is
51:22
doing
51:24
he said love thy neighbor as thyself
51:26
that's right
51:27
my neighbor as thyself we can't be so
51:30
quick to judge
51:31
we have to look in our hearts and say
51:33
lord
51:34
talk to me talk to me thank god for
51:37
ananias
51:39
god just spoke to him and then it was
51:41
over anonymize it in question in a
51:43
second or third time
51:45
he just said okay i'm gonna do whatever
51:47
i need you want me to do
51:49
and paul wrote almost two-thirds of the
51:52
new testaments his epistles
51:54
god no i was um i was just gonna ask
51:56
something real quick paul
51:58
went you know paul went from which was
52:00
saul he went from persecuting and even
52:03
holding the coats of the
52:04
the uh apostles and other people so they
52:07
could be
52:08
killed right that's what he did he held
52:10
him so they could be stoned
52:11
he went from that to preaching the
52:14
gospel to any person who would listen
52:17
to kings to beggars he was releasing the
52:20
anointing everywhere okay
52:22
and i will tell you that i was in rome
52:25
when i went to go to rome
52:27
and i was near the um the coliseum
52:30
i saw these great lights being a seer
52:33
i saw these great lights of distance
52:35
shooting up into the heavens from the
52:37
ground
52:38
and our our guide we had i said what is
52:41
over there
52:42
and they said why i said i see great
52:44
beams of light shooting up like the
52:46
glory of god into the heavens he said
52:48
that's the prison they kept paul in
52:51
paul created an open portal of heaven by
52:54
the way he
52:55
lived his life he honored god
52:58
god left a marker that was still remains
53:01
to this day is still over there where he
53:04
was
53:04
even in prison the light and the glory
53:06
of god was shining
53:09
wow saints did you get that i sure
53:12
received it
53:13
look look how that anointing is still
53:15
get moving the presence of god
53:18

02:15
collard greens be careful we are very
02:18
careful what we asked for or even talk

i don't know what the mailman would do
02:23
if they were delivering you know
02:26
five pounds of greens every day for two
02:28
weeks in a row they might inspect us
02:31

02:48
send her something you can send
02:50
her a picture of a flower or draw her
02:53

02:55
flowers i think that's her
02:57

she loves waterfalls
03:01
fountains and so so someone's saying
03:05
cat's earbud is low my earbud is low
03:09

03:10

03:12
you've got burned down though i don't is
03:15
it not supposed to be pointing down
03:18
because i don't understand i can hear
03:20
now
03:25
whatever that means i couldn't hear
03:27
anything before
03:29
it was like i had something stuck in my
03:32
head
03:33
oh my gosh you guys are
03:37
you you are witnessing what i have to
03:41
live with every day
03:43
it was like something was stuck in my
03:44
ear and then take it out i hadn't told
03:46
you i had to get a miracle
03:51
[Music]
03:53
oh it's gone
03:58
wait it's got that i got something stuck
03:59
on my ear thing again
04:03

04:05
just took it out of my ear oh
04:06
take it out again do you want to switch
04:08
here can you guys hear her talk
04:10
cat can you hear me because
04:13
maybe this is pointing in the mind maybe
04:16
it's in the wrong ear
04:19
i don't know see it's right there in my
04:21
ear
04:22
yeah this is going to play all over the
04:24
world you know that right because
04:26
okay so just make sure you you guys have
04:30
your devices turned up
04:31
all the way yeah because some of y'all
04:33
are saying you could hear
04:34
fine some of you are saying cat's too
04:37
low
04:38
so i don't know i've never been told i
04:46
[Music]
04:54
okay okay all right
04:58
so you're going to read the first you
05:00
want me to read it are you going to read
05:01
it
05:01
well you know it's one that we actually
05:03
talked kind of about
05:04
not y'all just us talked about it and
05:07
this palm even asked many times um
05:10
and many different places but somebody
05:14
wants to know i'm just given
05:15
first name so if you have a question
05:18
we're saying your first name
05:20
you won't say your last name so this
05:23
question is from
05:24
john and john wants to know why
05:27
i can hear again it's another miracle
05:29
from heaven
05:30
i took the earbud out okay
05:34
we are now escorting the red pepper
05:37
flaked
05:37
greens out of the studio so now we have
05:41
no audience
05:42
except the studio cat and he's ignoring
05:44
me
05:45
john has a question he wanted to know
05:48
why
05:48
[Music]
05:50
sometimes people charge to have an event
05:54
you know i never charge i never have
05:57
charged
05:57
not in all the years we've been doing
05:59
this so people who say
06:01
you know they don't help or don't give
06:04
they're
06:08
i do like every day i help somebody
06:11
but we don't charge because god said we
06:13
couldn't
06:14
hello if you said you're not charging
06:16
for your events
06:18
now we can sell products if we have
06:20
products
06:22
even take up a free will offering but as
06:24
far as in order to come
06:30
uh places invited me it's the people who
06:33
were
06:34
creating and hosting the event
06:37
needed to charge something for very good
06:39
reasons
06:40
having done this for many years and i
06:42
have events myself
06:44
our events that we have here in florida
06:47
cost anywhere between 12
06:49
and 25 000 every time we have one
06:54
we have to pay for the event place we
06:56
have to have materials printed
06:58
we have to have camera people sound
07:01
people we have to have people who help
07:03
do different things uh maybe get all the
07:06
people
07:06
car park whatever you want to call it
07:09
and if we provide
07:10
snacks or stuff that means we're feeding
07:12
our staff if we have an
07:13
all-day event that means we have
07:15
provided them with food for like
07:17
lunch and dinner and we have other
07:20
things we have to do if we do a photo a
07:22
workshop
07:23
or a prophetic art workshop we are
07:26
buying materials i'm just giving you
07:28
an idea of why sometimes people we don't
07:30
we pay for this all out of our pocket
07:33
as a blessing to help you but but there
07:36
are fees we have if we have another
07:37
speaker
07:38
we pay that speaker so we have all kinds
07:41
of
07:42
fees that have we have to pay ourselves
07:45
some people can't afford to do that
07:48
such as the awesome event they just had
07:50
in oregon
07:52
the rise summit which was not a
07:55
conference trust me it was a big
07:57
difference
07:58
they went 11 hours a day just so you
08:01
understand this
08:03
it would probably cost between 30 and 40
08:06
000
08:06
to do this event that they had in oregon
08:10
and let me tell you what that's not real
08:12
easy money just to come up with
08:15
they decided to charge a fee not
08:18
only did they pay people who worked the
08:21
conference because they got
08:22
professionals to do it
08:24
you can sometimes use volunteers in some
08:26
positions but there's some positions you
08:28
can't do that with
08:29
the camera people the sound people the
08:32
lighting
08:33
okay they have security
08:38
or they're still in partial kind of
08:39
shutdown up there
08:41
and of course if you're going to
08:44
broadcast
08:46
to the entire world that's called a
08:49
bandwidth
08:50
i know a little bit about that stuff not
08:52
so much about the wi-fi whatever
08:54
but i do know that if you're going to
08:56
have a broader band of people
08:58
or how many people are coming on to
09:00
watch it online
09:02
they pay for that no one right now has a
09:05
network
09:06
like the fake news cnn or the other fake
09:10
news places that have
09:11
huge studios and huge networks with
09:14
satellites and everything
09:16
they pay a whole lot more for their
09:17
stuff but most places don't have that
09:20
they have to
09:21
they have to run special cameras
09:23
sometimes or they have to at least
09:25
pay for a broader bandwidth so that they
09:28
can't
09:29
go to just a thousand people but if they
09:31
add people like two thousand three
09:33
thousand four thousand five thousand
09:35
they have to expand whatever how they
09:39
all do this
09:39
frequency use of the satellites whatever
09:42
it
09:42
costs money when you keep adding people
09:46
who are going to come online to watch or
09:49
it will crash i know that because we've
09:52
been in many events where
09:53
it crashed so if you're going to do it
09:55
with excellence and you have to pay out
09:57
these people
09:58
to be there they have to be there all
10:00
day because these things
10:01
literally lasted from morning till
10:03
evening
10:04
they had 10 and 20 minutes segments then
10:07
they'd have someone speak
10:08
they would have the most amazing worship
10:11
if you were one of those people
10:12
who paid a price to watch all of these
10:15
uh
10:16
events that took place i mean the people
10:19
speaking and sharing
10:20
very powerful key people on this day
10:24
they wanted you to have the word of the
10:26
lord about everything i just lost my
10:28
little piece
10:29
excuse me see it's right there
10:32
these cost money too by the way i didn't
10:35
pay for it but i think margaret did
10:41
it's back in there i hope that i hope
10:43
you're not being bored by me because i'm
10:44
gonna be
10:45
kind of serious right now if people are
10:48
gonna do something in excellence
10:49
the rise summit was not about somebody
10:51
saying this is our church
10:53
we're gonna have this event and charge
10:55
people money so we can stick it all in
10:57
our pockets
10:57
that is not what happened they had so
11:00
many speakers that were a part of this
11:03
okay and they got paid they earned
11:06
it says pay you know pay what is due to
11:09
someone who's
11:10
whatever that goes
11:13
give honor to whom his honors do
11:16
and so they honored everybody everybody
11:18
got paid to come
11:20
in person or to even share online why
11:22
they took their own time
11:24
to do that for everybody and some of
11:27
these things that will change your life
11:28
forever
11:29
but for 11 hours a day for these two
11:32
days plus
11:33
on sunday they let me speak even longer
11:37
that was a huge event i saw so many
11:39
people in this place
11:40
serving some were serving but a lot of
11:42
them were actually people they hired
11:44
to do it right and that is why
11:48
they had to charge a fee no one
11:50
complained about the fee
11:52
for 69 i do know this you could watch
11:56
all of all of the events all of the
11:58
speakers who were on there all day
11:59
both days i think you also got sunday
12:02
included for free
12:03
but you got to keep all of the content
12:07
for three years and watch as many times
12:09
as you wanted to
12:11
most places that charge a fee you watch
12:13
it for that event and then it's none
12:16
but they wanted to make a special they
12:18
also
12:19
had people there that was they were
12:21
directed to
12:22
minister directly to all the people
12:24
online
12:25
so they didn't miss getting impartations
12:28
or pray prayed for
12:29
they even had people in different rooms
12:31
doing that
12:32
so this was really one of the best
12:34
events i've seen
12:36
as far as excellence being done which
12:38
god requires us to do it in excellence
12:40
and they were ministering to the whole
12:42
world they actually had 45 different
12:44
nations watching or
12:47
present i think they had 20 nations
12:49
present
12:50
and they had all the rest of them
12:52
watching online and they were really
12:54
happy that they could have two thousand
12:55
people sign up online
12:57
it ended up by being six thousand
13:00
because they're hungry to know the truth
13:03
right now
13:04
what is happening right now what is god
13:06
going to do in the near future
13:08
i know it was called a reformation god's
13:10
reforming our country
13:12
and bringing people in who think like he
13:14
thinks i'm not
13:15
dissing everyone else but if you're not
13:17
on god's timeline
13:19
you'll be reporting things that may be
13:21
happening 200 years from now
13:23
or things how they happened in the past
13:25
when god's doing a new thing
13:27
you need to know what that is so this
13:29
was a great
13:30
uh event i was really pleased to be a
13:32
part of that
13:34
and also what they did on the side
13:37
besides that was those who came
13:39
who traveled to come were able to have
13:41
many teaching videos made that we could
13:43
then later
13:45
use to train you in different
13:46
revelations
13:48
so let me tell you everybody worked hard
13:50
the whole entire time
13:52
and i applauded them and thanked them
13:54
all those who served
13:55
even those who were just hired they did
13:57
a great job so so you understand that's
13:59
why sometimes there is a fee
14:02
because people don't have maybe they had
14:04
a higher outside
14:05
sound more sound system stuff brought in
14:08
more people to just work in the
14:10
sanctuary their south
14:11
to make sure everybody got seated and or
14:13
they were serving the leaders in the
14:15
other rooms
14:16
it was powerful and so that's why
14:19
people sometimes have to charge a fee
14:22
and sometimes they don't even have a big
14:24
staff so they do have to hire outside
14:26
people to work
14:28
but you know it's always going to be
14:29
worth it you are investing in your life
14:32
in your future to get revelation that we
14:35
need right now
14:36
so that's the answer to john that's why
14:40
they had to charge
14:41
because all this excess um fees
14:45
and costs that they had to pay out to
14:48
make it great
14:49
and i can tell you everybody was undone
14:51
and overwhelmed by the presence of the
14:53
living god
14:54
angels were there i'm telling you i saw
14:57
the angels that poured into that place
14:59
especially during the worship so if they
15:01
have one in your area they're planning
15:03
to do the next one i think is going to
15:05
be in nashville
15:06
i think it might be towards the end of
15:08
this month i think
15:09
that they're going to have another rise
15:12
risc
15:12
summit you can go to johnny enlo's
15:15
website and find out about it
15:17
but let me tell you these are people
15:18
with integrity who've known god a long
15:21
time who speak for him
15:23
and so therefore it's okay if you have
15:25
to pay
15:26
a fee trust me it will come back to you
15:28
many times over so jen's stand stay and
15:30
wind it up
15:33
okay i have another question right here
15:34
from eddie
15:36
eddie in oh it doesn't say oh yes eddie
15:40
in new york city wow new york city
15:43
i don't know if you all know that but i
15:45
actually was born in new york in upstate
15:47
new york
15:48
i actually have a say i have a part of a
15:50
realm there
15:51
because when you come from heaven to
15:53
earth where you're born
15:55
in that part of the earth you have some
15:58
uh
15:58
you have access to authority because you
16:01
were sent there from heaven and that's
16:02
where you were
16:03
born i've always wanted to go to new
16:05
york city and speak i have not been
16:07
invited to new york city to speak but i
16:09
know it's going to be coming
16:11
and god loves new york city it is a
16:13
major port
16:15
number one it is the main port that let
16:17
people come in from
16:18
all over the world they wanted freedom
16:21
and liberty
16:22
and they came they came by the tens of
16:24
thousands probably hundreds of thousands
16:26
of people
16:27
have come to that port to make their new
16:30
home here in america
16:32
and right now they might want to pack
16:34
their bags and leave but i'm sure
16:35
they'll be coming back soon
16:37
you know what i'm talking about but one
16:40
of these questions that eddie is asking
16:43
is that they were concerned that people
16:44
several people started having dreams or
16:46
visions
16:47
of a tsunami hitting new york
16:51
and so they were concerned that it was
16:52
going to be wiped out and done away with
16:55
and so now they have a little bit of
16:56
fear in their life because of that i can
16:58
assure you
17:00
there will be no tsunami hitting new
17:02
york how do i know
17:04
well number one i'm from there and god
17:05
has said over and over again he would
17:07
establish a place for me to speak there
17:09
and a place to even have a a place there
17:12
like a branch of our company would be
17:14
there
17:15
and he hasn't changed his mind sometimes
17:18
dreams can be just that a dream
17:21
sometimes he might send it so you can
17:23
pray and take authority over the
17:25
situation that the dream was about
17:28
but i can assure you it's not going to
17:29
be wiped off the map
17:31
and neither is california god's going to
17:34
take california for his own it's going
17:35
to be a whole region of light as is new
17:38
york city
17:39
and you would think by looking at these
17:41
places is so wicked so evil so much junk
17:43
going on don't you understand
17:45
that's the enemy so insistent on taking
17:49
it away from god
17:51
the enemy knows several places that god
17:53
has marked on his own timeline
17:56
he will use in powerful ways and i know
17:59
new york city will be known in a
18:00
different way
18:02
very soon in the future but he's not
18:04
going to wipe it out with a tsunami
18:06
so chalk that up to maybe too much pizza
18:08
i don't know
18:10
but i will just tell you this no
18:12
tsunami's going to wipe out new york
18:13
city
18:14
and so i hope that helps you eddie
18:18
to be more at peace about that besides
18:20
the fact that if you were a weather
18:22
warrior
18:23
you know how to take authority over that
18:25
thank you all you weather warriors
18:27
you remember that that just happened
18:29
right
18:30
uh all the earthquakes that were going
18:32
on and um where was that jen
18:36
the earthquakes was new zealand off the
18:39
coast of new zealand is that where that
18:40
happened and
18:42
and they were they were expecting a
18:43
tsunami to hit all the way from the
18:45
hawaiian islands all the way back into
18:47
new zealand
18:48
and do great destructive uh measures
18:52
with a tsunami which we all took
18:54
authority over and said it couldn't come
18:56
sent the host to prevent that from
18:58
happening
18:58
and they were so shocked that it never
19:02
happened and the one earthquake was at
19:04
8.0
19:06
there was three in a row in the same
19:08
area
19:09
and normally that is how a tsunami
19:11
happens
19:12
it starts under the water that force
19:15
picks up with the force coming out of
19:17
the earth it pushes the water
19:19
and it builds and builds a bill
19:20
sometimes it can be 75 100 feet high the
19:22
wave hits when it hits the country
19:24
it never came because we said no to it
19:28
so i can just tell you eddie there's
19:30
lots of people in new york and all over
19:32
the already know how to take authority
19:34
but god himself has plans for new york
19:37
and especially
19:38
new york city because of it opening its
19:41
arms god doesn't forget the great things
19:43
that were done in areas okay so great
19:45
things happen there
19:46
and he has plans for new york city
19:49
and so i do have another question right
19:51
here this is an interesting one
19:53
and this is from somebody in middle
19:55
lothian virginia they didn't put their
19:57
name down
19:58
so i'm going to just say their question
20:00
was how did adam and eve
20:02
make it to heaven before jesus came down
20:06
to earth to die on the cross for our
20:07
sins how could they get to heaven
20:10
well number one when adam and eve passed
20:13
away
20:14
nobody was going to heaven at that time
20:17
the only ones who were in heaven besides
20:19
the angels and the army of heaven
20:21
was elijah and enoch
20:24
elijah and enoch were taken up to heaven
20:27
both in their physical bodies
20:29
so adam eve when they passed away they
20:31
were taken to
20:32
abraham's bosom that's what or paradise
20:36
it's down in the earth it's a beautiful
20:38
amazing place that god made
20:40
and there they were sent there instead
20:42
of to hell because they believed in god
20:45
himself
20:46
as a great creator the one that they
20:48
worshipped
20:49
and because that says in the bible they
20:51
were counted as righteous
20:53
they were sent to abraham's bosom lived
20:55
a beautiful life there
20:57
and actually when christ came and died
20:59
for our sins it
21:00
said he led captivity captive which
21:02
means
21:03
when his spiritual body left the cross
21:05
it didn't go straight to heaven that
21:07
would not be scriptural
21:08
he did descend in abraham's bosom
21:10
because he had told the thief that day
21:13
when the seed was on the cross and
21:15
christ looked at him and said
21:17
that he the thief said remember me and
21:20
christ said today
21:21
not tomorrow but today you will be with
21:23
me in paradise that's abraham's bosom
21:26
so christ descended off of the cross
21:28
went down
21:29
in abraham's bosom was there he got to
21:31
see abraham isaac jacob
21:33
he got to see joseph he got to see
21:35
solomon
21:37
he got to see adam and eve who were down
21:39
there also
21:40
even the one who raised him joseph who
21:43
raised him
21:44
he was down in abraham's bosom he also
21:47
got to see the thief
21:48
so because of that because of god
21:51
holding them in a place where he counted
21:53
on them righteous
21:54
christ preached the gospel to them and
21:56
then later when he was done
21:58
and the third day in hell which we'll
22:00
probably talk about at the end of this
22:02
broadcast
22:03
they were all allowed to go into heaven
22:06
so they didn't have to go to heaven
22:08
way back in the day they were held by
22:10
god in this beautiful place it had
22:12
running water it had beautiful buildings
22:15
it had tables with feasts on them that's
22:17
where those
22:18
went that he counted righteous so i hope
22:20
that answers your question
22:24
i have another question here if i can
22:27
find it
22:30
i think jen had a question did you have
22:32
a question jen
22:34
she's playing with the studio cat right
22:38
now
22:40
we do have a studio cat in case you ever
22:42
wondered they're not talking about me
22:45
they're talking about a real cat okay
22:49
so i think she's gonna go get her
22:51
question
22:53
i know some people are still wondering
22:55
and asking what about
22:56
anything new that's going on i will be
22:59
answering that tomorrow
23:00
not tomorrow okay tomorrow is my mom's
23:02
birthday we will still have the q and a
23:05
session on wednesday this wednesday 2
23:08
p.m eastern standard time uh a chat with
23:11
stephen cat that would be steve schultz
23:13
who will be having our broadcast
23:15
and at that time we will be answering
23:17
some new things that have come up
23:19
about the government about the elections
23:22
and about what's going to be happening
23:24
real soon
23:26
i hope you've all been watching johnny
23:28
inlaw or hank cunaman
23:31
and several others who are still talking
23:33
about the things that god is doing right
23:34
now
23:35
and they're all saying the same thing
23:37
that's the most none of them stepped
23:39
back and said god changed his mind or
23:41
abandoned america
23:43
that is not what happened
23:46
so i'll let jenna ask a question i know
23:49
she's got one probably somebody sent in
23:51
or made a comment on don't stop sending
23:53
your comments
23:54
okay that are questions we we will
23:56
record them and then jen can say
23:57
something so what do you have to say jen
23:59
so um somebody commented on
24:03
the uh the post that
24:07
you did last night with the calendar
24:10
for yes yes i said i don't know if you
24:13
guys saw that or not but
24:14
it's uh it's a post that we did for
24:18
uh resurrection sunday resurrection
24:20
sunday and
24:21
so i'm gonna hand this to you yes okay
24:24
so they wanted to know
24:26
if those were the actual angels that are
24:30
outside the tomb of christ ask him if
24:33
they can see this
24:35
hang on jen's looking at
24:39
it yeah you can see it you can see that
24:42
okay you see the two angels and then
24:43
they wanted to know
24:45
if one was funny and one was serious
24:48
okay
24:48
um these are the actual angels i don't
24:52
know if you all know that but a couple
24:53
years ago
24:54
i did an event that was an on land event
24:58
it wasn't
24:59
cruz and steve schultz um flew me over
25:02
there with the rest of their team and
25:04
they did
25:04
an event that lasted almost two weeks
25:08
in israel they pushed back me
25:12
i think my husband knew he went with me
25:13
but i didn't realize we were going to go
25:15
to places for eight hours like really
25:17
walk like
25:18
up hills up mountains down inside you
25:21
know underground like half a mile
25:24
and that was quite a thing for me to do
25:27
that
25:28
but when we went to the tomb these two
25:31
angels that were there that's why we
25:34
have a picture of a minute this is our
25:35
2021 calendar that i showed you
25:38
this was april again here it is this is
25:40
april and
25:42
yes of course if god's going to send two
25:46
angels on assignment together he'll
25:48
always send one with a sense of humor
25:49
and one that is so serious you know
25:52
they're all about holiness and
25:54
righteousness and
25:56
then they send a character with him
25:57
who's very funny you know just to break
26:00
it up i guess
26:02
but these two angels were not just
26:04
chosen
26:05
to guard the tomb and yes they're still
26:08
there that's why we put them in the
26:09
calendar
26:10
but they also were chosen to be
26:14
in that they were chosen to be in the
26:16
tomb of christ
26:17
they were also chosen to be the same two
26:20
angels who brought the cup
26:21
in the garden remember before christ was
26:24
crucified he had to drink that cup
26:26
that had every evil wicked thing every
26:29
sin that could ever be done
26:31
that he was going to put in his body and
26:33
that would be crucified on the cross
26:35
the same two angels were the ones that
26:38
brought that cup
26:39
they were the same two angels in the
26:40
garden with him that were comforting him
26:43
when he was struggling about what to do
26:45
and then he says to the father
26:46
not my will but your will be done he
26:49
actually surrendered everything in the
26:51
garden
26:52
before he went to the cross it was
26:54
actually harder to do that in the garden
26:56
and so the same two angels were rewarded
26:59
for doing that for bringing the cup from
27:01
heaven that was filled with all that
27:04
stuff so christ could then have to
27:06
accept to drink it and he did and that's
27:08
how our sins are forgiven it's the only
27:10
reason why
27:11
he is the only way to heaven
27:14
christ bore all of our sins on the cross
27:17
abolish the iniquities that were against
27:19
us so when you receive christ as your
27:21
savior
27:22
he wipes all of that sin out of you
27:25
which gives you
27:26
entrance not just to heaven but to be in
27:28
eternity with them forever and ever
27:30
so these two angels are representations
27:33
are the ones i saw
27:35
i hope you enjoyed that story and you
27:37
all know
27:38
that christ did did more dying on the
27:41
cross was for our sins
27:43
ascending into hell like it says in the
27:46
book of colossians and
27:47
wiping up hell of ruining the very
27:50
features of the principalities and
27:51
powers there
27:54
releasing fire from himself and burning
27:57
some of their features and melting their
27:58
faces
27:59
and as a little girl i used to see these
28:02
big demons walking around
28:04
not my home but walking around and their
28:06
faces look like melted wax and i used to
28:08
think
28:09
as a little girl i wonder what they did
28:11
well i found out later when i was
28:13
actually taken
28:14
back in time and actually was in hell
28:17
and
28:17
saw what christ did when he spoiled
28:20
principalities and powers
28:22
stripped all the gemstones off of satan
28:25
that when god made him he put them on
28:27
him say
28:28
jesus took them off of him and then the
28:31
last thing jesus did before he
28:33
ascended up into the tomb to get his
28:35
body back
28:37
he took the keys of hell death and the
28:40
grave
28:40
away from satan who no longer has
28:44
them and that gives christ access to
28:47
some very special things for us and so
28:50
i would have given that story yesterday
28:52
but we had so much going on
28:54
we really didn't have a lot of time and
28:56
for those who want to know what was
28:58
going on
28:59
my one brother not rj but my one brother
29:03
decided to to go ahead and transition my
29:05
one brother moved to heaven the other
29:07
day
29:08
so we've been very busy planning things
29:10
for his celebration
29:12
here we're celebrating with him in
29:14
heaven
29:15
i have no grief when somebody moves to
29:17
heaven not even a family member
29:19
i've been there too many times and it
29:21
was it was absolutely
29:23
amazing that he he didn't want to go for
29:26
some time so didn't
29:28
and so finally his mansion was done got
29:31
it told me on monday his mansion was
29:32
almost done but not quite
29:34
and so it was on i think friday
29:38
night or saturday afternoon i think it
29:40
was when he finally moved to heaven
29:42
and we we're have so much joy in our
29:44
lives but you know trying to make if
29:46
you've never had to make arrangements
29:48
for memorial services or other things it
29:51
is
29:51
very time consuming and because we have
29:54
over 100 family members we had to get a
29:56
hold of everybody all of our friends
29:58
his friends and of course his wife
30:01
linda her family and her friends it is a
30:04
huge undertaking
30:06
let me tell you we're going to have a
30:07
celebration party for him here on earth
30:10
almost maybe like they do in heaven and
30:13
we are
30:13
so happy you don't have to send me your
30:16
condolences you know don't have to
30:18
help me with the sorrow i'm feeling
30:20
there is no sorrow
30:21

30:24
resting in peace he's very active right
30:26
now
30:26
is still in his throne room party and we
30:29
know for sure that he will be visiting
30:31
christmas town he loves christmas

30:36
admired nicholas
30:37
who gave gifts to children and i want
30:39
you to know my brother that particular
30:41
brother
30:41
spent most of his life feeding the poor
30:45
helping people with homes giving stuff
30:47
away to them
30:48
he loved to create toys for children
30:52
and so he really has given his whole
30:54
life
30:55
and now his season was up on the earth
30:58
and he has
30:59
now uh moved to heaven where he is now

32:56
they will make it look so so believable
32:59
that it's us
33:00
but if they're asking you for money from
33:03
the facebook
33:04
if they're telling you to donate to some
33:06

33:17
desperate help send this money on paypal
33:19
to this place they're probably
33:21
keeping it that it's not us okay

God's Timeline Part 1
by The Kat Kerr Jan 21, 2013
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nI59VT1FO0w
or https://youtu.be/nI59VT1FO0w

00:00
hello body of Christ this is Revelator
00:03
cat kerbs
00:04
and I have a powerful message for you
00:06
from the Father
00:07
it's called God's timeline I want you to
00:10
know that in the throne room of God
00:12
embedded in the floor of the throne room
00:14
is a timeline that is the only thing
00:17
that resembles time in heaven you live
00:20
an eternity there there's no watches no
00:22
calendars no clocks but God from the
00:25
beginning of time had things he planned
00:28
to do on this earth and when that
00:30
happened that fullness of time would
00:31
come well I want you to know that a
00:33
fullness of time has come and you're
00:35
living in a spiritual time on this earth
00:37
that never existed before and will never
00:39
exist again God calls it that heaven
00:42
invasion the days of greater glory Joel
00:45
2 whatever you want to call it God has a
00:47
purpose for us on this earth he said
00:50
that we as the believers I'm the search
00:52
we'll do some of the greatest things
00:53
amidst miracles supernatural signs and
00:56
wonders on this earth that have never
00:57
been done before and the reason he wants
01:00
to do that is to erase the great area on
01:02
this earth that exists that says there
01:03
is no body now I did promise you that I
01:06
would share what happened on election
01:08
day so many people who stood for a
01:10
platform of life and light thought that
01:13
we lost well I want you to know that
01:14
what made the difference was your
01:17
prayers and your declarations months
01:20
leading up to those days people had
01:22
already been praying on their face for
01:24
God's will to be done and the father
01:26
said for the first time since he made
01:28
this earth millions of believers laid
01:30
down their differences of denominations
01:32
of opinions and came together an
01:35
agreement for his will to be done on
01:37
this earth now I can certainly tell you
01:39
that God never likes it when someone
01:41
who's in power wants death the death of
01:44
children the death of your rights God
01:47
doesn't have a government of control in
01:49
heaven
01:50
government of freedom and liberty in
01:52
heaven for us to rejoice him and be with
01:55
him and and be able to worship in
01:57
freedom and so God much you know that he
01:59
has selected this time I know through
02:01
some of the greatest things he's ever
02:02
done he said in the spirit realm on
02:05
election day if you could only see the
02:08
babble that took place in the spirit
02:09
realm your prayers produce power the
02:13
effectual fervent prayer of a righteous
02:15
man or woman availeth much power and if
02:19
you could have seen what happened to the
02:20
forces of darkness on Election Day
02:22
because of our prayer of agreement God's
02:24
already got everything he needs to turn
02:26
the the whole tide of this country and
02:29
burning it back to righteousness but he
02:31
he needs you to continue to declare you
02:34
will be done don't stop saying it you
02:36
have to believe that that's gonna happen
02:39
but God needs us to stand together and
02:41
he said that it's time for Sustainable
02:43
believers and live our life the way that
02:46
they can see the glory of God in our
02:48
lives we're gonna push back darkness and
02:50
the days of had he said that it will be
02:52
so different to live in this planet for
02:54
a quite a while on this earth that
02:56
because the Gloria will be so great that
02:58
evil would even flee host cities sin
03:01
won't be able to remain their crime
03:04
won't even better remain them he said
03:06
that it'll get so the line will be drawn
03:08
so clearly that the enemy will have to
03:10
build cities of darkness for people to
03:12
go sin in and the cities that hold the
03:15
glory of God and these days coming in
03:17
their people will drive their dead and
03:19
those citizens because of the glory on
03:21
God's people that be raised from the
03:23
dead I can tell you that he took me
03:25
forward in time and showed me some of
03:27
the many things that begin to happen
03:28
when we begin to really manifest his
03:30
power in his presence if you have any
03:32
darkness in your life I would encourage
03:34
you to get it out of you loose it from
03:37
your soul because you can't stand up and
03:39
try to do things for God if you have
03:40
part of the enemy in you he will come
03:42
and tear you up his plan for you is to
03:45
kill steal and destroy your destiny he
03:47
doesn't wait to do anything for God but
03:49
I can tell you why the attack has been
03:51
so vicious over the last few years as
03:53
hell is terrified that we are about to
03:57
find out who we are made in the image of
03:59
God I can tell you there is no darkness
04:01
and have
04:02
no sin in heaven no fear in heaven
04:04
there's power there's glory
04:07
there's righteousness there's a life in
04:09
heaven and he's about to pour that and
04:11
his people on this earth you need to not
04:13
be living in fear you're not hearing god
04:15
you're not using the right message if
04:17
you think these are the perilous times
04:18
the word says perilous times will come
04:21
but they are not here yet
04:23
God said the world would know us by our
04:25
love for each other and they certainly
04:27
don't do that do they
04:28
well God's about to change that it says
04:31
the right the wealth of the wicked is
04:32
later for the just in the righteous that
04:35
hasn't happened yet either and if
04:36
everything burns and ends now there's no
04:39
economy then how are you gonna use this
04:41
money he's about to transfer to us I can
04:44
tell you what he's about to take
04:45
believers and make them entrepreneurs
04:47
you just stand in agreement that God's
04:50
gonna use you get your life ready let
04:52
him process you any way that he needs to
04:55
get filled with the light of God with
04:57
the Word of God
04:58
get filled with the love of God he's
05:01
about to baptize us with fire and the
05:03
Scriptures word says in the last days I
05:05
will pour out my spirit on all flesh
05:06
that has not happened yet he's about to
05:09
touch every living human being with the
05:11
fire of his passion and let me tell you
05:13
what there will be a reaction and when
05:16
it comes it's either gonna expose
05:17
everything in you or you're gonna care
05:19
yet if I were you I would carry it for
05:22
his glory but don't say that we have had
05:25
a defeat I know that the forces of Hell
05:28
are being unleashed to try to bring fear
05:30
into this world and fear into your life
05:31
and make it look like nothing is gonna
05:33
happen yeah duh no God he is your father
05:40
he may need you for a purpose on this
05:42
earth you don't even know about one one
05:45
ounce of his breath can do to this world
05:47
he knows who your enemies are
05:50
he knows what hell is playing for you
05:52
and he's about to break the back of the
05:55
enemy and his foot and you put some ugly
05:57
stomping on the devil's head you begin
06:00
to rejoice in the matter where you are
06:01
right now if you're our believer if you
06:03
stand and receive the blood sacrifice of
06:05
Jesus Christ the only way to heaven
06:07
you need to begin to declare in your
06:09
life what you want to do for him don't
06:11
even ask you for something unless it's
06:13
him you didn't have a passion and a
06:15
hunger for him like you never have
06:17
before ignore the words of those who
06:19
criticize you who laugh at you let me
06:22
tell you pretty soon they're gonna be
06:23
running to you for help
06:24
you need to know that he chose you he
06:27
doesn't he doesn't choose those who are
06:29
qualified he qualifies the chosen if you
06:32
remember the body of Christ he wants to
06:34
use you so lay down your differences
06:36
stop getting offended stop getting in
06:39
anger stop worrying against blessed we
06:43
wrestle not against flesh and blood but
06:45
against spiritual forces and you have
06:47
powerful spiritual weapons on the inside
06:49
of you you need to know that your birth
06:52
was not a mistake no matter what you've
06:54
been through up until this point in your
06:56
life God is about to do something for
06:59
you you need to rejoice and worship Him
07:01
because he's worthy to be praised people
07:04
can call me all kinds of names they want
07:06
to I am NOT a false prophet they preach
07:08
any other gospel than the blood of Jesus
07:10
Christ and I can take theirs one way
07:12
there it's his blood if you've received
07:14
it because of his blood you have power
07:16
and authority in this earth to rule and
07:18
reign God said he would have put Genesis
07:21
1:26 in there for nothing if he wasn't
07:23
going to allow a time on this earth
07:25
little rule and reign to the power of
07:27
Jesus Christ you find out who you are
07:30
and know that the enemy has been
07:33
pursuing you to destroy you there's only
07:35
one person who can make a difference and
07:37
that is Jesus Christ and he came for a
07:40
purpose he came to die for you that you
07:42
might have a life not to see you can
07:44
make it through we get to do amazing
07:47
powerful things that he showed me like
07:49
stop earthquakes and make them put it
07:51
back the way it was before it started
07:53
stop the tsunamis go and speak to the
07:55
fault lines and tell them it cannot move
07:57
go to punch famine lands and speak to
08:00
the grindin Sea Life spring forth that's
08:03
the power of God that this earth is
08:05
about to see don't you want to rock this
08:07
world for him so lay down your
08:10
differences and begin to make a
08:12
difference and understand that the word
08:14
talks about these days of greater glory
08:16
when this world will know that now
08:19
the glory of God will cover this earth
08:20
we didn't get to do that for him but you
08:24
can't gossip and backbiting judge and
08:26
criticize and think God's going to fill
08:28
you with his power
08:30
you can't run after the things of the
08:32
enemy and take darkness inside of you I
08:35
think God's gonna let you stand and use
08:37
his power you have to be standing on a
08:40
platform of righteousness let your life
08:43
count there's years left on this earth I
08:46
can tell you on God's timeline for
08:48
planet Earth mankind not the earth but
08:52
mankind has a 6,000 year lease I'm
08:55
playing at earth if you will go and look
08:57
at the Jewish calendar you will find out
09:00
that it is the year of five thousand
09:02
seven hundred and seventy three that
09:04
shows a long time left on this earth and
09:06
that's a good thing because we have to
09:08
make a difference for him we have to
09:10
lose the kingdom of God and then rule
09:13
and reign in that kingdom before the
09:14
millennial reign never gets here before
09:16
the tribulation gets here before the
09:18
perilous times get here we get to do
09:21
that for him you need to read the Word
09:24
of God and find out what it says grace
09:26
was given to you so you could have your
09:28
sins wiped out grace wasn't given to you
09:31
so you could live a life of sin and
09:34
you're gonna read the book of Romans see
09:36
what it says about sinning see what it
09:38
says about darkness in you we're suppose
09:40
we filled with the light of God your
09:42
spiritual body inside of your physical
09:44
body is made out of light we're supposed
09:47
to shed that light in this world so the
09:48
world will see him and want him
09:51
you have an understanding of the spirit
09:53
realm around you that your eyes cannot
09:55
see the word says everything that you
09:57
see was made by that which was unseen
09:59
and let me give you a clue the spirit
10:01
realm does not belong to the enemy and
10:04
it does not belong to the New Age
10:05
movement it was here before they were
10:07
here it was here before this world was
10:09
made
10:10
it's what heaven is made out of heaven
10:12
is a spiritual world beyond the known
10:15
universe filled with the light and glory
10:18
of God where no sin can enter in he's
10:21
coming for a glorious church without
10:23
spot that sin without wrinkle that
10:25
you're flushing your attitudes and your
10:27
opinions showing up if you think we're
10:30
at that place then maybe he's coming
10:32
right now cuz let me tell you his soon
10:34
is not our soon a thousand years to him
10:38
is nothing and I can tell you at the end
10:40
of that six thousand years
10:42
that's Christ time for him to rule and
10:44
reign on this earth but right now it's
10:46
our time what do you have to do right
10:48
now get the darkness out of you as an
10:51
active you will loose that darkness from
10:53
your soul and ask God to fill your soul
10:55
be the light of God fill it with the
10:57
word of God sit in soap and anointed
11:00
worship music and just begin to adore
11:01
him
11:02
you'll feel his presence I promise you
11:04
he wants you more than you want him but
11:09
you have been calling for a holy time on
11:11
this earth and I know that it's an
11:14
important thing to have the grace of God
11:16
but why trample on his blood I would
11:19
wear the Kiryat on the inside of me and
11:22
shake hell and stand here and say
11:26
there's no darkness in me and by the
11:29
right now I speak against the darkness
11:31
trying to consume your body trying to
11:33
consume our government father in Jesus
11:36
name I declare you will she'll be done
11:40
on this earth as it is in heaven and
11:42
right now I say darkness your food from
11:45
God's people but let's you know open
11:48
their eyes right now just reach out
11:49
receive it brother open their eyes let
11:51
them see the EM scene let them open
11:54
their ears
11:55
here you speak to them so they'll know
11:57
who they are
11:58
we are the monarchy of the heaven you're
12:02
considered royalty you are kings and
12:04
priests unto your God
12:06
Kings don't grovel they rule where God
12:10
placed them get ready to rule in this
12:13
world and make a difference like the
12:15
body of Christ never has before
12:17
which side of the line are you gonna
12:18
step on beyond those living in fear and
12:21
rule
12:22
running to hide in the hills are you
12:24
gonna stand with the glory of God and
12:26
get ready to make a difference in this
12:27
world we have a long season left on this
12:30
earth and let me give you a clue at the
12:32
end of the six thousand years that's
12:34
when the tribulation takes place because
12:36
at the end of the tribulation Jesus sits
12:38
on the throne in Jerusalem and let me
12:40
tell you you better be standing with
12:42
Jerusalem God still calls him his chosen
12:45
people there are signs of the Jewish
12:47
race all over in heaven God honors them
12:50
highly and let me tell you this and the
12:54
country by way of God said they try to
12:56
raise their ugly head hey we'll take it
12:59
off

05:38
DAVID, WELL, AND MY
05:41
FRIEND, AND OUR FRIEND,
05:43
AND SHE HAS JUST BEEN AND
05:46
WE HAVE NOT SEEN HER THAT
05:48
MUCH, BUT SHE IS SUCH A
05:49
BLESSING TO US. YOU ARE A
05:53
BLESSING. AND SHE HAS GOT
05:53
PINK HAIR.
05:58
>>JANE:AND I KNOW THAT
05:59
WOULD BE A REASON, AND WE
05:59
CAN GET IT OUT OF THE
06:00
WHERE AND SHARE THE
06:01
BACKGROUND.
06:02
>>GUEST: AND YOU COULD
06:03
NOT MAKE IT UP AND NUMBER
06:05
1, AND THE LORD WANTED ME
06:06
TO DO THIS AND PEOPLE ARE
06:09
SHOCKED AND THEY WILL SAY,
06:12
AND GOD HAS USED DONKEYS
06:13
TO SPEAK FOR HIM, AND HE
06:16
USES PEOPLE TO SPEAK FOR
06:17
HIM, AND IF YOU ARE
06:18
WILLING TO LET ME TELL YOU
06:21
AND PEOPLE SAY GOD WON'T
06:21
DO THAT, BUT I WOULD
06:24
RATHER HAVE THIS THAT
06:24
CAMEL'S HAIR. I REMEMBER
06:26
THE MAN AND HE WORE CAMEL
06:29
HAIR AND THAT BROUGHT
06:30
ATTENTION, AND THAT WAS
06:33
NOT NORMAL AND THIS IS
06:33
SMELLY AND ITCHY. AND SO
06:35
PINK CARE WOULD BE BETTER.
06:39
AND SO, THE LORD SAYS,
06:40
THIS IS NECESSARY AND THE
06:42
WORLD IS DRAWN TO THIS
06:43
PINK CARE, AND I SHARE
06:45
ABOUT GOD AND HEAVEN AND
06:48
THE PEOPLE ARE CAPTIVATED
06:49
AND THEY CANNOT BELIEVE IT
06:53
THAT I KNOW GOD WITH PINK
06:53
CARE BUT WHAT THIS DOES, I
06:55
AM NOT JUDGING THEM AND
06:56
THEY KNOW AND HIM AND WHAT
06:57
THEY LOOK LIKE I AM NOT
06:59
JUDGING THEM, AND I'M NOT
07:02
JUDGING THEM AT ALL. I
07:06
SPEAK TO THEM LIKE THEY
07:06
KNOW JESUS AND THIS IS
07:07
WHAT HE TOLD ME TO DO, I
07:09
WAS NOT THIS TYPE OF
07:09
PERSON. I WAS IN THE
07:12
BUSINESS WORLD FOR MANY
07:12
YEARS, AND I WOULD SAY,
07:17
AND WHEN JESUS COMES INTO
07:17
PERSON AND HE WANTS TO
07:18
KNOW, I WAS THIS WAY
07:19
GROWING UP AND HE CAME
07:23
THROUGH THE WALL MY HOME,
07:24
AND HE SAT ON MY LOVE SEAT,
07:26
AND I LOVE THAT HE
07:26
PICKED THAT SEAT, AND HE
07:30
WANTED ME TO WRITE BOOKS
07:30
AND GO AROUND THE WORLD.
07:33
AND HE SAID, YOU CAN HAVE
07:34
PINK HIGHLIGHTS, AND IN
07:37
MY MIND, I WAS THINKING,
07:37
BUT WHAT? AND I HAVE
07:40
NEVER HEARD ANYTHING LIKE
07:43
THIS, AND GOD READ ME AND
07:45
GOD KNOWS MY THOUGHTS, AND
07:48
GOD TOLD ME THIS WAS
07:49
NECESSARY AND SO HE SAYS THIS,
07:51
I DID NOT CARE WHAT HE MIGHT
07:52
HAVE SAID, AND WHEN THE WORLD
07:55
SEES, AND THAT YOU GOT
07:56
PINK CARE AND YOU HAVE,
08:00
THE LORD, AND YOU ARE
08:00
FILLED WITH ME AND YOU
08:01
SPEAK ABOUT ME AND LOVE
08:03
AND HE SAYS, THEY WILL
08:04
LISTEN TO YOU AND HE WAS
08:09
RIGHT AND I'VE GOT
08:10
MEETINGS EVERYWHERE I GO
08:10
IN THE RESTAURANTS OR THE
08:11
GROCERY STORES, AND AT
08:11
THE GAS STATION AND PEOPLE
08:14
COMMENT ABOUT MY HAIR AND
08:17
I SAY, I AM A MINISTER AND
08:18
I TALK ABOUT HEAVEN, AND
08:18
THEY, AND THEY COULD BE
08:23
SHOCKED RIGHT THERE AND
08:23
MAYBE THEY ARE CERTAIN
08:24
DENOMINATIONS, AND MAYBE
08:26
THEY DON'T THINK I WOULD
08:27
BELONG TO JESUS, BUT
08:30
JESUS HAS MADE THE RAINBOW
08:30
AND THIS IS HIS, AND THE
08:33
COLORS AND EVERYTHING,
08:36
AND THAT ARE ANIMALS THAT
08:36
CAN CHANGE COLOR, AND
08:38
THIS WOULD BE HIS HOME,
08:43
AND IT REALLY IS AND HE
08:44
WANTED ME TO DO THIS AND I
08:44
DID OBEY AND IT WOULD BE
08:45
THAT SIMPLE, AND MY LIFE
08:46
IS NOT BEEN THE SAME. I
08:50
HAVE BROUGHT MORE PEOPLE
08:51
TO THE LORD WITH MY PINK
08:51
CARE SINCE 2006 THEN ALL
08:52
MY YEARS PRIOR, I HAVE
08:56
KNOWN JESUS SINCE I WAS 4
08:57
AND I'M 64 NOW, AND I
08:59
HAVE KNOWN HIM FOR SO
09:00
LONG. I NEVER HAD
09:02
SOMETHING LIKE THIS LIKE
09:05
THIS DOES AND MAYBE YOU
09:05
COULD GO FOR THIS IF YOU
09:07
ARE OVER 50, AND YOU
09:09
COULD GET YOUR HIGHLIGHTS,
09:12
AND I PROMISE YOU, YOU
09:12
COULD BRING THE PEOPLE IN,
09:14
THAT WOULD BE THE LIGHT
09:14
IN YOU.
09:16
>>BOB: THAT IS SO
09:18
INTERESTING. NOW, AND
09:22
WHEN, AND WHEN I WAS
09:25
YOUNG, I WAS PROBABLY 18,
09:28
AND THE LORD TOOK ME TO
09:29
HEAVEN.
09:32
>>GUEST: I KNOW. I CAN
09:35
SEE THIS ALL OVER YOU.
09:38
AND WHEN YOU SPEAK ABOUT
09:40
HEAVEN, AND THE GLORY
09:40
COMES OUT OF YOUR MOUTH,
09:43
AND IT IS LIKE A LIGHT AND
09:44
THIS IS WHAT I SEE AND I
09:44
CAN FEEL IT, I CAN FEEL
09:45
IT.
09:47
>>JANE:
09:48
>>BOB: IT IS NOT SOMETHING
09:48
THAT I CAN TALK ABOUT.
09:53
BUT I'VE NEVER HAD ANOTHER
09:54
EXPERIENCE. AND YOU,
09:58
AND YOU GO THERE ALL OF
09:58
THE TIME.
09:59
>>GUEST: I HAVE A
10:01
COMMISSION AND GOD GAVE ME
10:05
A COMMISSION AND HE SAYS,
10:06
AND THE FATHER WOULD TAKE
10:06
ME ON A TOUR OF HEAVEN AND
10:08
THAT WAS IN 1996, AND
10:11
THERE WAS A PURPOSE FOR IT
10:12
AND I SAID YES AND YOU
10:15
KNOW AND I HAVE KNOWN THE
10:16
LORD SINCE I WAS 4 YEARS
10:16
OF AGE, I HAVE SERVED HIM
10:18
ALL MY LIFE, I HAVE MADE
10:21
MY MISTAKES AND I WAS NOT
10:22
PERFECT IN ANY WAY, BUT I
10:23
DID REPENT A LOT. AND MY
10:26
FATHER WAS A MISSIONARY,
10:28
AND I WAS RAISED ON THESE
10:31
FOUNDATIONS OF HOLINESS
10:32
AND THE LOVE OF GOD. AND
10:36
WE WERE NOT PERFECT BUT WE
10:37
KNEW THAT GOD LOVED US,
10:39
AND THIS WOULD BE SO
10:41
IMPORTANT, I CAN RELATE
10:42
SO WELL TO THE FATHER'S.
10:44
I HAD A WONDERFUL EARTHLY
10:46
FATHER. AND YOUR REAL
10:48
FATHER IS IN HEAVEN, AND
10:50
HE WANTS YOU TO KNOW HIM,
10:52
AND SO I HAD A COMMISSION,
10:57
AND I HAD BEEN REMOVED
10:58
FROM MY WONDERFUL JOB, I
10:59
HAD A LAW FIRM, I HAD A
11:02
WONDERFUL SALARY, AND
11:05
THEY SAID WE CAN SPEND THE
11:05
NEXT YEARS PREPARING YOU
11:07
FOR YOUR NEXT ASSIGNMENT.
11:13
I HAD MEANT TO GET
11:13
COUNTERS WITH THE LORD AND
11:14
THE HOLY SPIRIT BEGAN TO
11:14
SHOW ME REVELATION OF THE
11:15
WORD, AND GOD WAS
11:17
TOUCHING MY LIFE AND SEND
11:18
ME OUT AND ASSIGNMENTS,
11:22
AND MAYBE WHEN I WOULD GO
11:23
TO THE AIRPORT I WOULD GO
11:23
TO A FOOD COURT AND GIVE A
11:25
CERTAIN PERSON A WORD.
11:31
AND THEY WERE TRAINING ME
11:31
TO GO AND WHATEVER THEY
11:32
WANTED ME TO DO AND AT THE
11:32
END OF THE 3 YEARS, AND
11:34
GOD CAME THROUGH MY HOME
11:34
AND HE SAID SIT DOWN, AND
11:39
THE FATHER AND I WILL TAKE
11:40
YOU ON A TOUR OF HEAVEN
11:40
AND THIS IS WHAT WE WERE
11:41
PREPARED FOR. I HAD TO
11:43
GIVE UP EVERYTHING AND
11:43
TRUST THE LORD. AND I HAD
11:45
TO TRUST THE LORD. AND
11:49
WHEN YOU DO SOMETHING
11:50
SIGNIFICANT FOR GOD YOU
11:50
KNOW THERE IS A PRICE TO
11:51
PAY, AND THERE ARE A LOT
11:53
OF SACRIFICES YOU MAKE AND
11:54
IT IS SO WORTH IT. AND
11:59
THEY TOOK ME TO HEAVEN
11:59
FROM THAT DAY FORWARD AND
12:00
THEY DO NOT STOP NOW. AND
12:03
I HAVE SEEN SO MANY
12:03
DIFFERENT THINGS ON
12:03
PURPOSE. AND THEY WANT
12:07
THE WORLD, TO KNOW WHAT
12:07
HEAVEN IS REALLY LIKE,
12:10
AND THAT THE HOUSE OF GOD
12:11
IS LIKE A WORLD. AND YOU
12:13
KNOW AND MAYBE WOULD BE
12:14
MAYBE A BUILDING. AND THE
12:19
BIBLE SAYS IN MY FATHER'S
12:19
HOUSE WOULD BE MANY
12:20
MANSIONS, AND MAYBE
12:22
PEOPLE SEE THIS INSIDE OF
12:22
A BUILDING, AND HE IS THE
12:24
GREAT CREATOR, AND
12:29
EVERYTHING IS MADE AND IT
12:29
WOULD BE LIKE A WORLD
12:30
BIGGER THAN THE UNIVERSE.
12:31
AND THAT WOULD BE PLENTY
12:32
OF ROOM, I HAVE SEEN THE
12:35
MANSIONS, IT WAS LIKE A
12:38
CITY AND IT BELONGED TO
12:38
PROBABLY A MISSIONARY.
12:40
AND SO, YES.
12:42
>>JANE: AND WE HAVE THE
12:44
PEOPLE THAT LOST LOVED
12:45
ONES AND THEY LOVE JESUS,
12:47
AND THEY KNOW THEY ARE IN
12:47
HEAVEN, WE HAVE SOME
12:49
FRIENDS WE KNOW. AND WHAT
12:53
HAPPENS AS SOON AS YOU ARE
12:53
BORN AGAIN, AND YOU LOVE
12:57
JESUS AND YOUR SPIRIT
12:57
LEAVES YOUR BODY BUT WHAT
12:58
HAPPENS?
12:58
>>GUEST: YES, IT DOES AND
13:01
MAYBE LET'S SAY, LET ME
13:02
BACK UP, AND YOU KNOW AND
13:05
THE LORD DID TAKE ME AND I
13:08
WAS PRESENT WHEN SOMEBODY
13:08
PASSED AWAY, AND THEN I
13:12
COULD FOLLOW THEM IN THE
13:12
SPIRIT TO SEE WHAT
13:12
HAPPENED. AND I CAN SHARE
13:14
IN DETAIL WHAT THEY WERE
13:18
SHOWING ME AND WHAT I WAS
13:19
ABLE TO SEE THAT PEOPLE
13:19
COULD NO. IT WOULD BE A
13:20
BEAUTIFUL THING. AND
13:24
MAYBE THEY WERE SICK OR
13:24
HANDICAPPED AND VERY OLD,
13:29
AND WHEN YOUR SPIRITUAL
13:30
BODY, AND WHEN YOU HAVE
13:30
YOUR BODY, OKAY? WE ARE A
13:32
SPIRIT 1ST, RIGHT? AND
13:35
THEN YOU HAVE YOUR SPIRIT,
13:37
AND THIS WOULD BE FROM THE
13:38
TIME OF CONCEPTION, AND
13:42
THIS WOULD BE SOMETHING
13:43
THAT WAS ATTACHED TO YOUR
13:44
FLESH. AND THEY HAVE
13:46
FOUND OUT, AND WHEN
13:50
CONCEPTION HAPPENS, THERE
13:50
WOULD BE A FLASH OF LIGHT,
13:53
AND THEY CANNOT EXPLAIN
13:53
IT AT THE CONCEPTION. AND
13:55
THAT IS THE HOLY SPIRIT,
13:59
AND THIS IS WHAT HE DOES
13:59
AND YOU ARE MADE OF LIFE.
14:01
YOU ARE MADE OUT OF LIGHT.
14:07
AND I WAS ASTOUNDED MANY
14:08
YEARS AGO, WE HAD FOUND
14:08
OUT, THE TIME OF
14:09
CONCEPTION, AND WE DON'T
14:11
KNOW WHAT THE FLASH OF
14:11
LIGHT IS BUT I COULD TELL
14:12
THEM. AND THAT WOULD BE
14:16
AN EVIDENCE THAT IT
14:16
HAPPENS, AND SO FROM THIS
14:17
TIME ONWARD, YOUR
14:20
SPIRITUAL BODY BEGINS TO
14:21
GROW INSIDE OF THE LITTLE,
14:22
AND FOR THE WOMB OF THE
14:23
MOTHER. AND ONE THING,
14:27
ALSO, AND WE WERE INSIDE
14:28
OF GOD, AND YOU KNOW
14:34
THAT GOD CARRIED IS, AND
14:35
GOD CARRIED US INSIDE OF
14:35
HIMSELF, AND WE ARE SENT
14:36
OUT OF HIM, AND ADAM HE
14:40
WAS TAKEN OUT OF GOD INTO
14:43
HIS NOSTRILS AND WHEN HE
14:43
MADE THE BODY, HE GAVE
14:45
GOD INTO HIMSELF, AND IT
14:50
SAYS, AND WE HAD OUR VERY
14:50
BEING IN HIM. AND THIS IS
14:52
WHERE WE CAME FROM. AND
14:55
WE ARE IN THE RIVER OF
14:55
LIFE, AND THE LORD SAYS,
14:59
I HAVE WATER IN THE WOMB,
15:03
BECAUSE THIS WOULD BE
15:03
FAMILIAR AND HOW ABOUT
15:04
THAT? AND THIS WOULD BE
15:05
FROM REVELATION. AND YES
15:08
AND FROM THE TIME YOU DIE,
15:09
AND YOUR BODY, AND THIS
15:12
IS NOT AGING, AND MAYBE
15:13
YOUR LASHES AGING, BUT THE
15:16
REAL YOU IS NOT AGING, AND
15:20
YOU WILL LOOK LIKE YOU
15:20
WOULD BE IN YOUR TWENTIES
15:21
WHEN YOU STEP OUT OF YOUR
15:21
BODY, AND WHEN YOU COME
15:23
OUT OF THE BODY, AND YOU
15:26
WOULD HAVE THE LOVE OF GOD
15:27
AND THE LIFE OF GOD, AND
15:30
YOU CAN SEE YOUR GUARDIAN
15:30
ANGELS FOR THE 1ST TIME,
15:32
AND THEY WILL TAKE YOU TO
15:36
HEAVEN, AND THEN YOU
15:37
WOULD BE PICKED UP AND
15:37
I'VE SEEN THE TRANSPORTS,
15:38
AND PEOPLE OF LEFT IN
15:39
CHARIOTS, AND JESUS CAN
15:41
PICK YOU UP HIMSELF. IF
15:44
YOU HAVE A VERY CLOSE
15:45
RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM.
15:48
AND YOU COULD GO BACK TO
15:48
HEAVEN AND YOU WILL GO TO
15:52
HEAVEN, AND NOBODY STAYS
15:52
HERE AND YOU CANNOT STAY
15:53
HERE, AND YOU WOULD GO
15:54
ONE PLACE OR THE OTHER, I
15:57
HAVE SEEN HELL BUT WANT TO
15:57
TALK ABOUT HEAVEN. AND
16:01
YOU WOULD GO THROUGH THE
16:02
UNIVERSE AND YOU WOULD SEE
16:02
THE MOST BEATABLE THINGS,
16:04
ALL OF THE PLANETS, THE
16:05
NEBULAE, AND THEN YOU
16:06
CONCEDE HEAVEN, AND YOU
16:10
WOULD BE IN YOUR SPIRITUAL
16:11
BODY SO YOUR EYES WOULD BE
16:11
OPENED, IT WOULD BE THE
16:13
MOST BEAUTIFUL THING AND
16:15
THE LIGHT IS BLASTING OUT
16:18
INTO NOTHINGNESS AND
16:19
MILLIONS OF ANGELS, AND GO
16:21
FROM THIS PLACE ALL OF
16:21
THE TIME, AND IT WOULD BE
16:23
LIKE STREAMING, AND MAYBE
16:26
1000 ANGELS, AND JUST
16:29
SPINNING IN THE ATMOSPHERE
16:31
AND THEIR GLORIFYING GOD
16:32
AND WORSHIPING GOD, THE
16:35
SERAPHIM COME FROM OVER
16:36
THE THRONE, AND LIKE THE
16:41
BLUE FIRE, THEY WOULD HAVE
16:41
THE FIRE OF GOD, IT WOULD
16:42
BE LIKE THEY ARE ON FIRE,
16:44
AND YOU ARE ASTOUNDED AT
16:45
THE BEAUTY AND THE
16:46
SPLENDOR GOING UP TO
16:47
HEAVEN, AND THEY WOULD BE
16:49
A PLACE FOR YOU DISEMBARK
16:51
AND MAYBE YOU WOULD GET
16:52
OFF OF A SHIP. AND YOU
16:54
CAN SEE THE OTHER PEOPLE
16:56
GETTING OFF OF THE
16:59
CHARIOTS AND YOUR FAMILY,
16:59
AND THEY CAN BE AT THE
17:01
GATE AND THAT WOULD BE
17:02
AWAY, AND YOU CAN SEE THE
17:03
RIVER OF LIFE, AND THIS
17:06
FLOWS OUT OF HEAVEN AND
17:09
PEOPLE THROW THE WATER ON
17:10
EACH OTHER AND JUMPING IN,
17:11
AND NOT JUST YOUR FAMILY
17:13
BUT YOUR PETS WILL MEET
17:13
YOU, AND WE MIGHT AS WELL
17:16
GO THERE AND BECAUSE GOD
17:18
SAYS, AND BECAUSE YOU
17:19
LOVE THEM AND WHEN HE MADE
17:21
ADAM, HE HAD THE ANIMALS
17:25
AND WE ARE NOT MEANT FOR
17:25
LABOR, AND THEY SHOULD BE
17:27
OUR COMPANIONS. AND
17:32
OUTGOING TO THAT LATER BUT
17:32
ANYWAY, THE PETS GO TO
17:33
HEAVEN, AND IT SAYS, FROM
17:39
GENESIS, AND GOD TOOK ME
17:39
BACK TO THE WORD, AND
17:40
ABOUT THE PETS GOING TO
17:41
HEAVEN AND HE SAYS TO
17:45
NOAH, AND HE HAD THE
17:45
SPIRIT OF LIFE AND THEM,
17:47
AND THIS WAS A SPIRITUAL
17:50
BODY AND SO WHEN YOUR PET
17:56
DIES, AND WHEN YOU'RE
17:56
ANGELS WILL TAKE YOU TO
17:57
HEAVEN, YOU WILL GO TO
17:57
YOUR MANSION, AND YOU
17:59
WILL NOT MAKE A MESS IN
17:59
YOUR MANSION. AND I HAVE
18:03
SEEN THIS PLACE WHEN THEY
18:06
DISEMBARK, AND THEY WILL
18:06
GRAB YOU AND HUG YOU, AND
18:08
THEY WILL LOVE YOU, AND
18:11
THEN YOU WOULD BE TAKEN
18:11
INTO THE THRONE ROOM, AND
18:14
IF THEY COULD GET YOU OUT
18:14
OF THE RIVER OF LIFE. AND
18:18
SOMETIMES JESUS IS IN THE
18:18
RIVER OF LIFE, AND HE
18:20
SPLASHES WATER ON YOU,
18:23
AND YOU WILL LAUGH LIKE
18:23
CHILDREN AND YOU WILL
18:24
LAUGH AND LAUGH AND YOU
18:27
WILL BE OVERWHELMED AT THE
18:27
BEAUTY AND THE FLOWERS
18:29
SINGING AND THE COLORS
18:29
WOULD BE MOVING, AND
18:32
THERE IS SO MUCH GLORIOUS
18:34
MUSIC AND YOU CONCEDE THE
18:35
GLORY, AND YOU CAN SEE
18:40
THE GLORY OF GOD ALL OVER
18:40
THIS PLACE AND IT IS SUCH
18:41
A BEAUTIFUL THING. AND
18:45
THEN YOU COULD GO INTO THE
18:45
GATES, AND INTO THE THRONE
18:46
ROOM OF GOD AND JESUS WILL
18:49
TAKE YOU HIMSELF, AND BACK
18:50
UP THE STEPS AND YOU'LL BE
18:52
GIVEN BACK TO THE FATHER,
18:56
AND WHEN HE SAYS HE WOULD
18:56
SHOW YOU THIS, AND JESUS
18:59
WAS GIVEN A REWARD FOR HIS
19:00
CROSS, BUT HE TOOK EACH
19:03
PERSON BACK UP THE STEPS
19:03
TO THE FATHER AND WHEN
19:06
THEY CAME HOME AND HE GAVE
19:07
THEM BACK TO THE FATHER.
19:10
AND HE SAYS I AM THE ONLY
19:10
WAY BACK TO THE FATHER.
19:12
AND HE MEANS IT LITERALLY.
19:15
AND WHEN YOU RECEIVE IT
19:15
AND I'LL SAY AND THERE IS
19:17
JUST ONE WAY TO HEAVEN, AND
19:21
THAT WOULD BE THROUGH
19:21
CHRIST AND THAT WOULD BE
19:22
NO OTHER WAY OR ENTRANCE,
19:23
IT IS HIS BLOOD, AND THAT
19:27
WOULD WIPE THE SIN OUT OF
19:28
YOU AND THAT WILL MAKE YOU
19:28
ACCEPTABLE TO GOD, AND
19:31
GOD SAYS, THAT YOU CAN
19:31
EXPLAIN TO THE PEOPLE,
19:35
AND THEY SAY THAT GOD
19:35
WON'T SEND YOU TO HELL,
19:39
BUT I SAY THE BLOOD IS NOT
19:40
MET BECAUSE YOU GO TO HELL
19:43
AND YOU WILL BUT IF YOU
19:43
DON'T RECEIVE THIS, BUT I
19:46
WILL PUT THE BLOOD OF
19:47
CHRIST ON YOU, BUT IF
19:49
ANYBODY GOES TO HEAVEN
19:50
WITHOUT CHRIST, HEAVEN
19:51
WOULD BE LIKE THE EARTH.
19:55
AND YOU CAN SAY, I CANNOT
19:56
ALLOW THIS, AND YOU WILL
19:57
BE WASHED OF ALL OF YOUR
19:59
EVIL. AND JESUS WILL TAKE
20:02
YOU BACK UP THE STAIRWELL
20:03
TO HEAVEN, AND THERE IS
20:04
SUCH CELEBRATION, AND THE
20:08
THRONE IS SO HUGE, AND I
20:11
HAVE BEEN IN THERE AND I
20:12
COULD NOT SEE THE CEILING,
20:14
AND THE GLORY OVER THE
20:15
THRONE, AND THERE ARE THE
20:18
SERAPHIM AND THEY ARE
20:18
LIVING CREATURES, AND
20:22
THEY WILL BE FILLING YOU
20:22
WITH AMAZEMENT AND THEY
20:23
ARE HUGE, AND THEY HAVE
20:24
EYES THROUGHOUT THEIR
20:28
ODDITIES LIKE REVELATION 4
20:28
AND WHAT JOHN WAS SEEING
20:32
AND THIS IS SO MUCH AND
20:33
YOU ARE UNDONE, AND YOU
20:36
SEE THE WATER FLOWING DOWN
20:37
THE STEPS AND YOU SEE THE
20:40
THRONE, AND THE THRONE IS
20:41
HIGH AND LIFTED UP, AND I
20:44
KNOW THE PEOPLE THAT WERE
20:44
CAUGHT UP, AND YOU KNOW,
20:48
IT WOULD BE LIKE THE
20:48
ENTIRE CRYSTAL SEA, AND I
20:50
COULD MAKE, I CAN SEE
20:53
WHERE YOU WOULD BE UNDONE.
20:56
AND YOU HAVE THE GLORIOUS
20:57
MOUNTAINS AND THE
20:58
GEMSTONES, AND YOU WOULD
20:58
BE LIKE, THIS WOULD BE
21:02
LIKE BEAUTIFUL MOUNTAINS
21:03
OF FIRE 10 STORIES TALL,
21:04
AND PEOPLE SAY, AND WHY
21:07
WOULD BE OUTSIDE? AND HE
21:09
COULD HAVE MORE THAN ONE
21:12
THRONE, AND HE HAS MORE
21:12
THAN ONE THRONE AND HE CAN
21:13
AFFORD IT. AND THEN YOU
21:15
SEE THE GLORY WHEN YOU GO
21:16
UP THE STEPS, AND YOU SEE
21:18
THE FATHER REACHING OUT.
21:21
AND HE WILL HOLD YOU TO
21:23
HIMSELF, AND YOU DO NOT
21:24
WANT TO LEAVE, AND YOU
21:25
WILL KNOW WHAT YOU ARE
21:27
FEELING, AND THIS WOULD
21:29
BE NO LOVE LIKE YOU'VE
21:30
EVER KNOWN IN YOUR LIFE.
21:34
IT WOULD CONSUME EVERY
21:35
PART OF YOUR LIFE AND THIS
21:35
WOULD BE A WELCOME HOME
21:37
PARTY. AND THIS WOULD BE
21:37
SO GLORIOUS, AND YOU CAN
21:42
KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THAT
21:42
YOU CAME FROM HIM AND YOU
21:43
KNOW YOU WOULD BE HOME,
21:45
THIS WOULD BE A TEMPORARY
21:45
PLACE BUT THIS IS HOME.
21:48
OUR CITIZENSHIP IS IN
21:51
HEAVEN AND SO WE ALL HAVE
21:52
THESE THINGS, AND MY SON
21:57
AND MY DAUGHTER THEY HAVE
21:57
COME HOME THEY WILL SAY,
22:01
AND THEY WILL GIVE YOU
22:02
CERTAIN REWARDS AND
22:02
EVERYBODY CELEBRATES AND
22:03
THEY DANCE AND YOU HAVE
22:03
THE WELCOME HOME PARTY,
22:07
AND YOU DON'T GET A SMALL
22:07
PARTY IN HEAVEN, AND
22:10
EVERYBODY WATCHES THEIR
22:11
FUNERAL ON THE EARTH, AND
22:16
THEY WILL SAY FUNNY
22:16
THINGS, AND MAYBE HAVE THE
22:17
HAPPY SONGS, AND I SAY
22:18
LOOK UP, AND IT DOES NOT
22:22
MATTER WHAT PEOPLE ARE
22:22
THINKING THEY ARE WATCHING
22:24
YOU, AND THEY ARE GLAD
22:25
THAT YOU REMEMBER YOUR
22:26
LIFE ON THE EARTH, AND
22:29
THERE IS AN ENTIRELY NEW
22:29
WAY TO LIVE NOW. JESUS
22:31
AND THE FATHER.
22:32
>>BOB: AND YOU WERE
22:34
SAYING IT IS A PARTY, AND
22:37
YOU WERE SAYING, AND
22:38
EMPLOYEE, WHO JUST WENT
22:40
HOME TO BE WITH THE LORD.
22:42
AND THIS IS WHAT HE TOLD
22:42
THE FAMILY, AND JUST TO
22:45
HAVE THAT PARTY. BECAUSE,
22:49
AND I DON'T KNOW IF HE HAD
22:49
THE GLIMPSE OF THE PARTY
22:51
THAT HE WOULD BE HAVING,
22:52
OR NOT.
22:52
>>JANE: HE HAD SUCH A
22:54
SENSE OF HUMOR.
22:56
>>GUEST: AND YES, HE WILL
22:57
HAVE A GREAT TIME.
22:59
>>JANE: HE HAD A GREAT
23:00
SENSE OF HUMOR. AND THERE
23:03
IS A BOOK AND THIS IS
23:03
CALLED REVEALING HEAVEN,
23:07
AND THIS WILL REVEAL THIS
23:07
WOULD BE IT ON YOUR
23:10
SCREEN. AND YES, AND YOU
23:12
CANNOT PUT THIS DOWN.
23:14
>>GUEST: AND YOU AND
23:17
SOMETIMES I READ THE BOOK
23:18
MYSELF AND THEY BECOME
23:18
EXCITED MYSELF. AND THIS
23:22
WOULD BE HIS REVELATION,
23:22
AND THIS DOES TOUCH ME
23:26
AND I'VE GOT THE CDS AND
23:29
DVDS, AND SOME OF THESE
23:30
THINGS WOULD NOT BE IN MY
23:32
BOOK AND I'VE GOT TO THIS
23:33
REVELATION BEFORE I WROTE
23:34
THE BOOK AND EVEN
23:35
AFTERWARDS, I WOULD
23:36
BECOME SO EXCITED, AND I
23:39
NEED TO KNOW, I NEED TO LET
23:41
THE PEOPLE KNOW WHO
23:42
THEY ARE IN CHRIST.
23:42
>>JANE: WE WILL BE TAKING
23:47
A BREAK AND SHE'LL BE
23:48
TALKING ABOUT WHAT THE
23:48
LORD HAS DONE RECENTLY FOR
23:49
HER. AND YES WE ARE
23:50
EXCITED.

24:36
COURAGE OF PETER AND JOHN
24:36
AND THEY SAW THAT THEY
24:38
WERE UNSCHOOLED AND
24:38
ORDINARY MEN THEY WERE
24:40
ASTONISHED AND THEY TOOK

AND JOHN AND SHOW THE COURAGE

APPLAUSE
28:44
APPLAUSE
28:45
>>BOB: THANK YOU DAVID,
28:49
ALWAYS WE APPRECIATE THE
28:49
GOOD MUSIC, AND BY THE
28:53
WAY, HAVEN'T IS FILLED
28:56
WITH MUSIC.
28:57
AND IS THAT TRUE?
28:57
>>GUEST: ABSOLUTELY AND
29:01
EVEN THE FLOWERS, THE
29:02
FLOWER SING, AND THE
29:04
CLOTHING WILL MAKE MUSIC,
29:07
AND THAT WOULD BE REAL
29:07
GARMENTS OF PRAISE IN
29:09
HEAVEN AND THAT WOULD BE
29:10
IN THE WORD OF GOD, AND
29:14
SOME OF THE PEOPLE HAVE
29:14
THIS AS A REWARD, AND WE
29:15
SAW THIS HAPPENING, AND
29:20
THE FATHER, HE WAS
29:20
REWARDING SOMEONE FOR
29:20
USING THEIR GIFT, AND
29:24
LOVING THE PEOPLE THROUGH
29:25
THE SONGS AND THIS IS WHAT
29:25
THEY DID, AND HE GOT A
29:27
LITTLE TREASURE CHEST,
29:30
AND HE SAYS OUT GIVE YOU
29:30
THE GARMENT OF PRAISE. IT
29:31
WAS SMALL, HOWEVER IT WAS
29:34
LIKE, IT WAS ALIVE IT
29:36
WOULD BE HARD TO EXPLAIN
29:39
AND LIFE IS EVERYWHERE IN
29:39
HEAVEN. AND I CAN SEE THE
29:42
MUSIC AND I COULD SEE THE
29:43
SONGS, AND THAT WOULD BE
29:44
STRANGE. YOU CAN SEE THE
29:47
MUSIC AND YOU DON'T JUST
29:47
HEAR IT OR FEEL IT BUT YOU
29:49
CAN SEE IT. I SAW A
29:51
BEAUTIFUL SONG IT WAS LIKE
29:53
A LOVELY COLOR, AND THIS
29:56
BECAME A BEAUTIFUL GOWN,
30:00
AND SHE WAS OVERWHELMED
30:01
AND WHEN SHE WOULD MOVE
30:03
HER HAND, YOU COULD HEAR
30:03
THE MUSIC OUT OF THE
30:07
GARMENT, YOU CAN HAVE THE
30:07
GARMENT OF PRAISE AS YOUR
30:08
REWARD. AND EVEN YOUR
30:10
CLOTHING WILL WORSHIP GOD
30:14
AND THAT WOULD BE SO MANY
30:14
FORMS OF MUSIC AND THAT
30:15
WOULD BE ONE, AND MAYBE
30:16
WOULD HEAR THE HEAVENLY
30:17
CHOIR SINGING, IT SOUNDS
30:20
LIKE MILLIONS OF VOICES
30:20
WORKING TOGETHER, AND
30:22
THERE WERE INSTRUMENTS
30:24
THAT I NEVER HAVE SEEN ON
30:24
THE EARTH, AND YOU WILL
30:26
BE DELIGHTED AND AMAZED
30:28
AND WHEN YOU GO TO HEAVEN.
30:30
AND MUSIC IS ALL OVER
30:31
HEAVEN. AND THE WALLS
30:33
MAKE MUSIC IN THE
30:39
MANSIONS, AND YOU WILL
30:39
WALK IN THE DOOR OF YOUR
30:40
MANSION, AND THERE COULD
30:43
BE FLOWERS GROWING OUT OF
30:43
THE WALLS IF YOU LIKE
30:44
THAT. AND SOMETIMES THEY
30:47
SAY WELCOME HOME AND SING
30:47
TO YOU. AND WORSHIP IS
30:49
ALL OVER HEAVEN, AND THE
30:53
SERAPHIM ARE SINGING AND
30:53
THIS IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
30:54
MUSIC. AND I HAVE SEEN
30:56
THE IRIDESCENT BEINGS,
30:59
THEY WOULD STEP OUT OF THE
31:00
WATER AND THE WATER SINGS,
31:02
AND EVERYTHING IS
31:03
GLOWING, AND EVERYTHING
31:05
WORSHIPS JESUS IN HEAVEN.
31:07
>>BOB: AND WELL, AND
31:10
I'VE LEARNED SOMETHING,
31:13
AND JUST RECENTLY, I
31:15
LEARNED THIS ABOUT GOD
31:16
RECENTLY AND I ABOUT,
31:19
AND ABOUT HIS CREATION
31:21
AND ABOUT THE HEAVENS.
31:27
AND, AND THEY, AND HE, I
31:30
GUESS, HE, AND HE IS STILL
31:32
AND HE IS STILL CREATING.
31:35
AND THAT WOULD BE AN
31:36
AMAZING THING TO ME.
31:37
BECAUSE WE CAN SEE OUT,
31:40
AND WE CAN SEE OUT HUNDRED
31:43
OF MILLIONS OF
31:44
LIGHT-YEARS, AND EVEN
31:45
BEYOND THAT, BUT HE IS
31:48
CREATING. AND IS THAT NOT
31:51
AMAZING?
31:51
>>GUEST: YES, HE IS AND
31:54
ONE OF THE THINGS I DID
31:55
NOT SAY, AND WHEN YOU GO
31:59
UP TO THE THRONE AND IF
31:59
YOU LOOK DOWN, AND THE
32:02
STEPS AND YOU WILL SEE
32:02
CREATION TAKING PLACE IT
32:04
IS EVERYWHERE HE IS ALWAYS
32:07
CREATING NEW THINGS IN
32:08
HEAVEN ALL OF THE TIME AND
32:12
PEOPLE GO HOME TO HEAVEN,
32:12
HE WILL MAKE A SPECIAL
32:13
THING JUST FOR THEM AND HE
32:14
WILL MAKE SPECIAL PLACES
32:17
AND EVEN OUT IN THE
32:19
UNIVERSE HE IS ALWAYS
32:23
CREATING AND PEOPLE KNOW
32:23
THIS ABOUT THE NEBULAE,
32:25
AND THE BABY STARS, AND
32:27
THIS WOULD BE FOR THE BABY
32:28
STARS. AND I WAS LEARNING
32:31
THIS AND THE LORD TOLD ME
32:31
MANY YEARS AGO, AND HE
32:34
SAID, AND THERE WERE SMALL
32:35
LIGHTS, AND NOW THEY HAVE
32:39
DISCOVERED AND THEY CAN
32:39
EVEN SAY, AND THIS WOULD
32:44
BE LIKE A NEST FOR THE
32:45
BABY STARS AND THEY GROW
32:45
BRIGHTER, AND FINALLY
32:47
THEY LEAVE THE NEST AND
32:50
THEY WILL FLOAT OUT INTO
32:50
THE UNIVERSE. AND HE IS
32:51
SO GOOD. HE IS ALWAYS
32:55
CREATING AND THIS IS WHAT
32:56
HE DOES HE IS THE CREATOR.
32:58
AND WE CAN CREATE THINGS
33:01
WITHOUT WORDS, AND WE
33:05
HAVE SPRINGS OF LIVING
33:05
WATER WHEN WE SPEAK, AND
33:07
WE CAN RELEASE HOPE, AND
33:11
OUR WORDS ARE SO IMPORTANT
33:11
AND WHEN HE SPOKE, AND
33:14
THIS WOULD BE A GREAT
33:15
REVELATION I WANT TO SHARE
33:15
THIS, AND BECAUSE I KNOW
33:19
THE WORD SAYS FROM JOHN,
33:20
AND SPEAKING ABOUT THE
33:20
LORD AND THAT HE WAS THE
33:25
WORD AND THE WORD WAS WITH
33:26
GOD, THAT WOULD BE THE
33:26
FATHER, AND HE WAS GOD,
33:32
AND THERE WAS NOTHING THAT
33:33
WAS NOT MADE BY HIM, AND
33:33
THIS WOULD BE THE WORD AND
33:34
THAT IS JESUS, AND IT
33:38
SAYS THE WORD HAS CREATED,
33:41
AND I BELIEVE AND I KNOW
33:41
THE ANSWER AND I KNOW THAT
33:46
JESUS CAN STEP INSIDE OF
33:47
THE FATHER, AND HE SAYS
33:49
AND YOU AND ME, AND ALL
33:50
OF US, AND HE SAYS, YOU
33:54
CAN DO THIS WHEN YOU GO TO
33:57
HEAVEN AND YOU CAN STEP
33:57
INSIDE, AND THE HOLY
34:00
GHOST APPS INSIDE AND WE
34:00
ARE ONE. AND THAT WOULD
34:03
BE THE GOAL AND HE WANTS
34:04
US TO BE ONE. AND WHAT HE
34:08
DOES AND BEFORE JESUS CAME
34:09
AND BEFORE WE HAD THE
34:11
WORD, AND HE WOULD STEP
34:12
INSIDE OF THE FATHER, AND
34:14
THE FATHER WOULD SPEAK AND
34:15
WHATEVER HE SPOKE AND THE
34:18
WORD WOULD STEP OUT AND HE
34:18
COULD MAKE IT. AND THE
34:22
THING THAT HE WAS SHOWING
34:23
ME AND HOW HE MADE THE
34:23
PHYSICAL REALM AND THE
34:25
FATHER SPOKE AND THE
34:29
SPIRITUAL REALM HAS ALWAYS
34:29
EXISTED, AND THIS IS A
34:31
SPIRITUAL WORLD AND WHEN
34:34
HE IS READY TO CREATE THE
34:34
UNIVERSE, AND HE SPEAKS
34:37
ABOUT WHEN HE MAKES IT,
34:39
AND HE SPOKE AND THE
34:40
FATHER SPOKE AND THE WORD,
34:43
TOOK THE SCROLL, AND HE
34:46
TOOK IT AROUND THE REALM
34:46
A, AND THIS BECAME THE
34:49
PHYSICAL REALM AND THE
34:51
PLANETS WERE ON IT. AND
34:53
HE PUT THEM ON IT AND HE
34:57
SAYS UNTO ME I SPEAK ABOUT
34:57
THIS FROM THE WORD, AND AT
34:58
THE END, I WILL PUT THIS
35:01
AWAY LIKE AN OLD GARMENT,
35:03
AND I KNOW WHAT THE END
35:05
IS. AND THE WORD SAYS, HE
35:09
STRETCHED OUT OF THE
35:09
HEAVENS LIKE A CURTAIN.
35:12
AND THIS IS LIKE A SCROLL.
35:15
AND THIS IS LIKE WHAT THE
35:16
WORD SAYS, AND THE WORD
35:18
MAKES IT AND HE DOES IT.
35:19
>>JANE: AND GOT HIS BEEN
35:21
SPEAKING TO YOU, AND HE
35:24
SAID, YOU COULD SHARED
35:25
THIS ON THE PROGRAM TODAY.
35:26
AND WE WANT YOU TO TALK
35:27
ABOUT IT.
35:28
>>GUEST: AND YES AND I
35:29
WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE
35:32
TIME AND GOD HAS A
35:32
TIMELINE, AND GOD SHOWED
35:36
ME AND GOT HIS CREATED
35:37
TIME, CORRECT? AND THE
35:40
FATHER WOULD BE THE ONLY
35:41
ONE THAT HAS TIME IN HIS
35:43
HAND, AND YOU KNOW AND
35:47
JESUS DOES NOT KNOW WHAT
35:47
HE COULD COME BACK, AND
35:50
THAT BELONGS TO THE
35:50
FATHER, AND HE CREATED
35:52
TIME, AND HE KNOWS WHEN
35:53
THINGS HAPPEN AND THIS IS
35:55
HOW HE HAS DONE IT, AND
35:57
FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE
35:58
END. AND WE SAYS THE END,
36:02
AND HE DOES NOT MEAN THAT
36:02
ANYTHING WOULD BE ENDING,
36:06
BUT THIS WOULD BE THE END
36:06
OF TIME AND SPACE, AND
36:08
THAT WOULD BE NO TIME THAT
36:10
WE WOULD BE BOUND TO, AND
36:12
THERE IS NO TIME, AND IT
36:14
WOULD BE NO TIME AT ALL,
36:17
AND WE COULD BE IN MORE
36:17
THAN ONE PLACE, AND THAT
36:19
WOULD BE NO LIMIT, AND
36:25
THINGS ARE LAYERED IN THE
36:25
SPIRIT REALM AND IT IS
36:26
MIND-BOGGLING TO
36:26
UNDERSTAND THESE THINGS
36:26
ABOUT HEAVEN. AND I AM
36:29
NOT A PHYSICIST OR
36:31
SOMETHING AND I'VE GOT A
36:31
12 YEAR EDUCATION AND I'VE
36:33
HAD SOME COLLEGE BUT THE
36:37
BIBLE SAYS HE IS DELIGHTED
36:37
WHEN HE CREATES, AND HE
36:40
WANTS TO SHOW US HIS
36:41
MYSTERIES. AND WHEN I SEE
36:43
THESE THINGS, BUT ON THE
36:46
TIMELINE, RIGHT NOW, IT IS
36:49
NOT THE LAST DAY, AND IT
36:51
WOULD NOT BE TIME FORTUNE
36:52
RELATION, AND IT IS NOT
36:54
PERILOUS, AND I KNOW
36:57
PEOPLE, AND WITH THEIR
37:01
UNDERSTANDING AND THEY
37:01
MIGHT SAY SO MUCH IS GOING
37:02
ON WITH ALL OF THE WARS,
37:04
BUT YOU REMEMBER THE BOOK
37:04
OF MARK AND WHEN THE LORD
37:07
SAYS, YOU WILL KNOW WHEN
37:08
SOMETHING IS CLOSE AND
37:09
WILL COME TO THE END, AND
37:12
WHEN YOU SEE THESE THINGS
37:13
HAPPENING BUT THE END IS
37:13
NOT YET, AND WILL BE WARS
37:18
AND RUMORS OF WARS AND
37:19
NATIONS WILL RISE AGAINST
37:19
NATION BUT THE END IS NOT
37:21
YET AND WE ARE STILL
37:22
AWAITING, AND THERE ARE
37:24
TOO MANY THINGS WE HAVE
37:24
NOT DONE, AND WE DON'T
37:28
HAVE JOLT 2 TAKING PL.
37:28
YET, AND I HAVE SEEN THE
37:31
GLIMPSES OF THIS, AND
37:34
THIS WILL SHOCK THE WORLD
37:35
WHEN THIS BEGINS TO
37:35
HAPPEN, AND WHEN THE
37:40
MANIFEST PRESENCE OF GOD
37:40
BEGINS TO TOUCH EVERYBODY.
37:42
I CONCEDE THE PILL
37:43
THINGS, CRYING OUT TO
37:44
KNOW GOD. I CAN SEE, THE
37:48
BELIEVERS CARRYING THE
37:48
GLORY, IT LOOKED LIKE
37:50
LIQUID LIGHT AND THE GLORY
37:53
WOULD GO ALL OVER THEM,
37:57
AND HEALED AND THEY WOULD
37:57
GO AROUND PEOPLE, AND THE
38:00
PEOPLE WOULD COME TO LIFE
38:01
EVEN THE MORTUARIES, AND
38:02
YOU REMEMBER PETER AND HIS
38:04
SHADOW, IT WAS NOT A
38:06
HUMAN SHADOW THAT WAS THE
38:09
GLORY COMING OUT OF HIM
38:12
THAT WOULD TOUCH THE
38:12
PEOPLE TO BE MAGNIFIED.
38:15
AND ALSO AND WE HAVE NOT
38:19
SEEN, AND WE DON'T KNOW
38:19
ABOUT ROMANS 8, FOR THE
38:20
SONS AND THE DAUGHTERS
38:23
STAND UP AND BEGIN TO SHOW
38:23
THE POWER OF GOD AND THE
38:25
EARTH. AND THE EARTH IS
38:26
CRYING OUT AND IT IS IN
38:29
TRAVAIL AND THIS WOULD BE
38:30
IN ROMANS, AND THIS IS
38:32
ACTUALLY WHAT TIME IT
38:33
WOULD BE, WE NEED FOR THE
38:36
SONS AND THE DAUGHTERS AND
38:36
LIKE THE BOOK OF JOEL WE NEED
38:40
JOEL, ALSO ISAIAH CHAPTER 60.
38:46
AND WILL YOU LEAVE THE BIBLE?
38:46
AND GOD IS NOT CHANGING
38:47
HIS MIND. I HAVE BEEN
38:50
SHOWN SOME OF THE TIMES ON
38:50
THE EARTH, AND HE TELLS
38:55
ME AND THIS WOULD BE THE
38:55
MOST EXCITING TIME TO BE
38:56
ALIVE AS A BELIEVER, WE
38:58
WILL STAND UP AND WE WOULD
38:59
PUSH BACK IN THE DARK AND
39:02
THE KNOWLEDGE OF HIS GLORY
39:03
WILL BE SEEN AROUND THE
39:03
WORLD, AND JESUS SPOKE
39:06
ALL OF THE TIME ABOUT THE
39:07
GOSPEL OF THE KINGDOM,
39:11
AND WE ARE BORN AGAIN BUT
39:12
WE HAVE GOT A KINGDOM THAT
39:12
WE WOULD BE A PART OF,
39:14
AND THIS IS A POWERFUL
39:14
WORD. AND WE DON'T RULE
39:16
OVER THE PEOPLE, BUT WE
39:19
WILL HAVE ALL OF THE POWER
39:20
OF THE ENEMY, NO MATTER
39:22
HOW GREAT THE DARKNESS
39:22
WOULD BE, AND WE HAVE THE
39:24
POWER OVER THE ENEMY, AND
39:28
WE CAN STEP ON THE SNAKES
39:28
AND THE SCORPIONS, EVEN
39:30
THOSE THESE ARE DEMONIC
39:30
BEINGS, AND WE HAVE
39:32
RULERSHIP OVER THEM, IF
39:34
WE WILL TAKE IT, AND WE
39:38
CAN USE THE NAME OF CHRIST
39:39
AND WE USE HIS WORD AND
39:39
THE BLOOD, AND THESE
39:42
THINGS ARE POWERFUL AND WE
39:42
HAVE THE WEAPON THAT WE
39:44
HAVE NOT, AND WE HAVE NOT
39:49
AND WE DON'T HAVE A WEAPON
39:49
THAT WERE NOT TALKING
39:50
ABOUT YET, AND THERE IS A
39:51
TIME IN ISAIAH, AND
39:54
ISRAEL WAS IN TROUBLE AND
39:55
THEY WERE PRAYING, AND
39:59
THEY WERE PRAYING AND GOD
39:59
BROUGHT THE ARMIES OF
40:00
HEAVEN TO DEFEND THEM,
40:05
AND IT SAYS, AND THEY HAD
40:05
BEEN SENT FOR US TO GUARD
40:09
US, AND THEY ARE NOT
40:09
GUARDING HEAVEN WHAT ARE
40:10
THE ANGELS DOING, AND
40:11
WHAT ARE THEY DOING? AND
40:15
THEY WANT TO STAND UP AND
40:16
TO TAKE THE POWER OF
40:16
CHRIST, AND WE CAN SEND
40:20
THEM TO PULL DOWN THE
40:23
STRONGHOLDS AND THIS IS
40:24
HAPPENING AND THIS WILL
40:24
CHANGE YOUR LIFE, THIS
40:25
HAS CHANGED MY LIFE.
40:27
>>JANE: NOT GIVE ME AN
40:28
EXAMPLE OF HOW YOU MIGHT
40:29
PRAY, AND HOW WOULD YOU
40:31
SPEAK IT OUT?
40:32
>>GUEST: AND WHENEVER
40:35
THEY MY SHOW ME SOMETHING
40:35
I AM TRAINED. THEY
40:38
DON'T JUST SAY SOMETHING
40:39
BUT THEY WILL TRAIN ME,
40:41
LIGHT THEY DID THE
40:46
DISCIPLES, AND IF WE DO
40:46
NOT KNOW AND WE DON'T
40:47
UNDERSTAND THE TRUTH OF
40:47
THE REVELATION, AND WHEN
40:50
HE SHOWS ME SOMETHING THIS
40:51
WOULD BE FOR EVERYBODY AND
40:51
NOT JUST FOR ME, AND WHEN
40:52
YOU'RE BORN AGAIN, YOU
40:55
MUST HAVE JESUS IN YOUR
40:55
LIFE, AND YOU'LL BE
40:58
FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT AND
40:59
YOU MUST HAVE HIM, AND
41:01
YES, YOU MUST HAVE HIM IN
41:02
YOUR LIFE. AND WHEN YOU
41:05
ENGAGE HEAVEN, YOU MUST
41:06
INVITE HIM IN, AND THIS
41:09
IS NOT LIKE WORSHIPING
41:10
ANGELS, AND WHERE THE
41:12
ANGELS FELL AND THEY
41:13
BECAME LIKE GOD'S. AND
41:15
THEY DID BECOME GOD'S TO
41:18
THE EGYPTIANS, THE
41:20
AZTECS, BUT THIS IS NOT
41:21
THAT EVEN THOUGH I HAVE,
41:22
THE REVELATION OF IT. AND
41:25
THE ANGEL SHOULD BRING
41:27
MESSAGES, AND THEY SHOULD
41:28
BRING HEALING AND SO MANY
41:29
THINGS, AND THEY ARE SENT
41:31
FOR MANY DIFFERENT
41:32
REASONS, AND MICHAEL HE
41:34
HAS HAD AN ENTIRE ARMY
41:36
THAT IS WAITING FOR US TO
41:38
STAND UP, AND WE MUST BE
41:42
RELEASED UPON THE ARMIES
41:42
OF THE DARKNESS.
41:42
>>JANE: IS THAT WHAT YOU
41:44
SAY?
41:44
>>GUEST: AND THIS IS WHAT
41:47
I SAY AND WHEN I MAYBE
41:48
KNOW OF A SITUATION, AND
41:50
MAYBE A NEW GANG HAS COME
41:50
IN, I WILL SAY I DON'T
41:52
TOLERATE IT, AND THE LORD
41:55
TOLD ME NOT TO TOLERATE
41:56
THE DARK AND DON'T
41:59
TOLERATE FEAR AND DO NOT
41:59
TOLERATE LACK, AND WE ARE
42:03
TOLERATING THESE THINGS
42:03
AND WE NEED TO STOP IT.
42:05
WE NEED TO BE FED UP WITH
42:10
IT. AND WE SHOULD TAKE IT
42:10
BY FORCE AND WE SHOULD
42:11
TAKE IT TO THE LORD. AND
42:16
THE BIBLE SAYS THIS WILL
42:16
NOT HARM YOU AND THIS
42:17
WOULD BE THE SCRIPTURES
42:18
AND WE HAVE THE POWER OF
42:18
THE ENEMY, AND WE SAY
42:22
THAT WE CAN TAKE THE POWER
42:23
AND THE AUTHORITY OVER ALL
42:24
OF THE DEMONIC
42:26
CONTROLLING, ALL OF THE
42:29
GANGS, AND GIVING THEM THE
42:31
IDEAS, AND MAKING THEM BE
42:35
BOLD AND FEARLESS AND I
42:36
TAKE AWAY ALL OF THE POWER
42:36
BECAUSE I'VE GOT THE POWER
42:37
OVER ALL OF THE POWER OF
42:39
THE ENEMY. AND WE DON'T
42:41
TOLERATE IT. AND THEN I
42:46
TELL THE ANGELS TO GO PULL
42:46
DOWN THESE THINGS
42:47
OPERATING IN THE GANGS,
42:48
AND IMMEDIATELY, THEY WILL
42:50
GO, AND THEY WILL LOOK
42:52
LIKE TEAMS OF LIGHT, AND
42:55
THEY WILL PULL DOWN THE
42:55
STRONGHOLDS, AND EVEN
42:59
WHERE THE ENEMY HAS BEEN
42:59
DROOLING OVER THE
43:00
REGIONS,, AND YOU HAVE
43:04
THE ABILITY TO PULL DOWN
43:04
THE STRONGHOLD. AND IT IS
43:07
YOUR WEAPONS THAT WOULD
43:07
NOT BE CARNAL. THEY ARE
43:09
SPIRITUAL, AND THEY ARE
43:13
MIGHTY TO THE PULLING DOWN
43:14
OF THE STRONGHOLDS. AND
43:17
SO ONE OF THE WEAPONS
43:18
WOULD BE THE HOST OF
43:18
HEAVEN, AND WE NEED TO
43:20
ACTIVATE IT. AND THESE
43:26
THINGS HEAVEN SITTING
43:27
AROUND FOR A LONG TIME,
43:27
AND I SAW MILLIONS OF THE
43:28
ANGELS RELEASED UPON THE
43:28
EARTH, AND GOD SAYS IT IS
43:30
TIME TO RULE FOR CHRIST,
43:33
AND JESUS SAYS AND
43:33
REMEMBER THE WORD AND HE
43:36
SAID I COULD CALL MILLIONS
43:36
OF ANGELS, AND JESUS WAS
43:42
STANDING AS A MAN AND HE
43:42
SAID THIS, BECAUSE HE WAS
43:45
GIVING THIS AS AN EXAMPLE
43:47
AND THIS WOULD BE ONE OF
43:48
THE WEAPONS AND MIGHT NOW
43:53
AND GREAT DARKNESS WOULD
43:53
BE COMING OVER THE EARTH
43:54
AND WE HAVE THE HOST OF
43:54
HEAVEN WAITING, AND I SEE
43:57
THESE THINGS, AND I HAVE
43:57
THAT GIFT, AND PEOPLE
44:00
CANNOT DO IT ON THEIR OWN,
44:02
AND YOU KNOW AND YOU CAN
44:03
SEE, AND ELIJAH SAW THESE
44:10
THINGS, AND HE WOULD NOT
44:11
OF SAID THESE THINGS, BUT
44:11
I CAN SEE THESE THINGS
44:12
EVERYWHERE UP IN THE SKY,
44:13
AND THEY CAN JUST BE
44:13
WAITING, AND WE DON'T SAY
44:16
ANYTHING AND WE SEE THE
44:17
NEGATIVE, AND WE NEED TO
44:19
GIVE THEM THE WORD, AND
44:22
YOU GIVE THEM THE
44:23
AGREEMENT OF THE WORD AND
44:23
THIS IS WHAT YOU DO. YOU
44:24
GIVE THEM THE WORD. AND
44:29
YOU SAY YOU DECLARE IT AND
44:30
WE HAVE THE WEAPONS THAT
44:30
WOULD PULL DOWN
44:31
STRONGHOLDS. AND WHEN YOU
44:33
SAY THESE THINGS, THE
44:34
ARMIES ARE SO EXCITED AND
44:36
THEY WILL GO AND DESTROY
44:37
THE STRONGHOLDS AND THE
44:40
ENTIRE REGION CAN BE
44:40
RELEASED, AND THE
44:43
ANOINTING WILL BREAK THE
44:43
YOKE, AND YOU HAVE THE
44:46
ANOINTING INSIDE OF YOU,
44:48
AND THAT BREAKS THE YOKE
44:49
OF THE DARKNESS, AND WE
44:50
HAVE THE WEAPONS AND WE
44:54
HAVE THESE THINGS AND THEY
44:54
WOULD BE SO POWERFUL AND
44:56
THEY WOULD BE FOR THIS
44:57
TIME, AND WE CAN BEGIN
44:59
AND I KNOW FOR A FACT AND
45:00
WOULD BE SO MUCH LIGHT
45:03
CREATED BY THE BELIEVERS
45:06
OPERATING IN THE POWER
45:07
THAT JESUS HAS GIVEN
45:08
US THROUGH THE BLOOD AND WE
45:09
HAVE THE GLORY AND CRIME
45:13
IS NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO
45:13
EXIST. AND I CAN SEE THE
45:18
PEOPLE, AND BECAUSE THE
45:19
GLORY WOULD BE SO
45:19
POWERFUL, AND WE CAN RULE
45:21
AND REIGN WITH CHRIST.
45:24
AND THE WORD SAYS WE ARE
45:25
THE KINGS, AND WE ARE THE
45:26
PRIEST UNTO GOD. THESE
45:29
WOULD BE SPIRITUAL LEVELS
45:30
OF AUTHORITY. I HAVE A
45:33
LOT OF REVELATION ABOUT
45:33
THE AUTHORITY OF THE
45:34
BELIEVER. THIS WILL
45:35
CHANGE MANY THINGS OF THIS
45:36
WORLD.
45:36
>>JANE: AND YOU PUT THIS
45:38
IN YOUR BOOK?
45:39
>>GUEST: AND YES I'VE
45:41
ALREADY STARTED THE 3RD
45:41
BOOK. I HAVE, AND I'VE
45:43
GOT A CD AND THIS IS CALLED
45:46
INVITE HEAVENS ARMY , AND
45:49
THIS WOULD BE THE SCROLLS
45:50
OF TIME OPENING, AND THIS
45:52
IS ALL ABOUT RULING AND
45:53
REIGNING WITH CHRIST. AND
45:55
PEOPLE, AND THE PEOPLE,
45:58
AND THIS CAN BE OUT ON
45:58
YOUTUBE, AND PEOPLE HAVE
46:01
THESE THINGS BROKEN OVER
46:02
THEIR HOMES AND THEIR
46:04
LIVES, THEIR ENTIRE
46:07
NEIGHBORHOODS AND
46:07
RESTORATION IS COMING
46:08
QUICKLY TO THEM, AND EVEN
46:10
YOUR FINANCES WILL CHANGE,
46:14
AND I CAN STAND AND SAY I
46:15
TAKE AUTHORITY OVER THE
46:17
POWER OF THE ENEMY, OR
46:19
WHATEVER THAT MIGHT TRY TO
46:21
UNDO ME, AND I DO THIS
46:26
BEFORE I GO NOW I SEND OUT
46:26
THE ARMIES TO PULL DOWN
46:28
THE STRONGHOLDS, AND
46:32
THERE IS NOTHING THAT
46:34
MIGHT BE DONE THE
46:36
MEETINGS, AND THE HOST
46:37
GOES BEFORE ME, AND THIS
46:39
BRINGS ME SAFETY AND
46:40
PROTECTION, IT OPENS OF
46:42
THE PORTALS OF HEAVEN,
46:44
AND THE ENEMY HAS BEEN
46:48
REMOVED, AND THIS IS HOW
46:48
WE SHOULD LIVE AND WE
46:48
SHOULD NOT LIVE IN FEAR.
46:51
AND WE DON'T HAVE THAT
46:51
SPIRIT OF FEAR, BUT WE
46:52
HAVE POWER, AND THAT
46:56
WOULD BE THE POWER, THE
46:56
LOVE AND THE SOUND MIND.
46:57
>>JANE: AND WE CAN TAKE A
47:00
BREAK, AND SHE CAN HAVE
47:04
SOME MORE TIME AND WE WANT
47:05

AND WE APPRECIATE THAT
52:27
GOOD MUSIC. AND WE
52:30
APPRECIATE OUR SPECIAL
52:32
GUEST, AND SHE IS HERE
52:32
WITH US TODAY. AND WE ARE
52:35
SO GLAD THAT SHE IS HERE.
52:37
AND SHE IS WITH US
52:41
TODAY. AND SHE IS GOING TO
52:41
BE REVEALING TO YOU, SOME
52:44
OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE
52:45
BEEN REVEALED UNTO HER,
52:47
RIGHT NOW SO, AND GET
52:50
READY AND FASTEN YOUR
52:50
SEATBELT, AND HERE SHE
52:52
COMES.
52:52
>>GUEST: AND VIOLENCE,
52:55
AND VIOLENCE? AND THE
52:57
SPIRITS OF VIOLENCE AND I
53:01
HAD A AMAZING REVELATION
53:05
GIVEN TO ME, BY THE FATHER
53:08
RECENTLY AND I KNEW
53:09
SOMEONE THAT A BEEN SICK
53:09
FOR A LONG TIME, AND THEY
53:13
WERE TRYING SO MANY THINGS
53:13
AND THEY BEEN PRAYED OVER
53:14
MANY TIMES, AND THE
53:15
PEOPLE WERE FASTING AND
53:16
PRAYING, AND THEN I WENT
53:18
TO VISIT THEM IN THE
53:19
HOSPITAL, AND WHEN I WENT
53:24
IN, THEY SAID, THAT WOULD
53:24
BE SPIRITS OF VIOLENCE IN
53:25
THE ROOM, AND HE SAID,
53:27
AND THESE THINGS NEED TO
53:28
BE REMOVED, AND BEFORE
53:31
THE HEALING COULD COME TO
53:32
THE PERSON. AND WHEN YOU
53:34
SPEAK ABOUT VIOLENCE, OR
53:37
YOU WATCH THESE VIOLENT
53:37
THINGS, HE SAYS, AND
53:40
THESE WOULD BE SPIRITS OF
53:41
DEATH. AND I WAS SHARING,
53:45
AND THEY WERE SEEING
53:46
SOMETHING ON THE IPAD, IT
53:47
WAS DESTRUCTIVE, AND THEY
53:50
WERE WATCHING, AND THIS
53:52
PERSON WAS TERMINAL, AND
53:56
YET THEY WERE WATCHING
53:56
SOMETHING VIOLENT ON THE
53:57
IPAD. AND THEN I SAID, I
54:00
SAID, PLEASE STOP WATCHING
54:01
THAT. AND WE BEGIN TO
54:05
RELEASE THE LIFE OF GOD
54:06
AND FOR THEIR LIFE, AND
54:08
THE FATHER COULD SAY THEY
54:11
WOULD RUN AND NOT WALK OR
54:12
CRAWL, AND WHEN THIS
54:17
HAPPENED, AND THEY WERE
54:17
LIFTED UP OFF OF THE
54:18
HOSPITAL BED, AND THE
54:18
FATHER SAID, AND WE HAVE
54:23
GOT TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU
54:23
CANNOT BE CONNECTED TO
54:24
THESE THINGS, AND ONE OF
54:25
THE THINGS ABOUT LUCIFER,
54:28
HE WAS FILLED WITH
54:28
VIOLENCE. IT IS
54:31
DESTRUCTIVE, AND YOU DO
54:34
NOT WANT TO BE VIOLENT,
54:40
BUT YOU COULD BE VIOLENT
54:41
AGAINST THE DARKNESS AND
54:41
YOU CAN TAKE IT AWAY FROM
54:42
THE AND BE BY FORCE, AND
54:42
THAT WOULD BE OKAY. BUT
54:46
IF YOU WATCH A LOT OF
54:46
VIOLENCE IN YOUR HOME ALL
54:47
OF THE TIME, AND THIS IS
54:49
THE REASON YOU MIGHT BE
54:49
SICK, AND WHY THE
54:51
INFIRMITY HANGS AROUND
54:52
YOU, YOU NEED TO GET IT
54:56
OUT OF YOUR HOME AND OUT
54:56
OF YOUR LIFE, AND DON'T
55:01
SPEAK NEGATIVELY ABOUT
55:01
YOURSELF AND DON'T TELL
55:02
EVERYBODY WHAT IS WRONG,
55:04
YOU ARE JUST CONFIRMING
55:04
WHAT THE ENEMY WANTS TO
55:06
DO, AND WE SHOULD SPEAK
55:07
LIFE. AND CHANGE WHAT YOU
55:09
SAY, AND WATCH WHAT YOU
55:13
WATCH ON THE TV AND WHAT
55:13
PEOPLE SEE IN YOUR HOME,
55:15
AND MAYBE YOU WANT A
55:19
HEALING. AND I THANK YOU
55:19
THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO
55:20
SEE WHAT THEY WILL SAY,
55:22
AND KNOW THAT THIS GET
55:23
DOWN INTO YOUR SOUL, AND
55:25
DON'T LET THIS HINDER YOU
55:26
AND YOUR HEALING.
55:26
>>BOB: AMEN THAT WOULD BE
55:28
A GOOD WORD.
55:28
>>JANE: IT IS.
55:30
>>BOB: NOW, THERE WOULD
55:32
BE MANY PEOPLE WATCHING
55:33
THIS, AND THEY ARE
55:35
WATCHING THIS ALL OF THE
55:36
WORLD. AND THEY, THEY ARE
55:39
JUST THINKING ABOUT, AND
55:43
THEY ARE THINKING AND WILL
55:43
I GO TO HEAVEN? AND IS
55:45
THIS REALLY REAL? AND WE
55:47
WANT YOU TO LEAD THEM AND
55:51
BRING THEM TO THE SAVING
55:52
KNOWLEDGE OF THE LORD
55:53
JESUS.
55:53
>> I WILL. THIS WOULD BE
55:56
ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS
55:56
TO DO, AND YOU KNOW, AND
56:00
PERSONALLY I HAVE KNOWN
56:01
THE LORD SINCE I WAS 4, I
56:02
AM 63, WE WILL BECOME
56:04
YOUNGER. BUT YOU NEED TO

LAY DOWN MY LIFE AND I
56:37
WILL SURRENDER TO YOU, I

AND I WANT TO RECEIVE YOU
56:45

56:56
BE WRITTEN IN THE LAMB'S

56:57
BE WITH HIM IN ETERNITY.
57:00
AND THAT WOULD BE
57:00
NOTHING THAT WOULD BE
57:00
WORTH MISSING AND
57:01
ETERNITY, AND YOU COULD
57:04
BE WITH HIM AND YOU CAN
57:04
BELIEVE BY FAITH AND
57:05
RECEIVE IT, AND THEN YOU
57:08
CAN BEGIN A RELATIONSHIP
57:09

00:00
forgot that or somewhere in the body
00:02
that was left on a shelf somewhere
00:04
that prayer is powerful and it may be a
00:07
seri
00:10
we are kings and priests and to our god
00:13
we're not just
00:14
normal average people living on this
00:18
earth
00:18
if you're a member of the body of christ
00:21
you are different
00:23
and we have commissions no one else in
00:25
this earth has
00:26
we have rights opportunities promises
00:29
and
00:30
authority that no one else has except
00:32
those who've received jesus christ as
00:34
their savior
00:36
and he gave it to us himself
00:40
no one should be living or expecting
00:44
fear or violence against them not one
00:47
person
00:48
in the body should be expecting or
00:50
planning for
00:51
it in any way whatsoever
00:54
you should be taking authority over it
00:57
crushing the plans of darkness
01:00
pushing them back amen
01:03
we're supposed to be a voice for god
01:06
represent him manifest his absolute
01:09
power
01:09
and presence in this earth to move
01:13
things and no longer be moved by things
01:15
we're supposed to move them
01:17
shake them and shift them for him
01:21
so that's really who you are
01:25
and we all have that same commission to
01:27
do that
01:29
we may have different ways we do that
01:31
and everybody is needed by god
01:33
everybody has a gift or is a gift and he
01:37
needs
01:37
all of us that's why we're a body
01:41
i know some of them want to separate
01:43
their cell from us i don't know what
01:44
they think they're going to do is a
01:45
finger or a
01:46
leg somewhere you know without any part
01:49
of a body to be with
01:54
and i think the thing that would bless
01:56
him the most is to see us coming
01:57
together
02:01
i'm excited about the prayer convocation
02:05
you know if my people
02:07
that is coming up in orlando
02:10
and it will be live streamed everywhere
02:12
you can go to
02:13
um global fire ministries i think
02:17
jeff johnson is involved in that that
02:19
wild man
02:23
i heard he was in charge he's my friend
02:25
and i heard you're in charge
02:27
am i coming
02:28
[Laughter]
02:31
because we really are praying it's about
02:33
praying for the president for the
02:34
elections for god's will
02:36
god's way
02:40
and i know i'm wearing yes i am wearing
02:42
the president right here
02:48
if you don't like him get over it
02:51
he's not going away
02:55
[Applause]
03:01
we actually have some trump flags about
03:03
that size back there on our table
03:08
oh yeah flying as big and high as you
03:10
can because heaven is
03:14
heaven looks at his tweets
03:17
you're like man yes they pray okay but
03:19
still
03:21
god chose him he is he is a wrecking
03:24
ball he's also a bulldozer he's also a
03:27
builder
03:28
he inspires he does empower and no
03:31
matter what anyone ever
03:32
says to you he loves america and he
03:35
loves the people of america
03:39
all of us no matter what color we are
03:43
or where we come from if you're an
03:46
american
03:46
trump loves you and what he does is
03:50
for the people say for the people
03:54
by the people
03:57
that's what he believes that's actually
03:59
what anybody in leadership
04:01
in this country should believe that and
04:03
be living that
04:05
no one is a dictator
04:10
although some would like to believe they
04:12
are and are practicing that right now
04:16
and they'll be sorry they practiced it
04:19
i get a lot of inside information
04:22
some from the trump administration some
04:24
from heaven
04:26
because nothing is hidden right
04:30
i do have a message and it is about
04:31
america it's about god's plans for
04:34
america so you know what the truth is
04:37
because there's so much stuff going on
04:39
and by the way uh the tribulation isn't
04:41
coming yet i'll throw that in
04:42
if i say news bulletin if i whenever i
04:45
say news building from heaven the holy
04:47
spirit just said it to me
04:50
and he's just saying to me it's not the
04:52
tribulation
04:54
it's not the perilous times the four
04:57
hearses of the apocalypse are still in
04:58
the barn
05:00
he likes to say that one
05:04
things are not going to get worse
05:08
except for those who don't want god
05:11
except for those who don't want life
05:13
okay
05:14
it they may have some real real strong
05:17
issues coming up
05:19
especially november the 3rd
05:22
because trump will win
05:24
[Applause]
05:29
and it doesn't matter where i do a
05:31
broadcast where i go and speak the
05:33
father will say
05:34
you better say that and say
05:37
as bold and loud as you can that
05:40
trump will win on november 3rd in 2020
05:48
because god wants us to have a life and
05:51
a future
05:53
not just hope for a future but a future
05:57
greater than ever has been before
06:00
because this all is happening
06:02
in god's shifting time
06:06
when he is going to shift and i know him
06:08
well
06:09
the first thing he does is expose all
06:12
the darkness
06:15
and i hear from people why is all this
06:16
awful stuff going on
06:18
it's been there all along it was just
06:21
hidden
06:24
and i literally just heard from someone
06:26
in the trump administration saying make
06:28
sure you talk about
06:29
how deep the exposure will happen
06:34
[Applause]
06:37
and they know things we don't know right
06:39
now
06:41
i mean from the highest person in the
06:44
land
06:47
and there'll be domino's fall if you've
06:49
ever seen dominoes fall it takes
06:51
everything with it
06:54
that is what will happen in the
06:56
political arena
06:58
in the news arena in the business arena
07:04
in the line cheating stealing arena
07:07
and those who paid and trained
07:11
for the violence
07:15
god god is not going to allow so you
07:18
know what people will know the truth
07:20
no matter what the fake news i don't
07:22
have my button i should have brought my
07:23
fake news button
07:25
i was going to push it right now
07:30
people i said where did you get that is
07:32
really trump saying you're fake news
07:33
you're just fake fake news
07:36
you should see me embarrass your fake
07:37
news
07:40
and i think what these people don't
07:42
understand that god
07:44
chose someone who's not afraid of people
07:47
he's not afraid of the darkness he's not
07:49
afraid of evil
07:51
obviously he's not afraid of being you
07:53
know
07:54
called names or wrongfully accused
07:56
unjustly accused
07:58
that doesn't even touch him so they're
08:00
wasting their time and a lot of their
08:02
money
08:03
trying to make that happen
08:06
and i know he has a plan i'm not telling
08:08
you about that playing around i'm not
08:09
telling you about trump's plan you'll
08:11
find out about that
08:12
but i can tell you that heaven's very
08:14
excited about what's going to be
08:15
happening
08:16
over the next few months and especially
08:20
this next year
08:26
and i know bless her heart some of the
08:28
millennials are thinking this is never
08:30
going to end
08:31
you know is are we ever even going to
08:33
have a life you know we'll be able to
08:35
live somewhere
08:37
will we actually be alive or will we die
08:40
and i go you need to know god because
08:43
god has all those
08:44
he has all those answers right and i'm
08:47
always somewhere near where they're
08:48
talking
08:49
they don't know me but they're having
08:50
discussions about how their life
08:52
they're wondering if they'll be able to
08:54
live you know if they can live through
08:55
the virus plague
08:56
it's not a plague people okay
08:59
it's not a plague people act like it is
09:03
they wanna
09:04
they meant they wanna make you think it
09:06
is and
09:07
heaven is against social distancing
09:11
[Applause]
09:12
and they're even against the masks now
09:14
if you feel like you have to wear one
09:17
if you're going into the hospital if
09:18
you're going to see senior citizens and
09:20
they would rather you wear one
09:22
than do it but trust me it's okay
09:26
and i'm praying that on november 3rd
09:29
trump will say i'm here to say
09:30
go burn your masks
09:37
he absolutely is not happy about these
09:39
different governors and mayors saying
09:41
you can't hold church
09:42
you have to hold it outside you can't
09:45
talk to each other you can't like
09:46
[Laughter]
09:47
they need jesus
09:51
and and trump is not happy about any of
09:54
that part and they're telling me
09:56
he's getting more and more information
09:58
because guess who he finally talked to
10:00
people
10:02
he didn't talk to the professionals who
10:04
weren't giving him the truth
10:06
i happen to know he's doing this he's
10:08
actually talking to people
10:10
people who know the truth about these
10:13
things
10:13
even considering i'm concerning the
10:15
virus okay i've even stopped calling
10:17
that the quarantine because i didn't
10:18
want to call it a virus
10:20
and i'm telling you this is what god has
10:21
always said from the beginning it's
10:22
going to pass
10:24
it'll pass it'll be gone like it was
10:26
never there
10:27
and he said your lives will be so
10:29
powerful
10:30
and he wants us to know each other to
10:33
come together because you know what the
10:34
bible says about that right
10:36
and i'm sure that the other side would
10:38
like to keep us all apart
10:41
because it gets dangerous the more of us
10:43
who want what god wants
10:45
it becomes dangerous for hell when we
10:47
come together
10:50
and so but i do have good news today
10:53
that god is absolutely involved in this
10:56
country
10:57
and four years ago when he made the
11:00
declaration
11:02
that he would be involved for 24 years
11:05
without stopping
11:07
in the white house
11:10
24 years of god in the white house
11:14
he hasn't changed his mind no matter
11:16
what they're showing in the news or what
11:18
they're saying broadcasting forecasting
11:20
or just
11:21
lying about it isn't going to help that
11:23
side you need to really pray for them
11:25
because it was devastating the last time
11:28
that they lost
11:30
and if they would stop feeding their own
11:32
soul
11:33
things that weren't true then they would
11:35
not expect it to happen
11:38
but unfortunately there's people who for
11:40
the last these last four years
11:42
kept feeding on what the fake news was
11:45
saying i don't mind saying any of that
11:46
okay
11:47
i don't have no problem saying it
11:49
anywhere because it's the truth
11:51
they said lies i know people the kindest
11:55
most gentle
11:56
people have become almost vicious
12:00
because it's filled their soul it's
12:02
filled the layers of your soul
12:04
as a man thinketh in his heart which is
12:06
your soul
12:08
that word heart means the core of your
12:09
being that's where your soul is is a man
12:11
thinketh in his soul
12:13
so is he so because their thinking
12:17
has changed over these last years
12:19
because of what they're
12:20
feeding in that's why he says guard
12:23
your soul guard what you let go
12:27
in god what you let go out
12:30
because then you impact people's souls
12:32
when you speak or prophet
12:34
things and i can tell you from the god
12:36
of heaven and earth he
12:37
is fed up with the fake news he's fed up
12:40
with the lying
12:42
liberals that don't want life that want
12:45
to control that want to take your life
12:47
away
12:47
every bit of this is true this is the
12:49
truth okay
12:50
their platform is the worst i've ever
12:52
seen in my life
12:54
you don't want communism or socialism i
12:56
lived
12:57
through these 60s as a teenager i know
13:00
what that stuff was like
13:02
and if you don't understand you should
13:04
go look up some of the countries that
13:06
that live that way and why are there
13:08
people trying to escape
13:12
venezuela is a good example i tell them
13:15
why don't you go live there
13:18
the ones that want it that way go take
13:20
vacation and
13:21
live there for two weeks and when you
13:23
come back you won't want it anymore
13:26
amen there is no life in that it's like
13:30
death and god said this day i offer you
13:33
life or
13:34
death choose what
13:38
so if you if you're agreeing with the
13:39
side that wants death
13:41
and even helps death you're on the wrong
13:43
side
13:46
choose life if you want life you choose
13:50
life
13:51
okay you offer life and what we say from
13:54
here should bring
13:55
life and hope and joy and even
13:58
celebration and even creativity
14:01
if we represent heaven in this earth
14:03
then we should be like them amen
14:06
everyone in heaven is rooting for trump
14:10
there's a lot more for him than her
14:12
against him
14:13
i literally know people in foreign
14:15
countries
14:17
who are praying for him to win
14:21
they don't want the other they don't
14:23
want what's being offered especially if
14:25
they're already living in
14:26
it and these aren't anybody i even know
14:29
and they don't even know me
14:31
they don't know me for catker
14:34
but people want life around this world
14:37
they want hope
14:38
if they have families and they love
14:40
those families
14:42
and god gave us our families to love to
14:44
be a part of
14:46
to share things with and yet there is a
14:49
side
14:49
who is owned by satan
14:52
and you always know what that side is
14:54
because it wants violence it portrays
14:57
violence
14:58
acts of violence and they don't care who
15:00
they're violent against
15:02
satan doesn't care who dies
15:06
and the ones he's been using when they
15:08
die he won't care either
15:11
there is no love in that camp there's no
15:13
love in hell's camp
15:15
just death and destruction and he does
15:18
not and hell is
15:19
terrified right now they're terrified
15:23
that's why they're doing whatever they
15:25
can to show the worst
15:27
saying this is the way it is they they
15:30
want
15:31
people to think all of america is in
15:33
turmoil and
15:34
they want civil war so bad i can't tell
15:37
you how much they want civil war
15:40
they want us to fight each other
15:43
and we're not going to do it say amen
15:47
and the reason why we won't do it is we
15:49
want a life
15:50
we care right god cares about
15:54
every person i had an opportunity to
15:56
minister to people and
15:58
god's going to touch vietnam just let
16:00
you know right now he's going to take
16:01
that and shift that country
16:03
he's shifting that government to shape
16:05
that nation
16:08
and if you weren't a teenager in the 60s
16:10
you don't
16:11
maybe not know what that means or if you
16:13
were never involved in that war that was
16:15
the most senseless war
16:17
in the world practically they were
16:19
trapped in it too
16:21
but there's been amends made between
16:23
some of our older military and
16:25
leaders in vietnam that did have to
16:28
happen
16:29
but god is going to shift that
16:31
government the socialists right now but
16:32
he's going to shift it you watch it
16:35
because he's into shifting governments
16:38
and shaping
16:39
nations that's another thing he's
16:41
actually using
16:42
trump for because god loves business
16:46
if you didn't know jesus is also ceo in
16:49
heaven
16:52
he has a board room he has special
16:55
places for
16:56
a reward for people that poured out
16:58
their stuff for him on earth they get to
17:00
work with him
17:00
in in the head office
17:05
we always say orders from headquarters
17:07
they do have a headquarters and that's
17:08
where jesus
17:09
sits as ceo so they're all about
17:13
business
17:14
why would he send his son as what say a
17:18
carpenter
17:20
is that business yes so he sent him
17:23
even paul was in business he worked in
17:27
fabrics and colors and he made banners
17:30
and apparel and tents i mean
17:33
a lot of the fish the fishermen how
17:34
about that one that was business
17:36
even luke right i mean he used a lot of
17:39
people in business you know why
17:42
they can cross boundaries that people in
17:45
ministry sometimes
17:46
don't have an opportunity to cross so
17:50
jesus being raised as a carpenter
17:52
he sat with sinners because he had
17:54
business deals with them
17:56
people why did he do that he was he had
17:58
carpentry he did carpentry
18:00
a master carpentry he had designs
18:04
in carpentry he didn't just nail wood
18:06
together
18:08
it was his art it was his gift
18:11
he still does that in heaven he doesn't
18:14
ever take your gift away
18:17
so how important is business to god a
18:19
lot
18:21
and and really more and more you will
18:23
see believers become
18:24
entrepreneurs over these next 10 years
18:27
more
18:28
than ever before because god doesn't
18:30
just talk to me about right now
18:32
he usually does it in like a 10 year
18:34
span or a 50 he's even talking to me in
18:36
the 50 year span
18:38
you're not going anywhere for a while
18:40
okay don't plan to
18:42
escape roll up your rapture rock
18:46
stick it in the closet give it away to
18:48
the next couple generations beyond you
18:50
wait about 80 years and then give it to
18:52
them
18:53
might be closer i don't think about the
18:57
rapture it's not my job
18:59
we know there is one and i'm totally
19:02
saying there is one
19:03
but i'm not told them that isn't
19:05
actually not even jesus knows
19:07
so focus on now your race the one you're
19:10
running right now with god
19:13
that will shift and change things create
19:15
new things in the earth
19:16
the technology is going to be crazy
19:20
if you think it's something now i still
19:22
try to use my i got a new cell phone
19:24
that doesn't help me much at all
19:28
some things i like some things i don't i
19:29
go to jen all the time what is this
19:31
doing why do i have to do this where
19:34
did it go
19:37
so my number one thing i say to her is
19:39
where did it go
19:41
because i can't find it
19:46
oh make it go away i either can't make
19:49
it go away or
19:50
when somewhere i don't know where it
19:51
went
19:53
and people saying well take a class
19:54
god's saying you're not taking a class
19:56
you're not taking the class anything
19:58
that has to do with the ears you get
20:00
schooled in heaven okay i get my
20:03
schooling in heaven that leaves my soul
20:05
free
20:06
from anything else like man's head
20:08
knowledge i got people that can do that
20:10
for me
20:10
but he literally won't even let me
20:12
listen to
20:13
bad conversations death dying sickness
20:17
and disease
20:19
you know things i've noticed about
20:21
pastors i know y'all don't do this
20:22
but when i get invited a lot of places
20:24
and we go out to eat you know what they
20:26
talk about the most
20:28
the worst disease catastrophes or
20:31
traumas
20:32
their congregation has ever gone through
20:36
and i'm like that is not conducive to a
20:39
fine dining atmosphere
20:42
can we talk about vacations or
20:46
the different seasons on the earth are
20:49
god's good plans
20:52
and if these people are dead and in
20:53
heaven why are you bringing it up
20:56
because they're not going to come back
21:00
so make sure you check out your
21:02
conversation
21:04
even people you don't know when you meet
21:05
them give them something good
21:07
when you leave them they've got
21:08
something good in their soul
21:10
right i think a lot of people need that
21:13
they need some good news or fun news
21:17
it's okay to have fun
21:21
my hair does that for me right now now i
21:24
know one day it'll be so normal for
21:26
people to go around
21:27
and more and more i see companies
21:29
allowing their their employees to have
21:31
highlights in their hair
21:33
i've even advised them to you've got
21:35
free advertising
21:37
because if they go something they're
21:38
going to go well what are you about what
21:40
do you what do you
21:40
what do you do you know free advertising
21:43
they could talk about where they work
21:45
and the stuff they do
21:46
because i know people want it
21:50
almost 99 of people like my hair except
21:53
some
21:56
ministers and i
21:58
laugh because when they get to heaven
22:01
they'll be visiting the salons herself
22:06
because this is normal this is just
22:09
heaven culture that's what it is
22:12
it's exciting it's fun it's nice looking
22:14
right
22:16
so why not it's like having some really
22:18
nice apparel but you wear it on your
22:20
head
22:23
and i recently got a letter from a child
22:26
i always know it's a child because they
22:28
don't spell the words right
22:30
and they like to print and i know when
22:32
they when they address the envelope they
22:34
tried really hard to write in cursive
22:36
but it was all scribbly
22:38
and they scratched through some of it
22:40
and rewrote and i want this has to be a
22:41
child
22:42
and it was like 10 questions best
22:46
questions ever
22:49
they never they never ask any boring
22:52
anything okay
22:54
it was exciting and i went and he said
22:56
and please
22:57
write back to me and i went well i found
23:01
out that he lives in
23:02
denver colorado and i'll be going there
23:06
in october so i'm gonna get a hold of
23:08
his parents
23:10
and i'm gonna make a visit
23:15
i'm gonna make a surprise visit
23:19
and say hey i have your answers
23:25
and i i love to talk to kids because
23:28
they're never sitting there going well i
23:29
don't believe that well where is that in
23:30
the word oh god wouldn't want to do that
23:32
i'm like
23:34
no they're like i want to hear more
23:37
that's exciting
23:39
wow i always wondered about that you
23:42
know they asked
23:42
wild questions and they
23:46
believe so much that what god says is
23:49
true
23:50
they actually believe what the bible
23:52
says
23:53
they don't try to change it because they
23:55
don't understand that
23:59
and yes i have a king james version if
24:01
you ever wondered i didn't go stick at
24:03
the bottom of my closet because somebody
24:05
came up with something better
24:08
it's one of the few bibles that actually
24:09
says there's unicorns in heaven why
24:11
would i get rid of that
24:14
nine times in the king james bible
24:17
it mentions unicorns
24:21
and so somebody changed it to rhinoceros
24:24
in the new
24:25
translations and i can always remember
24:29
two of the verses i think one is psalms
24:31
29 and one of psalms 92
24:34
there's seven other ones but for me it's
24:35
easier to remember them one
24:37
god talks about the power of the horn of
24:40
his unicorn
24:42
guess what he rise in heaven
24:45
the father has a unicorn that's what he
24:47
rides
24:48
jesus has a horse holy spirit has one
24:50
they love
24:52
horses they're all over heaven it's one
24:55
of the favorite creatures that he ever
24:58
invented
25:00
he loves the power that's in that horse
25:02
the excitement you know when it
25:03
says it runs into the battle it doesn't
25:06
it's not afraid of the sword it's not
25:07
afraid of anything
25:09
and uh i think i could always see into
25:11
the soul when i would look into the eyes
25:13
of
25:14
a horse i thought you know i can see it
25:16
does say the eyes are the windows to the
25:19
soul and uh so in heaven if you have one
25:22
they'll talk to you
25:24
but the father actually has a unicorn
25:26
this amazing unicorn that he rides
25:29
and he talks about in the bible and
25:30
people thought i think these people
25:32
who were trying to interpret i think
25:34
they dismissed that completely because
25:36
i don't think there's unicorns in here
25:37
you tell children that yes
25:40
i know i have one and i'm gonna name it
25:42
right now
25:44
that's why you must be like little to
25:47
enter into the kingdom of
25:50
that's why i like to talk to children
25:53
and people go oh no they'll they
25:55
i i tell them if they're five and up
25:57
five not bring them in
25:58
and some of the four-year-olds okay set
26:00
them on the front rows because they
26:02
already had those robes planned for
26:03
other people
26:03
[Laughter]
26:05
and they went oh they won't listen oh
26:07
yes they will
26:09
and i talked to them for two hours and
26:10
all they do is giggle and
26:12
say yes and they were excited and their
26:14
teachers are like they haven't moved out
26:16
of their chair
26:19
because they found that god is exciting
26:24
and filled with adventure say adventure
26:29
the greatest adventures you will ever
26:30
have aren't
26:32
on this earth
26:35
they're in heaven and then after heaven
26:39
you don't just have one
26:40
world to do things with when he makes
26:43
the new heavens
26:44
and the new earth you visit planets for
26:47
fun
26:51
say amen why not he's god right
26:56
you know right now you live in heaven
26:58
when you pass your body sleeping but
27:00
your spirit and your soul are there in
27:02
heaven
27:03
and you get to see amazing things and
27:06
step through doorways like you're in the
27:08
middle of the cosmos
27:09
uh you just step through this big
27:11
opening it's called the observatory in
27:13
heaven it's got these
27:14
ancient like big stones
27:17
and you step off you don't see it when
27:20
you're standing there but when you step
27:21
off out into nothing you're literally in
27:24
the cosmos looking at it
27:28
so why wouldn't he make fun planets
27:31
for us to enjoy our lives on when all
27:34
this stuff is over and time is no more
27:38
you won't be bound by time right
27:42
or space which means you can have more
27:45
than one thing in the same space
27:48
that might be too much for your mind
27:54
we have the most amazing
27:58
future as believers than
28:02
anyone in this world and when i talk to
28:06
them about jesus
28:07
i talk about that stuff
28:10
not just yes of course i talk about uh
28:13
actually explaining in detail more about
28:15
his crucifixion but he actually died in
28:17
the garden first
28:20
i know they talk a lot about the cross
28:22
they should talk more about the garden
28:24
and when i saw that cup or that bowl
28:26
where is it right here
28:29
it rocked me because that cup he drank
28:32
out of if that had a stemware
28:35
it would look just like that it's
28:38
empty they have it in heaven although
28:43
now i don't know if you know this but
28:44
god hand picked
28:46
the two angels that would bring that cup
28:48
to him in the garden
28:50
that he had to drink there was every
28:52
evil
28:53
wickedness every sin every disease
28:56
every act of violence everything
28:59
that was evil was in that cup
29:04
he died when he drank it because he said
29:07
not my will didn't he say let it pass
29:09
from me
29:10
they need to talk more about that cup so
29:13
he was already dead to himself
29:15
and he had to be dead to himself when he
29:17
went to the cross
29:20
the cross wasn't that hard for him it
29:22
was taking that cup
29:23
and that perfect holy being had to take
29:27
all of it and let me tell you i saw that
29:31
cup and if i was christ
29:32
i probably would have said the same
29:34
thing
29:35
but you know he was alone in the garden
29:37
except when those two angels came
29:40
and one of the movies i'm doing stuff
29:42
for you actually see
29:44
in heaven when the father picks those
29:46
angels
29:47
gives them their assignment and you see
29:49
him making this cup
29:50
and putting all that in it because it's
29:52
a spiritual cup
29:54
and they brought it to him in the garden
29:57
and then when he drank it they comforted
29:59
him
29:59
they were doing it before he had to
30:01
drink it because they were there to
30:02
support him
30:04
knowing what they were bringing you'll
30:06
know what they were thinking all the way
30:08
down to earth with that cup
30:12
it was very significant that's why it's
30:14
significant to die to yourself
30:17
christ did his greatest things
30:21
after he died to himself
30:25
and although i don't die to go to heaven
30:28
i die every day
30:29
so i can reveal it because i can't have
30:32
myself in any of
30:35
i this to die to myself i do all the
30:36
time
30:38
and he takes me all the time and i know
30:41
a lot of stuff that goes on in heaven
30:43
i know a lot about the spirit realm i
30:46
know after over 20 years of going being
30:48
taken there
30:50
and being taken back to the past and
30:51
into the future i do know a lot
30:55
and so i i tweak
30:58
myself i won't allow anything in my soul
31:02
that is against god
31:04
i won't keep one word spoken in my
31:07
presence or one word or one image i saw
31:10
on the tv or anywhere else i get it out
31:12
of my soul i can't have it i'm not going
31:14
to have a mix
31:16
can i want god and only god
31:19
and i want his will his way not mine
31:23
i told people it doesn't hurt when
31:24
people say stuff because i'm not there
31:29
he is and this is his plan
31:33
and he wants us to know him like that
31:36
you have such creativity in you beyond
31:39
what you could imagine or anyone on this
31:41
earth could think or imagine
31:43
we were meant to be creators say creator
31:48
why because he's a creator correct
31:53
and just getting simple revelation on
31:55
some of the scriptures it'll change you
31:57
forever
31:58
to understand that when he
32:02
took moses and hid him in the cleft of
32:04
the rock that was inside himself
32:07
he took moses and put him inside him and
32:10
showed him
32:11
all of time that had passed before that
32:14
moment that he met him
32:16
moses saw him creating the heavens and
32:18
the earth moses saw
32:20
the ice age that happened moses saw
32:23
the earth split in pieces and separate
32:25
so it wasn't just one land mass anymore
32:28
moses saw all of that
32:31
he couldn't share with people
32:34
so that scripture that says he hit him
32:35
in the clefts of the rock and as i pass
32:37
by i will show you my hinder parts
32:40
he wasn't saying i'm going to show you
32:42
my back i will show you all the time
32:44
that is behind
32:46
us what an amazing
32:50
mystery of revelation that god would do
32:52
this with a human being
32:55
and even jesus john was so close to him
32:58
it's no wonder he didn't die until he
33:00
decided he wanted to
33:03
he could have been here now
33:06
he was homesick right how many other of
33:10
the disciples knew that his name was the
33:12
word
33:14
how many other disciples knew that he
33:17
was
33:17
with god and was god
33:21
john knew because of his relationship
33:24
how much he loved him how much he was
33:27
with him and he began to desire him more
33:29
than anything
33:31
that's when god shows you mysteries
33:34
and john saw mysteries no wonder
33:38
he showed him some of the end times in
33:40
the future
33:42
he took him to heaven and showed him
33:43
great details in heaven
33:45
and even in time the other people
33:48
couldn't even think they didn't want to
33:50
read revelation because they don't
33:51
understand it
33:52
if you get revelation a lot you can
33:53
understand everything that was said in
33:55
that book
34:00
but god wants us to search things out
34:02
but the way you get them is by searching
34:05
him out him first
34:09
you can run after everything you want to
34:11
but you better be running after him
34:12
first
34:15
because john was a different person john
34:18
used to fight with his brother in the
34:19
streets of
34:20
girls the sons of thunder
34:23
that wasn't their anointing
34:26
that was how they acted and their mama
34:30
of course who was their manager
34:36
and how much he changed him so much so
34:39
that he entrusted his mother to him
34:42
and he was saying to his mother i'm no
34:44
longer your son
34:46
i am your savior
34:50
so many things had to happen in order
34:52
for christ to be
34:54
that person for everybody you know
34:58
and you will so enjoy being with him in
35:00
heaven
35:01
but i think because of the time that
35:03
we're in and especially your
35:05
children and your grandchildren will
35:07
have such powerful relationships
35:09
it would be nothing for them to step
35:11
through a portal and go somewhere in the
35:12
spirit realm and come back
35:15
they'll be shaking things they're the
35:17
ones who will speak to the mountain and
35:18
make it jump into the sea and they go oh
35:20
i changed my mind i'll put it back
35:23
and it will be like breathing because
35:26
sharing revelation is like
35:27
breathing to me i don't have to have
35:31
notes you never forget those things that
35:35
you have
35:36
with him or do with him that he shows
35:39
you or takes you to places
35:41
and yet people are so closed in a box
35:44
no god can't do that with anybody you
35:46
know he's too important and
35:48
we're too lowly and i want you don't
35:51
even know who you are
35:54
we can't manifest his power if we don't
35:57
actually believe he wants us to
36:00
and then they don't want to talk about
36:01
scriptures like god said command ye me
36:04
and it freaks them out someone's going
36:05
to probably change that eventually in
36:07
the bible
36:09
i don't like it we shouldn't say that
36:10
well god said he was saying
36:13
command he actually
36:18
if you learn in some of the scriptures
36:19
like he said if you flip it that's what
36:21
i'm saying
36:23
like me i say command not
36:26
command you tell me what to do you
36:29
command
36:31
jesus christ was a commander the father
36:34
was a commander holy spirit is a
36:36
commander
36:37
we're made in their image and after the
36:39
way they operate
36:40
their likeness is how they operate
36:44
they're not talking about what they look
36:45
like twice
36:47
let us make man in our image what they
36:49
look like
36:50
and after our likeness is how they
36:53
operate
36:54
well how do they operate
36:58
say without measure
37:02
say without measure
37:08
in the time in the bible measures were
37:10
given for certain things
37:12
but the closer we get to operating and
37:15
ruling and reigning with christ
37:17
some people will do things without
37:20
measure
37:23
why would he say we were kings
37:26
those are spiritual kings male or female
37:30
kings in the spirit there is no male nor
37:34
female people think
37:36
you don't look like that you don't look
37:37
like a male or female in heaven
37:39
it's not talking about heaven
37:43
that means in the spirit where our
37:46
authority and dominion
37:47
is there is no difference in authority
37:49
for a male or a female that's what that
37:51
means
37:53
he doesn't say only the men are kings
37:55
and priests into their god
37:58
we are kings and priests unto our god
38:01
those are levels of authority and
38:03
dominion
38:06
occupied shall i come meant you take
38:09
dominion until i come
38:12
not sit on your rapture rug he never
38:15
says
38:16
go hide somewhere and wait till i come
38:18
back
38:20
we're supposed to be actively taking
38:23
dominion
38:26
and you have absolute right to do that
38:29
as a believer
38:30
don't wait for satan to come and bash
38:33
you
38:34
bash him
38:38
jesus was never kind to any demons
38:44
he never put up with them it hurt
38:47
them to be near him we
38:50
should live in this earth to a point
38:53
where demons
38:54
are terrified and they all run because
38:57
they
38:57
actually hurt it hurts them and pierces
39:01
them to be around us
39:04
because of the light and the glory of
39:06
god coming from us
39:10
that's how we're supposed to live
39:14
and i've heard people give all different
39:16
versions of that like
39:17
we're so far above everybody we should
39:19
just ignore the devil completely
39:21
it doesn't say to do that either
39:28
jesus didn't ignore him he said what he
39:30
wanted to do
39:32
then he went and tore him up in hell
39:37
god doesn't uh tolerate
39:42
their government heaven does not
39:43
tolerate
39:45
evil comes kick them out unseat them
39:49
strip away their power
39:51
and they're out
39:54
amen we should be running our country
39:56
like that
39:58
if you want to help bring hope a people
40:01
for
40:02
everybody no matter who they are
40:06
because god loves us all god can't abide
40:09
evil but if he didn't love us he would
40:12
have never sent his son
40:15
he has hope for everybody i will not
40:17
everybody's going to go to heaven but
40:19
there'll be a lot more in heaven than
40:21
you
40:21
think there will be amen
40:26
and children have the most delightful
40:28
time
40:30
but i'm happy about children on the
40:32
earth
40:34
they will see and experience things we
40:36
never have
40:38
even the way they live and how fun
40:41
becomes a necessity
40:43
to plan for we plan our business week
40:48
we plan a a vacation maybe once
40:52
maybe twice a year right we we have
40:54
wedding plans
40:56
you make funeral plans you make all
40:59
kinds of plans
41:00
estate planning planning planning how
41:02
about fun planning
41:06
because a happy person makes you a
41:10
happy witness
41:13
don't be so serious about things that
41:15
you can't laugh
41:19
because for years and i lived in those
41:21
years where you weren't even allowed to
41:23
make things look like they were funny
41:25
especially in the church and then the
41:29
laughter hit wasn't that funny
41:30
[Laughter]
41:33
rodney howard brown bushwhacked
41:36
everybody
41:38
god used him i was there when they came
41:40
in they get stuck to the wall
41:42
and couldn't stop laughing okay climbing
41:45
under the chairs
41:47
not being you know proper
41:52
that was god's order happy disorder
41:59
so i know things are going on i don't
42:01
ignore what's going on i just say things
42:04
to make it change
42:06
you know i take authority over darkness
42:08
anywhere i don't have to be by the
42:10
darkness
42:11
i'm not tolerating i am not tolerating
42:13
it
42:15
not in my body not in my home
42:18
not in my city
42:23
i intend to make florida a region of
42:25
light
42:28
i live here i'm not tolerating evil here
42:33
no i bash the witches all i can
42:36
because there's a lot here if you didn't
42:38
know that we're right near some right
42:40
now they're probably screaming
42:45
there are people who need to be free i'm
42:47
talking about
42:48
not the people who practice it i'm
42:51
talking about these spirits who
42:53
deceive them and trap them into that
42:56
lifestyle and sometimes it's
42:57
generational
42:59
they need to be free
43:04
but wherever satan controls what do we
43:07
do no you shouldn't be bored at all in
43:09
your life
43:09
if you ever watch the news you got a
43:11
ministry right there
43:12
[Music]
43:15
you make assignments for the for the
43:17
army send them everywhere you see
43:19
stuff's going on
43:21
if i hear about it they're gone
43:24
i'm up all night long up at 20 hours
43:26
anyway ask my husband i'm out in the
43:27
middle of the street at 3 a.m with my
43:29
staff
43:31
and i have five different ones and i use
43:32
them for different things get a staff
43:35
where to get one any place that has
43:37
things about hiking
43:39
we'll sell just a simple staff
43:44
god used him in the bible people used
43:46
him in the bible they can carry the
43:48
glory they can carry the fire they can
43:50
carry your anointing that god gave you
43:53
when you hit it it causes like a shock
43:55
wave that comes out of there and goes
43:57
through
43:57
it penetrates everything in your
43:59
neighborhood
44:01
people either move or they like me
44:11
it only begins by becoming a believer
44:17
after that you pursue things
44:21
seek ye first what do you seek what do
44:23
you pursue
44:24
seek ye first the kingdom of god
44:27
and his righteousness sake and all these
44:30
things
44:31
all the things you actually need to live
44:33
will be
44:34
added to you
44:38
if you live that way that's exactly how
44:40
your life will be
44:43
you don't hear me asking people for
44:45
stuff to go do things right
44:48
i just obey him i pursue what he wants
44:51
whatever he whatever he says is priority
44:53
and he'll change something in the middle
44:55
of my day
44:56
jen knows that too my baby sister knows
44:58
that
45:00
he'll change your nice little schedule
45:01
you'll got and you think it's messed up
45:04
it's not it's just been made perfect
45:07
you'd miss divine appointments divine
45:09
encounters
45:11
i mean i i do agree we have to have some
45:13
kind of regulated life
45:17
especially if you're raising a family
45:18
but don't leave the encounters and
45:20
experiences and the joy
45:22
of god out of their lives
45:26
let them look forward to that stuff let
45:28
them expect it
45:29
i was visiting my family in texas and my
45:32
grandson had an encounter with the
45:34
living god in his room
45:36
so everybody else was asleep i guess
45:38
guess who not
45:41
he runs out of his room his eyes are
45:42
this big i heard god speak
45:46
i heard him i heard him he's eight
45:49
he ought he knows everything i do he's
45:51
all excited
45:52
he's been taking trips to heaven since
45:54
he was three so
45:56
it's generational i'm gonna make sure
45:59
that keeps going
46:00
he kind of as i said i heard the voice
46:02
of god i heard him speak i heard him
46:05
i heard him well at his birth he almost
46:07
died
46:08
the devil wanted to take him out because
46:09
he's a prophet and he can see that even
46:12
on children that they
46:14
are so he's strong
46:18
very creative even at three he would say
46:20
things you would be shocked at what he
46:22
would say
46:23
and he was running out and i said i hear
46:24
i heard the voice of god said well what
46:26
did he say he said
46:27
he said to me i saved your life for a
46:31
purpose and now that purpose will be
46:33
fulfilled
46:37
i said that was god he didn't need me to
46:41
tell him that he already knew he was
46:42
just sharing it
46:44
so i wrote it down for him and gave it
46:46
to him so he could share his parents
46:48
were beside himself because
46:49
they feeling full of god jesus holy
46:51
spirit this kid can't ever go to public
46:53
school
46:54
he'd be baptizing people in the water
46:56
fountain or in the bathroom in the sink
46:58
he will pray for any sick person and he
47:01
casts out devils
47:05
i knew they'd never been he'd be in so
47:07
much trouble they'd be calling
47:08
all the time down to the school for
47:10
something
47:11
like but they're all like that he's the
47:15
oldest
47:17
and they all know who god is and they
47:20
experience him
47:23
that's how we're supposed to pass it to
47:25
the next generation
47:26
don't keep it for just you and if they
47:29
aren't willing find the next one down
47:31
the line
47:32
somewhere you know god actually
47:35
picked my sister to be mentored by me
47:37
and she probably thought that was for a
47:39
couple years that was a long time ago
47:42
and she didn't want to at the time he
47:45
says i'm giving her to you for a season
47:47
it's been a long season
47:51
because she's number 15 she's a caboose
47:55
and god wants her to be as filled with
47:57
him as i
47:59
am and then let her discover stuff on
48:02
her own with him
48:03
and she's writing books for the children
48:05
in the world about heaven
48:08
[Applause]
48:09
but what she sees and knows is truth is
48:12
what she will be putting in those books
48:14
but they won't be normal
48:17
if you've ever looked up a children's
48:19
book about dying well it's like a new
48:21
leaf then here's the old one
48:23
and that dead shriveled leaf is supposed
48:25
to be what happens to the person
48:28
that ain't going to happen in these
48:32
books
48:34
we don't hide god
48:38
we wear him we walk with him
48:41
and we speak for him
48:45
and people know they have encountered
48:48
god they've heard things they've never
48:52
heard before
48:54
their mind can't be the same
48:58
because it's in their soul and they
49:00
don't know how to take
49:02
it out now we all know
49:05
here how many people know how to do a
49:06
soul checkup let me see your hands
49:08
we will do them before we leave i do
49:12
them every day
49:14
yeah i've even seen yeah god calls me
49:16
his soul doctor
49:19
and i literally was taken in the future
49:21
and i saw and i was walking down the
49:23
hallways of some churches then into a
49:25
big
49:25
business building and they had a little
49:27
plaque outside that said soul knocked on
49:29
the door
49:31
that means these people will know and
49:33
understand how
49:35
with god you can lose stuff out of
49:37
everyone's soul
49:38
and it will be gone like it was never
49:40
there
49:42
instead of going for six weeks of
49:44
psychiatric treatment
49:47
even if it was a trauma you had 40 years
49:49
ago when you saw something it will be a
49:51
race like it was never there
49:55
because god doesn't have time for us to
49:57
wait six
49:59
weeks six months six years to be whole
50:01
he wants you whole
50:02
and not just whole that's divine health
50:06
say divine health
50:08
is being whole that's not sick and
50:11
healed
50:12
sick and healed sick and healed sick and
50:14
healed sick and healed
50:17
or just live with divine health
50:22
even as your soul prospers you will
50:24
prosper and
50:25
live in health that's where it is in the
50:29
bible
50:31
so revelation one revelation he gave me
50:35
changed
50:36
me forever my family who
50:39
does it forever and there are people who
50:41
out there who do it as a lifestyle
50:44
you don't keep anything in your soul
50:46
that doesn't belong there
50:48
no traumas no anger no offense no
50:51
unforgiveness
50:52
no fear no addictions
50:55
no you don't have to have any of it
50:58
why does he say guard your soul that
51:01
means you're in charge of it
51:03
you decide what you watch what you say
51:06
what you hear it all goes in here
51:09
and it gets stored like in files
51:13
even phone numbers if you can't find it
51:15
say god lose it from my soul
51:17
bring it out i've done it
51:20
i'm not kidding i could not find this
51:23
little scrap of paper
51:24
it was a pastor who had invited me in
51:26
some other state and i couldn't find it
51:28
i looked everywhere everywhere
51:29
everywhere
51:30
and finally i sat at my desk and said i
51:32
need it now
51:34
and i saw coming out of my soul
51:38
this little piece of paper it came out
51:40
and went like this so i could see it
51:42
and holders just spirit said why don't
51:44
you write it down right now
51:47
i got my piece of paper wrote it all
51:49
down and it goes
51:55
those things you're looking for that you
51:58
saw are needed to remember
52:00
ask ask and you shall
52:06
it's not impossible
52:10
so all those things that you saw or
52:12
heard things that you need to remember
52:15
don't lose that from your soul
52:19
but but being so free you walk free
52:22
[Music]
52:23
every day all the time of
52:26
anything of the enemy even if you live
52:29
in the hardest place you've ever lived
52:31
in your life
52:32
you can be happy
52:35
and you can be powerful
52:39
the more you dwell and think and
52:41
meditate on stuff
52:42
it grows in layers in your soul
52:46
you don't want to do that if it's not
52:48
something good
52:49
if you're going through a trauma maybe
52:51
you got hurt
52:52
or wounded or somebody died and you're
52:55
grieving so bad you can't get rid of it
52:56
loose the grief from your soul
52:59
it will go and it will be like it wasn't
53:01
there you'll still miss the person
53:03
you'll remember them
53:04
but that grief that pierces you don't
53:07
want a spirit of grief to attach itself
53:11
and the devil will just beat you up with
53:12
that
53:14
if your kids get bullied at school don't
53:17
let them just try to continue in their
53:18
life because guess what they're going to
53:19
remember it all the time
53:21
because it was in their soul it happened
53:22
to them lay your hand
53:24
on their head as the watcher of my
53:26
child's soul
53:28
i command and i choose to lose from
53:31
their soul
53:31
that whole event that happened when they
53:34
were bullied
53:35
the words the actions the accusations
53:38
i lose it right now in jesus name and
53:41
heaven will come down and pull it out of
53:43
them
53:44
and it'll be like it never happened i
53:46
have testimonies
53:48
of mothers and fathers who have done
53:50
that
53:51
and their child goes along happy like it
53:53
never happened to them
53:55
instead of messing them up for 20 years
53:59
and that thing is still in them don't
54:02
let it stay there
54:04
and then after you bind and i choose as
54:07
a watch over this to bind the love of
54:08
god the life of god
54:10
the presence of god the joy of the lord
54:13
i bind that to their soul in jesus name
54:16
then they've had some of god and no one
54:20
can take it out of them
54:22
then they're really happy they're really
54:25
excited they can be
54:26
creative it is it is an awesome
54:30
thing to stand before god
54:33
and he will say to you what did you do
54:35
with your family
54:38
and this time we don't have any excuse
54:42
for letting things continue in their
54:43
lives and aren't good or that happen to
54:45
them
54:47
get rid of it amen
54:50
it's called a soul checkup it is the
54:52
keys to the kingdom
54:55
and the father visited me one time for
54:57
four hours earth time and taught me
55:00
in great detail how to have people lose
55:03
stuff from their soul
55:05
and then to bind god to it and when i
55:07
grew up it was always
55:08
binding the devil if you want to keep
55:10
mine and find him that makes you happy
55:12
behind him
55:15
instead stick the host of heaven on
55:16
crush his plans pull down the
55:18
strongholds and kick them out
55:20
that's more effective we lose the stuff
55:25
that we don't want in there what you
55:27
loose on earth
55:29
by your declarations will be loosed from
55:32
heaven
55:33
which you bind on earth
55:36
the things of god the plans of god his
55:38
will his way
55:40
his promises his
55:43
joy his celebration his expectation
55:47
you bind that and put that in your soul
55:49
that's how you will
55:51
be and then guess what your soul will
55:54
begin to prosper
55:55
and guess what you will begin to prosper
55:59
no matter what situation you're in
56:01
financially emotionally
56:03
physically you change it by using the
56:06
keys to the kingdom
56:08
they were that important
56:12
it has to do with the kingdom it is so
56:15
valuable it's worth everything you have
56:17
to have that
56:18
it might require you to tweak your flesh
56:24
or to change the way you live by what
56:27
you say
56:28
and what you do there's always surrender
56:32
right
56:33
some people tell me you're controlling
56:35
me i'm not telling you to do anything
56:37
i'm sharing what he said
56:39
you know you surrender with the devil
56:42
its control but with god
56:43
is called surrender lay down your life
56:47
and find it in him right take up your
56:50
cross
56:50
daily why to crucify your flesh
56:55
some people don't even want to use the
56:56
symbol of the cross anymore that's oh we
56:58
don't need to be talking about that
57:00
when that happens to be his carpenter's
57:03
mark that he uses in heaven
57:06
don't tell jesus christ you don't want
57:08
to talk about the cross
57:12
you didn't die
57:16
besides to him it wasn't a horrible
57:19
thing
57:20
it was a beautiful thing because look
57:23
what he got for it
57:25
he got us amen
57:30
i think we just need a school of
57:33
revelation
57:35
somewhere i won't be running schools i
57:39
don't
57:40
have time although jeff jensen forgot i
57:43
said that
57:44
and says i'm part of the senior school
57:46
of the prophets and we do have meetings
57:48
sometimes about
57:49
people who are seers or want to
57:51
understand that more
57:53
you're born to be a seer normally you
57:56
have it from the time you're little
57:57
but sometimes god does give you that
58:00
extra gift
58:00
it's a gift but people have it when
58:03
they're born because
58:04
the other side uses it too and there are
58:08
people who do other things
58:10
under satan's power and some don't even
58:13
know that they're doing it under satan's
58:14
power because they know they have these
58:16
gifts but they see the wrong things
58:19
and the guides tell them the wrong
58:22
things that they're seeing
58:24
but but satan can't give a seer gift
58:27
he can use it or abuse it but god does
58:31
give it
58:31
and he's going to give it a lot more in
58:33
this time amen
58:36
but i don't want y'all to leave think i
58:37
don't want you to leave the way you were
58:39
when you came here
58:40
i don't want anyone to leave the same
58:42
okay when you encounter
58:43
heaven it should change you every single
58:46
time
58:47
and yes pursue it pursue
58:51
to see heaven before you die
58:55
and your body sleeps
59:00
i mean 50 years ago if you go and said
59:02
something that let's take around time
59:03
feather or
59:04
go get the tar i'll get the feathers you
59:06
know you can't
59:08
i couldn't have been born 50 years ago
59:10
or 60 or 70.
59:12
i was born 50 years ago i forget how old
59:15
i am
59:17
but you wouldn't be running around in a
59:19
pulpit and saying that
59:22
but now people have gone bizarre on both
59:25
hands
59:26
they've gone extreme in the god's way
59:28
and extreme in the weird flesh way
59:32
you need to know the difference but
59:34
children especially
59:36
should be so acquainted with the
59:39
presence of god
59:40
and who they are in him and the
59:43
expectancy has for them as they grow
59:47
they already have greatness in them he's
59:49
just going to bring it out
59:51
most children born now are to be great
59:54
for god
59:56
even if you don't know their gift which
59:58
should be pretty apparent
60:00
through a drummer they're drumming on
60:02
everything they're a drummer
60:04
if they never stop till it irritates you
60:06
they do it in public when you don't want
60:08
them to
60:09
but they have such passion they're a
60:12
drummer
60:14
get them some drums
60:19
it's not that hard to identify but it's
60:21
something that's
60:22
very important raise up a child
60:26
and the way i made them to be in the
60:28
bent which means
60:29
their gift raise them up in the gift i
60:32
made them to be and they will never
60:34
depart from it
60:35
and people say that differently now
60:38
raise up your child in the admonition of
60:40
the lord is to know the lord to follow
60:42
his ways and to know him
60:44
but raise up a child in the way i made
60:46
them to be is it talking about the gift
60:49
the natural gift he gave them identify
60:53
it make sure they get to use it
60:56
and they will never want to be somebody
60:58
else
60:59
does that make sense to you
61:02
and god said people sit on the pew every
61:04
sunday trying to figure out what their
61:06
child's spiritual gift is
61:08
but they ignore the physical gift they
61:10
ignore the natural gift
61:13
and yet that's who he sent them as that
61:16
like his son was sent to be a carpenter
61:18
from the time he sent
61:19
him he was a carpenter he just
61:22
not happened to put him with joseph he
61:24
on purpose
61:26
put him to be with a master carpenter
61:29
because of the gift he put in his son
61:34
so make sure you're identifying even if
61:36
it's
61:37
years later you should have already
61:39
understood
61:40
why do they like this why do they want
61:42
to do that why do they want to go there
61:44
all the time
61:44
and if they connect with and understand
61:47
to encourage them
61:49
some may be doing something it's their
61:51
gift it's not with god
61:53
pray that god gets them turns them onto
61:56
his path
61:57
that's hot that's cold hot cold i rather
62:01
you hot or cold and not lukewarm you
62:03
know what that is
62:04
rather than be hot that means you know
62:07
your gift
62:08
you're using it for him you're hot
62:11
over here as you know your gift you're
62:13
using it but don't know him that's cold
62:17
all he has to do is turn them and
62:19
they're hot
62:21
lukewarm i don't care what it is i have
62:23
no desire to use it i'm just
62:26
over it you know why he says that
62:28
because he can't use you in his plans
62:30
the plans he has
62:31
you i'll spew out of my mouth doesn't
62:33
mean you're going to go to hell
62:34
it means he can't use you in the way he
62:36
wants to
62:38
so hot or cold if your kid is using
62:40
their gift you need to celebrate
62:42
right and just pray holy ghost go
62:45
get them turn them put people across
62:47
their path
62:48
that their eyes be open that they
62:50
understand yes that's who god made you
62:52
but you need to do it for him
62:57
so we we we come sometimes wanting you
63:01
know of course i'm waiting for the day
63:03
when
63:03
you step in and the fire sweeps over
63:05
everybody
63:05
[Laughter]
63:07
and you walk around and you look like
63:08
burning infernos okay
63:10
that's gonna happen anyway
63:14
it's a time thing it is a time thing
63:17
it's on his timeline it's on his
63:20
timeline or i wouldn't be talking about
63:22
it's on his timeline
63:24
baptism and fire is already been
63:27
sent it's waiting for the day
63:31
it shows up in the phoneless hope
63:34
buildings will be consumed with the fire
63:36
i saw them spiritual fire
63:38
but even will be open to the natural eye
63:42
and that has happened a few times in the
63:44
past where people called the fire
63:46
department
63:48
because the building was on fire because
63:50
people were in there experiencing it
63:52
and they called the fire department they
63:54
couldn't find out what was burning
63:56
they saw nothing burnt but the fire was
64:00
there
64:02
so you one day will walk around with the
64:04
fire that's
64:05
in you being seen on you
64:10
that's we're working on our 2021
64:13
calendar it's called the fire in the
64:15
glory
64:17
and you will get absolute detailed
64:19
revelation on
64:20
each one where it is see an image of it
64:25
you will actually know what it looks
64:26
like so
64:28
that's what we're working it's all by
64:30
revelation and it will
64:32
shift people so quickly when they look
64:35
at that and realize
64:36
this is for us i'm alive i'm breathing
64:38
now
64:39
it is for us amen
64:42
the knowledge of the glory you know thus
64:45
the knowing and understanding of the
64:47
glory of god
64:48
covering the earth it's you taking it
64:52
that's not the glory just being dropped
64:54
on everybody it's you
64:56
carrying it you taking the glory that
64:58
comes out in
64:59
shock waves and you can hear it
65:03
and people get consumed and they're gone
65:08
just they're either taken into the
65:09
spirit realm literally i'm not kidding
65:12
they may be gone and disappear for a
65:14
while and come back
65:16
they may be knocked out and not be there
65:18
but taken somewhere in their spirit
65:21
when the glory begins to come from you
65:22
it will be so devastating to the enemy
65:26
and if you go into walmart and do it all
65:29
the people in walmart will be hit with
65:31
it
65:33
you can't you can't hide people can't
65:36
hide or try to escape from some of these
65:37
things that god is going to do
65:39
and that calendar will talk about all of
65:42
it
65:43
and that's god's best way for me that he
65:46
uses me
65:47
is to take a calendar and either release
65:50
something
65:52
make you aware of it show you exactly
65:54
what it looks like
65:55
because an image is worth a thousand
65:58
words
66:00
and he works with me with images all the
66:02
time so the first one on the host of
66:05
heaven the army of heaven that was our
66:06
first calendar the second one was all
66:08
about heaven
66:09
we have a few out there on that table
66:12
and you see places in heaven that
66:14
literally exist
66:15
exactly how it looks what happens there
66:18
it gives you a greater understanding and
66:19
revelation on heaven but the wonder the
66:21
fire and glory is going to be very
66:23
powerful because these are things that
66:25
we
66:25
will all experience and
66:29
do is things you will do you'll even
66:32
know what to do with
66:33
it so this is how god that's why he gave
66:37
his word he put it in
66:38
writing in his word in writing so you
66:41
would have great understanding of him
66:43
and the things that have happened the
66:45
things that are coming but when you add
66:47
an
66:48
image it changes everything
66:52
then you know this is supposed to happen
66:55
this is what i need to run after
66:58
my friend got baptized in fire and i
67:01
wanted it
67:02
and i was already pursuing jesus but i
67:05
kept
67:05
asking i want that fire i see that fire
67:09
their change is so bold i want it i want
67:12
it
67:12
and i finally got a measure
67:16
knocked me slap out into the
67:17
congregation three or four rows back
67:21
my body vibrated for eight hours they
67:23
locked me in the church i wasn't in my
67:24
body
67:27
two angels came and carried me back in
67:28
time and set me on the ground outside
67:31
the tomb of christ
67:32
literally in that time wasn't a vision i
67:35
was
67:36
in that time when the stone had been
67:38
rolled away
67:42
so you can expect when these things
67:45
you've been waiting so long for
67:46
it will be worth it
67:50
some things we can get measures of but
67:52
what he's talking about
67:54
is an encounter you will never forget
67:58
and people won't have to ask you have
67:59
you received baptism and fire
68:02
because you won't be the same
68:05
you will become bold the fire
68:09
makes you bold like in the book of acts
68:13
when the people in the upper room they
68:14
got a measure
68:17
so that it was on top of them okay
68:20
they were hiding right say they were
68:23
hiding
68:25
they didn't hide no more after that they
68:28
went out in the streets won
68:29
three thousand people in that day
68:32
they boldly proclaimed it takes all of
68:35
fear fear can't even come back in you
68:39
it burns things off the wall of your
68:41
heart like they were never
68:43
there and instead god writes
68:47
on the wall of your heart that's what
68:50
baptism in fire is
68:52
and you'll feel the heat like you never
68:54
thought before
68:57
it is we're in his time
69:02
it's not for 20 years down the road
69:07
so why should we be filled with fear we
69:10
look around and see what
69:11
man is doing or what man is saying
69:15
or christians who don't have a clue
69:20
so what happens is when they don't
69:22
understand his time to go to the end of
69:23
the bible
69:25
and that's actually what's happening
69:27
even with pastors well i don't know what
69:29
any of this means so it looks like it's
69:30
wrapping up now the antichrist must be
69:32
around the corner so
69:34
get ready to get taken out of here and
69:37
i'm like that is not what's happening
69:41
he's setting up a platform right now
69:44
for us to demonstrate his power the
69:47
manifested sons and daughters
69:49
[Applause]
69:55
and he has to have a place
69:59
our country what we have total freedom
70:02
to operate
70:03
amen and that's why he says 24 years in
70:06
the white house
70:07
that doesn't mean he won't still be in
70:09
the white house that means it will be
70:11
so changed by the end of that 24 years
70:15
it won't look or sound like the same
70:17
country
70:20
people will want to have friends
70:24
they will want to have christians as
70:25
their friends they will seek
70:27
out christians on purpose to know as
70:30
friends
70:34
they'll want to know why are your
70:36
children excelling above
70:38
all the rest of the school
70:41
and it will be jesus christ
70:46
so god has to have this time why would
70:48
he take away some of the best times on
70:50
the earth
70:52
if he said we would do those things why
70:55
would he sit up there on the throne
70:56
saying oh i'm changing my mind it's just
70:57
getting too tough
71:02
no he knows exactly what he wants amen
71:05
you just have to be born i wouldn't say
71:08
the perfect time i would say you're here
71:10
because of god's time
71:12
he timed your birth on
71:15
the earth you are not a mistake however
71:18
that birth happened
71:20
you came from him your spirit man
71:24
came from him we can't make a spirit
71:29
we can make bodies by the way god
71:32
designed us right
71:33
but you can't make a spirit
71:36
even the word made a body called adam
71:39
was there any life in it no
71:42
remember it says go back and read
71:44
genesis when he made
71:46
adam's body it was there was no life
71:50
no life until the father who carries the
71:54
spirit of life that's your spiritual
71:55
body
71:56
leaned over and breathed into adam's
72:00
nostrils that spirit of life that was
72:02
his spiritual body he breathed into him
72:05
and then he became a living
72:08
soul when does life begin
72:11
at conception down here at conception
72:16
god sends a little spirit of life from
72:17
him by the holy spirit
72:19
he goes into that little dot of flesh
72:21
and knits and attaches it
72:23
so it doesn't go back to heaven
72:26
and it can't leave he literally knits i
72:30
knit you together in your mother's room
72:31
doesn't mean oh i put your arms and legs
72:33
on
72:33
i knit you that was you that was your
72:35
spiritual being that was you who lived
72:37
in god
72:39
and he sent you to this earth on the
72:40
time he needed you to be here
72:43
your children are very key to be here
72:45
right now
72:47
and he picked you to bring them here
72:52
he needs us to bring them that's why he
72:55
doesn't
72:56
like it when it's stopped
73:01
he doesn't like it because he had plans
73:03
for that child
73:05
amen
73:08
he knows what he's doing isn't it
73:11
amazing he picked you to raise children
73:15
well he trusted my mom by giving her 15
73:17
[Laughter]
73:22
sometimes life isn't easy he doesn't
73:24
promise that it will
73:25
always be easy but he promises
73:29
according to his words we will always
73:32
have authority
73:33
we will always have dominion we will
73:35
always have creativity
73:38
to make food or multiply the food
73:42
to stop the storms if we have to to walk
73:45
on water
73:46
these are his promises even in the days
73:48
we're in he didn't take those promises
73:50
away
73:52
we need to believe them
73:55
you pray you believe he heard you you
73:58
believe that's going to happen
74:01
your faith is what draws that
74:04
he gives it to us but he has to see it
74:06
active in your life
74:08
and this is something he taught me he
74:10
said your
74:11
will that you want something has to like
74:15
your
74:15
actions must line up with what
74:18
your will has asked for
74:22
they have to match when they match
74:25
something is created
74:30
stand up
74:41
even if you've done this before i want
74:43
you to do anyway
74:45
we're going to take about three minutes
74:46
to change our life
74:49
god doesn't take forever
74:53
working with us sometimes may take
74:55
forever
74:56
right because he needs our agreement he
74:59
needs our participation
75:01
not our frustration he needs
75:04
participation not frustration you need
75:06
to remember that okay
75:08
because sometimes what he gets is
75:09
frustration because it's still you know
75:11
we're frustrated
75:12
we're we get so frustrated and
75:14
aggravated we almost forget everything
75:16
he said
75:18
because the enemy's using the
75:19
frustration aggravation right
75:22
to get us away from what his focus is
75:26
or what his purpose is don't let it ever
75:28
happen again
75:30
because you can't create when you're sad
75:33
or mad
75:35
that's why they hide artists they hide
75:38
athletes
75:39
they hire they hire hide uh people who
75:42
have these wonderful gifts they hide
75:44
them until they perform
75:47
because otherwise they don't even
75:49
realize it's their soul
75:51
but they think well their mind can be
75:52
corrupted or it could be crushed
75:54
their emotions could be a mess and then
75:57
they won't be able to do what they were
75:59
being paid to do or they wouldn't do
76:02
so if all of those people knew about
76:06
losing that junk from their soul
76:08
they would be free amen
76:18
so let's look up to heaven
76:21
and say father i am your child
76:25
i have received your son
76:29
that means i can have a soul checkup
76:34
for free
76:37
so i'm going to do that right now
76:40
i choose with my will
76:44
to lose from my soul
76:47
i want you to go like this when we lose
76:49
it all
76:50
aggravation of frustration
76:55
all sadness all
76:58
lack all anger
77:03
all offense all addictions
77:08
all angry words whether i heard them
77:13
or i spoke them i lose any crushing
77:19
any trauma i don't want it
77:23
in my soul i lose
77:26

78:00
pulls stuff out
78:03
the holy spirit loves this now we're
78:05
gonna
78:06

78:09
because if people walk up and they say
78:11

78:15
bad the words don't go away you keep
78:17

78:28

78:31
literally when someone says something to
78:34
me even in front of them sometimes
78:36
they'll go
78:36
excuse me i choose as an act of my will
78:39
to lose all those horrible mean
78:42
hateful words that were just spoken to
78:44
me i'm not keeping them in my soul
78:46
in any way in jesus name
78:49
and they're gone and i don't stop and
78:52
god i choose now to bind to my soul
78:55
your life your words your
78:58

79:01
and i am so happy when i turn back
79:03
around the person's like
79:07

79:09
day going how's your day
79:11

79:13
not the person
79:15
filled with all that junk that they just
79:17
planted in me
79:19
and i make it very obvious i'm not
79:22
taking it anymore
79:25
that's a lifestyle say a lifestyle
79:29
it's not a one-time thing say i breathe
79:32
every day
79:34
i eat every day i sleep every day
79:37
i'm doing a soul checkup every day
79:41
it's called heaven culture
79:45
so are you ready i choose as an
79:48
act of my will to bind to my soul
79:54
these will come in waves the love of god
79:59
the life of god the
80:02
presence of god the plans of god
80:08
his expectation his
80:12
celebration his validation
80:17
those i bind in jesus
80:20
name amen
80:23
[Applause]
80:31
sit down
80:34
now you really are different
80:38
because you let stuff go
80:42
you hear people all the time just let it
80:43
go let it go but they don't know how to
80:45
tell you to do that
80:46
right it'll pass it'll be all right
80:48
eventually you know in a few months you
80:50
might get over it maybe a year
80:52
just let it go but if it's in your soul
80:55
it's in your mind if it's in your soul
80:58
it's in your emotions if it's in your
81:01
soul it's in your will
81:02
and the way god made you is to run after
81:06
his stuff
81:08
and the more you get the more you want
81:10
and if it's in you
81:12
you will pursue it you will choose it
81:14
and
81:15
when you keep choosing it you will
81:16
manifest it
81:18
in your emotions because that's the
81:20
layers of your soul that's you
81:23
that's who you are and people go what
81:26
happened to you
81:26
i just actually started living right
81:28
that's what i did
81:29
i decided to live on earth like they
81:31
live in heaven
81:33
because no one has any issues in their
81:36
salt they still have their soul
81:37
their soul doesn't sleep that makes me
81:39
laugh and they say soul sleep
81:41
you couldn't choose what you're going to
81:42
eat in heaven you couldn't choose where
81:44
you were going to go
81:45
you were going to go visit your soul is
81:47
your mind
81:49
your will what you choose and your
81:51
emotions what you just
81:52
you'd be up there doing nothing so your
81:55
soul doesn't
81:56
sleep the flesh sleeps
81:59
your spirit man your soul's in the very
82:01
core of it
82:02
it goes with you okay it goes with you
82:06
so in heaven they don't have any of that
82:08
stuff going on
82:10
you already you're filled your soul
82:12
still gets filled all the time it learns
82:13
how to create in heaven
82:15
i mean really create not people say
82:17
thank you jesus
82:19
we will never create a race of people
82:21
and have to be god to them say amen
82:25
he already did that we don't have to do
82:26
that but your creativity explodes in
82:29
heaven
82:30
but we're in a long season
82:34
on the earth of creativity
82:37
and if you get ideas make
82:40
sure your soul is
82:44
free of any junk
82:47
because whatever is in you will go into
82:49
that creativity
82:52
and the enemy he knows that
82:55
that's why people with gifts amazing
82:59
gifts
82:59
create darkness they're really good at
83:02
making movies but they're dark because
83:04
guess what their soul is
83:06
and that comes out in the then the movie
83:09
and the creativity
83:11
they create apparel they have a great
83:12
gift for it but the images they put on
83:14
there or the styles i use
83:15
are not very nice because their soul is
83:18
dark
83:20
that's how that's why it's so important
83:22
to understand
83:24
how powerful it is to know what you were
83:26
taught tonight
83:28
if you create whether it's music
83:31
or yummy food i like
83:34
i like to i like um sweets jen knows
83:37
that
83:41
i like movies really good powerful
83:44
decent movies say decent
83:49
heaven has movies they don't need
83:51
ratings
83:54
they they say what the ratings if it's
83:57
ours rotten don't see it
84:00
the first trip to heaven they took me to
84:02
they took me to a movie theater how
84:04
about that
84:05
people always say when did you first go
84:07
on don't ask me that
84:10
if you're already trying to let people
84:11
understand how amazing heaven is
84:13
best shifted or baptist
84:17
you don't want to tell them well they
84:19
took me to the movie theaters and
84:20
writing you off my list
84:23
pink hair was enough now you've gone
84:25
over the edge now
84:29
i wrote a roller coaster ah piper take
84:31
you off the list
84:33
we'll scratch you off right now
84:37
so when they always i said well how
84:39
about if i tell you after i've been
84:40
there a couple times
84:42
how about we do it well for the very
84:44
first time i was
84:45
caught up until the movie theaters in
84:47
heaven which were fantastic they didn't
84:49
they didn't have no ratings they had fun
84:51
adventurous
84:53
intense exciting
84:56
powerful i'm not kidding they were the
85:00
most exciting
85:01
amazing i was actually showing like
85:02
three different movies
85:04
yes you still have popcorn you sit in
85:07
these
85:08
chairs that conform to your body
85:11
there's a waterfall at the end when it
85:13
disappears it's the screen
85:16
the walls are alive so the light will
85:20
be the way it needs to be to see the
85:21
movie but
85:23
you go down the other hallway and go in
85:26
a different door and you're
85:27
in the movie you're one of the people
85:30
starring in the movie so it's a little
85:34
different
85:35
you sit in this chair and it conforms to
85:37
you like i'm gonna see you forever
85:39
comfort i always hear comfort there it
85:41
wraps itself around you could sit on a
85:42
rock and be comfortable
85:44
but you see these amazing amazing seats
85:46
with all the amazing designs right
85:48
everybody's excited because usually
85:50
they've been invited to see their friend
85:52
be in a movie
85:54
you're coming to watch their debut and
85:56
it's captured
85:59
i don't know how to explain to you
86:00
anymore is captured not
86:02
filmed it's captured and sent to that
86:05
screen you're watching
86:07
and so at that moment you're seeing them
86:09
actually do it it's not something that
86:11
was done beforehand
86:13
and they could be in one with john wayne
86:15
yes he still makes movies that was his
86:17
gift okay
86:20
and but you sit there and this clear
86:22
transparent menu appears
86:24
you push what you want and then like
86:25
that it's on a tray in front of you
86:28
popcorn you think they have movies
86:30
without popcorn
86:32
i think the angels like it but anyway
86:36
it's okay to laugh remember
86:40
and then i was taken to the place they
86:43
were capturing the movies
86:45
that was cool how i saw them make
86:49
they kind of whatever the people were
86:51
there doing it
86:52
in the scene it was created
86:56
it wasn't on a backdrop with a green
86:59
screen
87:00
there's no green screens they actually
87:02
do the action themselves
87:04
and it's being created as they're doing
87:06
it with them in it
87:07
taken and transported back on that
87:09
screen so you see your family then you
87:11
all go out and eat afterwards and talk
87:12
about your debut
87:15
god loves he loves the arts
87:19
he loves the arts okay but he wants them
87:22
to be decent
87:24
and god said kept tell me pray for
87:26
hollywood he said they
87:27
what they're putting out is dark because
87:28
their soul is dark and that's how i
87:30
that was before he told me about loosing
87:32
or binding to my soul
87:33
what's in them is what they're putting
87:35
in the movies
87:37
so make sure you know who made that
87:38
movie that you're going to go watch
87:41
and if it's someone who's dividing don't
87:43
watch it because that spirit of them
87:46
that's in them will be in the movie they
87:48
just made
87:49
the more understanding even the world
87:51
will begin to understand about the soul
87:53
and will we still respond i don't know
87:56
about the body of christ
87:57
but they'll even have soul doctors for
87:59
people and guess what even the people in
88:02
the world
88:03
can lose from their soul it's the way he
88:05
made them
88:06
they'll still have to say in jesus name
88:09
because it ain't going to happen
88:11
it's basically this truth because people
88:13
say that can't be true
88:14
well jesus healed people that weren't
88:16
believers
88:19
and they didn't say come here i want to
88:21
be a believer did they
88:23
they reached out to him
88:24
[Music]
88:27
as their healer they had faith
88:30
he could heal they knew that he was he
88:33
would say he was the son of god that he
88:34
was a messiah
88:35
when they went to him and said i i'm i'm
88:37
believing you for healing
88:39
they were reaching out to know him as
88:41
their savior because he would heal them
88:43
and then he would say
88:44
now go and sin no more did he say that
88:49
that's another shock for you isn't it
88:52
so when you reach out there's people who
88:55
get saved
88:56
that you'll never know about until you
88:58
get to heaven because they still
89:00
reached out to jesus christ for who he
89:03
was
89:03
for what they desperately needed in that
89:05
moment they didn't get a piece of him
89:08
they got a hold of him it was their cry
89:11
it was their
89:12
hunger for that and they got both or he
89:15
would not have said that to them
89:16
and your sins are forgiven
89:20
because they acknowledged who was
89:22
believe on the lord jesus
89:24
christ and you shall be
89:29
you're not going to get to heaven
89:30
without him but people who reach out
89:34
for out of desperation for what they
89:36
need are recognizing who he was or he
89:38
would not have said to them
89:40
you are now healed be healed and now
89:42
your sins are forgiven
89:44
but you never saw in the world where
89:45
they wrote down and said forgive me of
89:47
my sins
89:47
it was in that cry and that hunger of
89:50
recognizing
89:52
believe who he is correct
89:56
we we need to understand if they were
89:59
still using faith even when they didn't
90:00
have it they were reaching to him for
90:02
that
90:03
and he said and now your sins are
90:04
forgiven
90:07
isn't that powerful that should give
90:10
everybody hope about your family members
90:14
that's why we as representatives of
90:17
heaven
90:18
the way we live and act will draw people
90:21
to
90:21
that light but we've always been told
90:25
don't show who you are don't let
90:28
yourself be
90:29
seen you know you don't want people to
90:31
be drawn to you
90:32
but if we have christ that's why he's
90:34
drawing you
90:37
we will have many christian
90:40
celebrities in this time
90:44
and they will be called christian
90:46
celebrities
90:47
do you know what the holy spirit told me
90:48
the word celebrity means to celebrate
90:52
it doesn't say worship
90:56
it depends on where people carry that
90:59
but
90:59
in this day we will stand up and stand
91:03
out on purpose because he wants
91:07
us to or they won't know
91:11
who he is it's a new way he's sending us
91:14
really he is sending us for that purpose
91:17
to be and he's told me in person you
91:19
will be a christian celebrity
91:20
you'll get bashed a lot for it but don't
91:22
listen to any of them
91:24
because you will bring many into the
91:26
kingdom because of what you do what i
91:28
have you do
91:29
i'll be totally involved in hollywood
91:31
which god is taking that
91:33
throne away from satan he's taking it
91:36
away
91:37
[Applause]
91:39
the arts belong to god they started
91:42
in heaven and one of the platforms he
91:46
gave me was arts and entertainment
91:48
and entertainment family fun
91:51
entertainment why he wants us to laugh
91:55
and enjoy our life and what a message to
91:58
give in or
91:59
you know right next to orlando right
92:03
a place of supposed to be of course
92:06
harry potter world's coming down
92:07
[Laughter]
92:11
that's an that's a news bulletin from
92:13
heaven
92:15
if you have the books burn them loose it
92:19
from your soul
92:21
it's not a joke news from
92:24
heaven witchcraft is
92:26
not a joke and it is
92:29
not a fantasy
92:34
it's not a fantasy
92:37
and we've been blinded to believe that
92:40
there's
92:40
good witchcraft there are no
92:44
good witches even if they don't know it
92:49
there is no good god speaks against him
92:53
doesn't he
92:54
in the bible another word for witchcraft
92:56
is necromancer
92:58
have nothing how clear can you be have
93:01
nothing to do with the necromancer
93:05
the dark arts the black arts was
93:07
introduced by the angels the
93:09
the watcher angels who fell created
93:11
offspring in the land and then were
93:13
worshiped
93:13
as gods those angels were they
93:16
introduced human sacrifice they
93:18
introduced the black arts
93:19
that's how they got here
93:22
they're bound in chains they're not on
93:24
the earth right now
93:26
i don't think you have a nephilim
93:27
showing up at your back door
93:31
so there's things we have to consider
93:33
and understand
93:34
when we have understanding that keeps us
93:38
safe from the enemy deceiving us
93:41
don't believe a lie because it will
93:43
consume you and you won't know
93:46
you'll be blinded from the fact that you
93:48
were lied to
93:52
deception is something satan likes to
93:53
use because it doesn't cost him much
93:56
he just people walk around don't know
93:58
what's going on what time it is that
93:59
they're looking for answers and people
94:01
who
94:02
look very entertaining or they have
94:04
sounds
94:05
right what they're saying but you don't
94:08
know
94:08
people by their gift
94:13
your gifts are important but you don't
94:14
know them you don't know of them as a
94:16
person
94:16
you will know them by their fruit
94:21
what that means is what are they
94:23
producing
94:24
whether it's in the movies in music
94:28
and entertainment going on those people
94:31
who are making
94:32
that what does their life look like
94:36
are they totally into darkness are they
94:38
against
94:39
life or light if all they want to do is
94:43
deceive
94:44
those people are not people to follow
94:47
or to watch or to have their stuff in
94:50
your home
94:52
okay you want god's stuff things that
94:54
are a lot filled with life
94:56
joy happiness celebration those are okay
94:58
but you can't
94:59
attach something because there is
95:01
something attached
95:04
things can attach to all kinds of stuff
95:05
i'm not putting fear in you i'm just
95:07
letting you understand
95:08
if it looks like smells like reed's lie
95:10
sounds like witchcraft
95:12
don't have anything to do with it
95:14
because it is controlled with the big c
95:19
and we've been duped into thinking it's
95:21
okay because it's fun it's exciting it's
95:23
romantic it don't matter vampires are
95:25
vampires those are real in the spirit
95:27
realm
95:28
don't watch that stuff it represents
95:31
d-e-a-t-h
95:33
i don't care how amazing and beautiful
95:35
it looks it still represents
95:37
death amen
95:42
so i'm well schooled in heaven about all
95:45
of the
95:46
i always knew that stuff was junk
95:47
because my dad told me it was
95:50
he never wanted to celebrate halloween
95:54
one day when we get big enough as one
95:57
quest
95:58
we will have festivals of light on
96:01
october 31st
96:03
everywhere in this country
96:07
and it will have one bit of darkness in
96:10
it
96:11
because that day does not belong to the
96:15
enemy
96:16
every day belongs to us as the body of
96:19
christ
96:20
[Applause]
96:22
amen
96:25
so i have a couple other things i could
96:27
share uh well you've heard the most
96:29
important thing god want me to say is
96:31
trump will win
96:31
make sure you vote for him amen
96:38
he needs our votes but i promise you the
96:40
god of heaven and earth is absolutely
96:42
saying
96:43
i've had people call and say would you
96:44
repeat that uh would you
96:46
repeat that publicly i absolutely will
96:49
repeat it
96:52
i will be making a trip to capitol hill
96:55
probably about a week before the
96:56
elections and i will be standing in
96:58
front of capitol hill being filmed and
97:00
taped for what god has to say about that
97:02
election
97:04
okay
97:06
and i will be talking about also to make
97:09
it worse for some people
97:11
i would definitely talk about the next
97:12
20 years of god in the white house
97:16
[Applause]
97:18
because he's going to do it
97:20
[Applause]
97:22
and even people who didn't want any of
97:24
this will be blessed by it
97:26
because they'll be living with what god
97:28
wants done amen
97:31
he wants america to not be about the the
97:34
american dream
97:36
he wants to be known for the god of
97:38
america
97:39
and that's he wants people to come here
97:41
to find
97:43
him amen
97:46
so you have exciting lives i want to
97:49
take a couple questions does anyone have
97:50
a question
97:52
that's burning in you that i haven't
97:54
answered what is your question
97:58
oh she said what about the economy
98:00
absolutely
98:02
yes the economy will be accelerated
98:06
it actually will have we will have more
98:08
jobs than he had created in his first
98:11
four years
98:13
already because he has had to live
98:17
through this mess too
98:19
and he understands through all this
98:20
thing i've heard there are other things
98:23
i
98:23
have to change i have to change them so
98:26
everybody can benefit
98:28
from you know from what he's the what
98:30
god's shown him to do in this country
98:33
and he has sought out more christians
98:35
more
98:36
prayers uh more ministers
98:39
than any other former president
98:42
and and he continually thanks god
98:46
okay so we cannot escape
98:50
being blessed because the very head
98:53
highest person in our land who wants god
98:57
allows god invites god prays to god
99:02
we remember when it says pray for those
99:05
in authority
99:06
because when god is of god that people
99:08
rejoice
99:10
you will be rejoicing over the economy
99:12
over the education arena over the arts
99:14
and entertainment
99:16
over industry it's not going to stop
99:20
amen and so absolutely
99:24
if people lost jobs what you get will be
99:26
better than what you ever have before
99:29
he may even give you your own business
99:33
because you have seen in this time a lot
99:35
of people god has shown you things that
99:37
are needed that weren't here before
99:39
one of the things i do know that trump
99:41
is going to have in place
99:43
is a way to help people to complete the
99:46
vision they have
99:47
to bring help and hope to america
99:52
amen so
99:55
the one thing that will change is no
99:57
masks
99:58
no no mask
100:04
[Applause]
100:06
amen god doesn't want us to be
100:10
muffled
100:13
what are you going to do well we are
100:15
going to enforce that you just can't do
100:16
that they come and get slain in the
100:18
spirit what are they going to do well
100:19
they are slain in the spirit
100:22
they will get up different
100:26
so you have a question
100:36
oh he is not ever going to force anyone
100:39
to take a vaccine if they don't want
100:41
that vaccine
100:43
he absolutely is not espec
100:46
especially with the input he's had
100:49
recently
100:50
about the people who are trying to
100:52
create it
100:54
now i will say he has some viable people
100:58
who care
100:59
who are trying to work on a solution but
101:01
the ones that have been offered to him
101:03
already
101:04
he has said no
101:06
[Applause]
101:09
after he looked at it he said it's worse
101:14
this is worse than the virus
101:18
and he literally had high up at the ups
101:21
bring him this formula that was actually
101:23
created and made
101:25
this will help everybody in america
101:28
to not have this virus and he goes after
101:31
he took it and studied all but he had
101:33
people study it and they went you don't
101:35
want this this is bad this isn't
101:37
bad it'll make them worse if they take
101:40
it some people may die from taking it
101:43
why and so we told them i'm not taking
101:46
that
101:47
no that they're better off just to make
101:49
it through even on their own
101:51
than to take this stuff he doesn't want
101:54
to us
101:56
and if he hadn't listened to people that
101:58
he trusted
102:00
and a person in his place who only
102:02
thinks good
102:04
and he wants to help right he wants to
102:07
build up
102:08
he wants to help us to be better there's
102:10
nothing that's been done that he
102:12
intentionally did to hurt us it was
102:15
people who were
102:16
lying to him that were fired
102:21
he fired the world health organization
102:25
flat out fired him
102:28
[Applause]
102:30
said he was he wasn't taking any of
102:32
their advice anymore
102:35
and then there were some people in the
102:37
center cdc
102:39
the center for disease control
102:44
he is about to fire some more
102:48
[Applause]
102:51
that's see when he started asking the
102:54
people
102:55
and not certain professionals supposed
102:57
to be the best in their field
102:59
and and i'm i'm always sending him stuff
103:02
i send stuff
103:03
to donald jr other place and i say
103:06
why is your father listening to people
103:10
who hate him
103:13
some of these were liberals why would he
103:15
believe
103:16
them and they're trying to act like
103:18
they're helping
103:20
they still hate him and they want to
103:23
destroy everything he's trying to do
103:25
he does not need to listen to those
103:27
people
103:29
i don't care who they are i don't care
103:31
what their certifications are
103:33
i don't care what they have proved that
103:35
they can do those people
103:37
hated him before it came they are now
103:40
trying to use it against him
103:43
i'm sure i'm not the only one who was
103:45
telling him that and so he fired a whole
103:48
bunch of them
103:50
i said you these people which is truth
103:53
right
103:54
these people who have plotted and
103:55
planned against him from the beginning
103:57
didn't become good overnight because oh
103:59
we can now help
104:01
the country that wasn't their plan
104:04
they have used it they have literally
104:07
used it
104:08
they are hoping that we will still be
104:10
all
104:11
in our homes don't you love that we are
104:13
in this together
104:14
oh no we're not in this together
104:18
i'm sure you're not doing stuff that
104:20
you're telling i'm not talking about
104:21
trump i'm talking about the other people
104:23
who want to put that image out there we
104:26
need to stay
104:26
separated to protect one another you
104:28
know our immune system goes down
104:31
we need to be together it builds your
104:34
immune i
104:35
i also sent that message i also sent
104:37
that message to him
104:39
why don't you go check out the immune
104:40
system and find out i do it very nicely
104:43
find out
104:44
are we good when we're together are we
104:46
good when we isolate ourselves
104:50
when we are together and the one thing
104:52
he did find out and he did start
104:54
questioning
104:54
how come kids aren't getting this why
104:57
are not real young people
104:59
not getting it it's because they play
105:02
together
105:03
they play together they run together
105:05
they are together
105:06
but i think the worst thing that was
105:08
presented to him that he actually
105:09
laughed them
105:10
out of the interview that we will come
105:12
in your home
105:13
and arrest you if you're not wearing a
105:15
mask in your home you might give it to
105:17
your kids
105:18
that was something they wanted past
105:23
i have found this out about the devil
105:26
when he thinks he's one he gets
105:29
sloppy and this is can
105:32
be proven even in the word when satan
105:35
thinks he's
105:36
one by controlling people he'll do
105:38
stupid things
105:41
forgive me if i said that word but you
105:42
know i don't know what else to call it
105:44
they do very intelligent
105:45
unintelligent things because they're fed
105:49
they're being fed to do whatever they
105:52
have to do
105:53
criminal acts violence to make sure that
105:58
he
105:58
doesn't win because they don't want god
106:01
in the white house that's the truth
106:02
so whatever they can find they're
106:04
selling
106:06
parts of the soul to the enemy they're
106:08
getting people to do
106:09
to do it they're buying people to do
106:12
things
106:14
the thing that's not intelligent is when
106:16
you pay
106:17
people to do the dirty jobs and people
106:20
start getting caught
106:21
who will scream the loudest
106:25
the minion you found and paid to do your
106:29
dirty work and they know you did it
106:32
that's how the dominoes are gonna fall
106:35
and all these people at the top of this
106:37
mess and i mean it is crazy right now in
106:41
washington dc we just heard from our
106:43
friend
106:45
this absolutely has to be exposed and
106:48
some of it is
106:49
numbers and some of let me tell you
106:50
they're gathering
106:52
you may notice he's gathering
106:54
information
106:55
to get people imprisoned
107:00
but people who do this because their
107:03
influence the enemy doesn't care who
107:04
falls
107:06
he doesn't he's using them to stop
107:08
something he doesn't
107:10
want and he doesn't want god in this p
107:12
in this country he doesn't want
107:14
freedom liberty and justice of any kind
107:17
in this country so
107:18
he has focused himself
107:22
on all this other stuff to bring all the
107:24
stuff in to put
107:25
fear in us or thinking the end is here
107:28
that there and take hope away from
107:30
people you know
107:32
no matter what it costs and people have
107:34
behind closed doors
107:36
lied the other thing they did that was
107:38
not until they made them sign documents
107:42
oh these people they paid off they made
107:43
them sign documents that they were
107:45
willing to do this
107:47
that's not smart
107:50
if you're going to do something like
107:51
that you don't get anybody's names on
107:52
nothing
107:53
you don't take pictures you don't keep
107:55
records where they're doing it all
107:58
what they're building god said is
108:01
evidence against their self
108:04
and it's already too late to try to stop
108:08
it
108:11
they've gone too far they can't go back
108:16
it's too late to escape getting caught
108:20
so i hope that answered your question
108:24
i take one one more question what
108:34
there is to be no second wave of the
108:36
virus
108:40
and they will try i will tell you that's
108:42
from him
108:43
that's from him when they already
108:46
started talking about the second wave
108:48
coming before
108:49
the first one was kind of here
108:52
but in the natural world when a virus
108:55
comes in
108:56
it's introduced it goes around and then
108:58
it begins to die
109:00
out because eventually
109:03
with virus you build immunities against
109:05
it
109:07
then in the natural this happens so
109:10
we would naturally begin to build
109:12
immunities in our own body
109:14
it's not like a second wave can't happen
109:17
the only thing that could affect was
109:18
maybe a few people who are infirmed or
109:22
something like that that never had it
109:24
before
109:25
that might happen but there is no mass
109:27
second wave
109:30
oh in the food
109:35
there they will try because this was all
109:38
created
109:41
the virus thing was created it was
109:44
absolutely created in
109:47
elaborate i can just elaborate that it
109:48
was created in china in a lab
109:52
it was cr it was created
109:55
because china is not happy with us
109:59
they're communist and they have been
110:04
sucking us dry with
110:07
no honor for us
110:11
for america taking what they could take
110:14
and god told me
110:15
years ago the ones who've been stealing
110:19
in the business industry in the energy
110:22
industry who've been stealing from
110:23
america
110:24
will be brought down and will not ever
110:26
be able to do that again that was
110:27
probably 10 years ago
110:29
he told me that those who've been doing
110:31
that and using
110:33
and abusing because they used us because
110:36
in in toys in clothing
110:40
and home accessories they put asbestos
110:43
they put let on purpose
110:46
in their products they were shipping
110:48
here
110:50
kids crayons toys
110:54
and they did it on purpose
110:57
and the other thing you need to know is
110:59
this i know they have some beautiful
111:01
things they put from that place
111:02
but if you see detail like in fabrics
111:05
and beautiful jewelry
111:06
they pay five-year-old children to do
111:08
that
111:12
never has there been such a mass abuse
111:15
of children as in that country
111:19
and these things some people have been
111:21
getting and they talk about how amazing
111:23
it is
111:24
children were in factories forced to do
111:27
that
111:29
they have no care for humanity
111:34
and all they saw us is a money
111:38
and they would bake companies to come
111:40
over there
111:41
you'll be able to sell this so cheap but
111:44
the way it was put together
111:45
was i've looked at designers clothes and
111:47
called them
111:48
and said i used to buy on the sale rack
111:51
of course
111:52
if i liked a designer's clothes but when
111:54
they went and looked at them hugo now
111:56
on all the many clearance racks our
111:59
designer clothes
112:00
the threads are falling apart they're
112:02
not staying together
112:04
the fabrics are not good because these
112:07
designers are selling out or else their
112:09
managers are selling out their designs
112:11
to china
112:13
and every one of them say china i don't
112:16
buy anything
112:17
i will literally look at every label
112:19
whether it's
112:20
food products whether it's things to
112:22
make foods in
112:24
whether stuff to wear i don't care i
112:26
will not get it
112:28
i won't buy it because i don't trust
112:30
them
112:31
and when it was finally discovered about
112:33
the asbestos well they had to re-change
112:35
their home market
112:37
but then the lead was put in there and
112:39
there was one other thing i can't
112:40
remember what it was
112:41
three major things huh
112:44
what was it oh i remember when they put
112:48
in the pet food and the pets were dying
112:51
yeah they they'll put in anything to get
112:54
money but
112:55
the thing is this the name on those bags
112:58
are people we trust that make stuff
113:02
and i tell you the gmo stuff is not fake
113:04
either
113:07
you can't get you can't buy stuff this
113:09
genetically
113:10
modified or genetically engineered it
113:13
has
113:14
absolutely no nutrition
113:18
and big companies that like kellogg's
113:21
and nabisco
113:22
and they're sending their stuff to
113:24
mexico to be made
113:27
or china del monte sends stuff to china
113:33
and you better look at the grocery shops
113:34
when you're shopping god's given me a
113:36
news and media platform which this is
113:38
part of what i'm sharing right now with
113:40
you
113:40
but we will be telling the truth and
113:42
have facts to give you
113:43
and it will be one of the shows that we
113:45
put on our we we produce
113:48
news and media we'll be sharing all
113:50
these things that are harmful but what
113:52
is good you need to know what is good
113:54
there are manufacturers that are doing
113:56
really good stuff
113:57
that taste just as good annie's i know
114:01
annie's has really good stuff
114:03
people's but because still got to look
114:04
at the label make sure it may even say
114:07
uh
114:08
organic make sure it set doesn't have on
114:10
those on the side
114:11
genetically or partially genetically
114:14
engineered
114:15
or genetically modified means what
114:17
they're doing is they're taking the
114:18
seeds
114:19
and stripping away the value of them so
114:21
the products can be bigger or look
114:23
better
114:24
but there's no nutrition in them and
114:27
people
114:27
we need to be educated in that too and
114:30
even in the natural realm about things
114:32
so
114:33
make sure what you're wearing is safe
114:37
and they they make furniture that says
114:39
in california they make them put a label
114:41
this meets the standards for asbestos
114:44
in this piece of furniture that has not
114:47
exceeded the limits we allow
114:50
i i don't want anything with asbestos in
114:52
it
114:54
okay and you had your did you have your
114:58
hand up
114:59
one more then we got to stop because
115:01
it's 10.
115:05
how does israel play in the part of
115:08
america what god is doing with america
115:10
well i can tell you this because i
115:12
already do know this
115:14
that many orthodox jews will be doing
115:17
business with americans
115:21
i will also say this to you i don't know
115:23
not maybe not so much
115:25
there are jews in this country if
115:27
anybody watches the fake news they're
115:28
going to get corrupted
115:30
they just need to people not if they
115:32
don't watch it all the time not so bad
115:34
but if they feed off of all that lies it
115:36
can it can
115:37
you know compromises the word the holy
115:40
spirit said it can compromise your soul
115:43
and jews in israel are wild
115:47
about our precedent i know i wore this
115:51
shirt
115:52
on my last day i was there for 10 or 12
115:54
days i don't remember masada being
115:56
reminded
115:57
if i have a hard day he'll say masada
115:59
because i had to climb that
116:03
i was invited by steve schultz i think
116:04
it was a 12-day tour
116:06
and i thought you know nice hotel
116:09
speak the platform
116:13
he dragged me all over every day
116:17
for eight hours okay and you had to
116:20
catch the bus like at seven a.m
116:22
i hadn't even gone to bed yet
116:26
because i could have been at seven and
116:27
then i wake up around 11.
116:29
but they didn't haul me anywhere at
116:31
night they dragged me everywhere in the
116:32
daytime and i'm like
116:33
i lost 15 pounds i cherry tomatoes in
116:36
little rolls because i don't like kosher
116:38
food i'm so sorry jesus
116:39
i don't want it
116:43
but they dragged me out to the bus every
116:44
day and they hooked a mic
116:46
on me and had a cameraman follow me
116:49
and they they know i'm a seer so every
116:51
place like i spoke on the sea of galilee
116:54
and i commanded the fog to lift and it
116:56
was gone
116:56
and i went on mark carmel and told
116:59
people what i saw in the spirit realm
117:00
and it was all recorded about the fire
117:02
that's still there the fire angels that
117:03
are still there
117:05
about uh you know the tomb where the two
117:07
angels were inside and the people saw
117:09
them they're still posted right there
117:12
and he taped 18 times
117:15
of taking me to all these key places in
117:18
the bible to tell people what i saw in
117:20
the spirit realm
117:22
so he bushwhacked me because i didn't
117:25
find out until i got there
117:26
i have to go out in the heat and sweat
117:29
and climb mountains
117:31
or go underground a mile where king
117:34
david's
117:35
house was it was powerful seeing that
117:38
stuff i'm like that's my only time
117:40
unless you take me in the spirit you
117:41
know thank god they had my husband come
117:44
he had to haul me up everywhere okay
117:46
and the camels um take mouth spray and
117:49
spray it for you to talk to the camel
117:51
come on
117:52
that's a free tip from me okay
117:55
israel is always going to be key
117:59
and those are still god's chosen people
118:01
they were the first
118:03
people on this planet who believed
118:06
for god and they still
118:10
stand for that same god that we love
118:14
they don't have jesus but now we
118:17
had for our god who one met when wendy
118:20
alec took me to israel a long time ago
118:22
and did a television show with her for
118:24
three days and
118:25
the first time i think i taught about
118:27
losing from the soul
118:29
was on her on god tv
118:32
so i went back and she hired a guide to
118:35
take us to all the inside places where
118:36
nobody got to go on tours we had a
118:38
private guide
118:39
and when we went on this whole bus tour
118:41
all over the place
118:43
that was the guy who was our guide the
118:44
same one yoshi
118:47
yeah he remembered me
118:50
so we'd go places and he'd give his
118:52
speech right head knowledge
118:54
about the country of israel and then
118:56
when he was done i'd get up there and
118:57
speak about
119:01
the spirit realm and what i knew about
119:03
stuff
119:04
and he's like uh he didn't know i'd be
119:06
speaking i went there there
119:08
they brought me to do that so well i'll
119:10
just watch
119:12
by the third day he could not help stay
119:15
because god was speaking about
119:16
his people and today
119:20
how powerful they'll be in the earth
119:22
what good friends they'll be with
119:23
america
119:24
this is not the time for their
119:27
persecution
119:28
yet that those days
119:31
can't come right now because of these
119:33
are the days of blessing and greatness
119:36
and coming together right and so the
119:39
persecution
119:40
people are always going to hate them
119:42
because the devil hey sam
119:44
but god's got so many new blessings for
119:46
them how about that for the first time
119:48
they were recognized
119:51
in the world by a leading nation
119:54
that israel was uh that and then he put
119:58
the capital in jerusalem when he voted
120:01
for that to happen
120:04
they gave us a brand new embassy in
120:06
israel three
120:07
times bigger i even got to see it before
120:09
they actually finished it
120:11
so if you were a christian and you liked
120:14
trump you had five star favor
120:19
and i thought i'm gonna just see what
120:21
happens the holy spirit said wear your
120:22
trump shirt
120:24
in the jewish quarter where they don't
120:26
really want people to come but you can
120:27
kind of walk through it
120:29
my husband would be witness they were
120:31
stopping me
120:32
taking their pictures with the orthodox
120:34
jews
120:36
with the hat that everything they wanted
120:39
their picture
120:40
they couldn't you know speaking who they
120:42
would point at trump
120:44
and they would get their camera and i go
120:47
yeah sure so all over
120:50
israel pictures of this pink-haired
120:53
person
120:55
with one of the most important people in
120:57
israel because we have protected them we
120:59
have helped them
121:00
we have blessed them and when you bless
121:04
israel you can't escape blessings
121:08
and god and god had me prophesy
121:12
because these orthodox jews would gather
121:14
around where our meetings were all
121:16
outside they were not inside in a nice
121:18
ac
121:19
place they would come around the border
121:22
of where they were seated or where i was
121:23
speaking
121:24
even the ones with the big guns and
121:26
they'd stay in there and listen
121:28
because they could speak english and
121:30
they heard me talk about what god
121:32
the god of heaven and earth thought
121:34
about them and what his plans were for
121:36
them
121:37
and they they would start to cry
121:40
and they weren't invited but they came
121:42
anyway so wearing this shirt was the
121:44
best thing i got to do
121:46
even in the airport in the israel
121:48
israeli airport they were stopping me
121:51
the jews were stopping to take pictures
121:53
of trump and uh
121:56
so yeah and um by the end of the tour
122:00
that guide who was our orthodox jewish
122:03
god
122:03
could not wait to hear what i was going
122:06
to say about these places in
122:08
in israel and they claim that jesus let
122:10
himself down
122:11
the mount of the precipice where they
122:13
were going to throw the crowds were
122:14
going to throw them over
122:15
but jesus walked through them he stepped
122:19
in the spirit round and walked through
122:20
the people
122:22
but what they tell people is he put a
122:24
rope down and climbed down the side of
122:26
the mountain
122:27
so that's what the guy said and then i
122:29
got up there
122:32
i said well revelation on that that
122:35
could be a possibility
122:36
in the natural but that's not what god
122:38
was doing with his son
122:40
his son had the ability the spirit realm
122:42
was around us there's openings
122:44
in it and when you step in
122:47
you can see and hear everybody but
122:48
nobody can see you
122:50
and you walk through the physical
122:52
buildings the physical
122:54
people they can't see you they can't
122:56
hear you
122:57
and that's what he did he walked through
122:59
the people it even says that in the
123:00
bible
123:02
so i pretty much gave revelation on
123:04
everything
123:06
it was quite an experience
123:10
for me who you know my i want my mailbox
123:13
on the door
123:14
so i don't have to walk outside to go do
123:15
it i am a 50 step a day person
123:19
i think i did 50 000 steps on that trip
123:23
make sure if it's a pilgrimage tour you
123:26
will never be out
123:27
you'll never be inside it won't be
123:30
comfortable it won't be convenient but
123:32
it'll be life-changing
123:34
and i i think stand up because i wanted
123:37
to clear over everybody stand up
123:41

123:45

[Applause]

[Music]
00:33
[Applause]
00:38
thank you
00:39
one moment I was yelling too much when
00:48
you're a seer you see everything is
00:50
going on there's different levels of
00:53
seers is about to be a new school the
00:56
Prophet started the seer school of the
00:58
prophets the new Eagles that God is
01:02
raising up here there's a difference in
01:04
I know prophets are called Eagles also
01:06
the prophets because you know we're in a
01:08
new time so God's bringing new and the
01:12
new will be see your prophets because it
01:14
changes everything when you see what's
01:16
happening you hear but you see it and
01:19
this is what the Holy Spirit said in the
01:23
past the seer not this year but the
01:25
Prophet Eagles would fly high to see
01:29
what to do what was going on but the
01:31
seer prophets see before they fly they
01:35
already know where to go and what's
01:36
going on and I was standing over there
01:42
about 20 minutes or so ago and and the
01:45
Lord was outside those windows and he
01:48
said my train is about to fill this
01:52
temple
01:56
before before they started saying it is
02:01
that my train is going to fill this
02:03
temple it's going to be rocked and I'm
02:09
telling you angels by the hundreds and
02:12
thousands began to jump in spin in slide
02:16
in there was so much water
02:20
I just wanted to yell it's raining I was
02:22
yelled it's raining grab the rain grab
02:25
the rain because they were they were
02:27
just sliding in the water was coming in
02:30
from everywhere it was from heaven it
02:32
was water coming from heaven and they
02:33
were jumping on here not just here they
02:36
were actually doing that in heaven
02:38
because they were celebrating what was
02:40
going on here so what happened was we
02:42
literally connected with heaven in the
02:46
workshop and I would I would hear the
02:49
Lord say things before deed he would
02:51
declare it or he would sing it he was
02:54
saying it so they were hearing literally
02:56
in their spirit what he was saying and
02:58
that's what we need to do in our
03:00
services amen
03:01
we should let him have his way I can
03:04
hear all of heaven just yelling he is
03:07
holy he is worthy we were singing that
03:10
song together that was not just us that
03:13
was heaven singing with us and then and
03:15
then I know where they are the ones with
03:18
the blue fire in their hair started
03:20
coming in and spinning over people the
03:22
Seraphim were coming in I probably never
03:25
seemed to serve them come in anywhere
03:27
and I'm sure they do because they're
03:29
over the throne of God and I kept
03:31
thinking why are they here why did they
03:33
look up there and the throne of God was
03:35
outside the window
03:40
anyway and I understood I understood why
03:44
they were in here literally they like
03:47
loop over you and they're here their
03:49
heads on fire with this holy fire and
03:52
holiness was flooding this place it was
03:55
going into your souls you've had so many
03:58
deposits in your soul just from being
04:00
here during the worship and so he gained
04:03
his throne appeared to serve him
04:05
actually came in and where they were
04:06
just flying over top of everybody just
04:09
reach up and say I take it it's mine in
04:22
this time there will be so many seers
04:24
he's going to open people's eyes even
04:27
people who never saw before he's
04:29
establishing a new level of discernment
04:32
in the earth in his body the seer
04:35
anointing is going to just be going
04:37
everywhere because it does change things
04:41
when you see it really does because you
04:43
know it's accurate you know what you're
04:46
seeing is act but you know that it's God
04:48
moving and so we definitely in a new
04:50
time and I'm telling you I've already
04:53
gotten some he came and gave you some
04:55
orders for this service of what to do
04:57
what to declare what to call in and so
05:03
we just thank you Father for honoring us
05:05
Lord honoring us with your presence Holy
05:08
Spirit honoring us with your presence we
05:10
think heaven for showing up and showing
05:12
off in here today worshiping with us
05:15
having fun with us we thank you we thank
05:19
you for that father this is a fun time
05:23
and at the same time this is the holy
05:25
time and a lot of people I know when I
05:28
started speaking up some of the body had
05:30
a problem seeing themselves as being fun
05:33
or funny and that being holy but it's
05:36
part of being holy I mean why wouldn't
05:39
you have fun if you were free from any
05:42
effects of the enemy or the world or man
05:45
whatsoever you will have more fun than
05:47
you've ever had in your life
05:49
and that's why we need to be wholly
05:50
conscious we need to be wholly conscious
05:54
right I mean and he's also sharing with
05:56
me that whole thing everyone says and
05:59
they don't even know what they're saying
06:01
for all have sinned and come short of
06:03
the glory you need to look at what says
06:05
on the second half of that where where
06:08
has that sin come from because we're
06:10
coming short of the glory and I know
06:13
probably some people don't understand
06:14
that the glory is the power of God and
06:17
we on this search is supposed to belong
06:19
to him we're supposed to be
06:20
demonstrating that power releasing that
06:22
power and we have come short of it a lot
06:25
of people come sorbets because they're
06:26
playing in the world they're playing in
06:28
the enemy's camp and they can't even see
06:31
what they're miss and they can't see who
06:33
they're supposed to be and so I know
06:34
people try to use it for all different
06:36
reasons or you know often have sinned
06:39
and come short of the glory but you can
06:41
get to a place where you don't come
06:43
short of the glory that you are filled
06:45
with the glory yet you're the fullness
06:46
of the glory because the knowledge of
06:48
the glory that ploy double covers will
06:52
be done by those who are filled with it
06:53
who are full of it for releasing it
06:56
we're imparting it and you are not
06:58
coming short of the glory amen
07:00
we should never come short of the glory
07:03
it's what he's offered is this what he's
07:06
given us to represent him in this earth
07:09
and so we need to concentrate and be
07:12
serious about getting all that we can
07:14
get karey all that we can carry and let
07:17
me tell you if there's any of any me and
07:19
you you can't carry the glory okay we
07:22
can't carry it because Christ when he
07:24
walked this earth he had none of the
07:26
enemy in him so right now we're going to
07:29
stand up and I'm going to declare some
07:31
things and then you're gonna yell we
07:32
agree father I speak now to the body of
07:39
Christ those who are running those who
07:43
are fighting those who are sitting does
07:46
it were blind those who are confused
07:48
those who are true for the enemy I call
07:52
you forth for the kingdom of darkness
07:55
and in the kingdom of play it's time for
07:57
you to get here stand up stand up for
08:01
him
08:01
let go of your shackles let go of your
08:04
blinders don't be blind don't be
08:07
confused don't be trapped because he
08:10
will not tolerate not put up with
08:13
Pharmacia ruling over people abortion
08:17
ruling over people not semantics mulling
08:20
over people
08:21
evil ruling over his people he will cut
08:24
down every weed and it will be burned up
08:28
by the fire of his presence he will not
08:31
tolerate it in this state in this
08:34
country he is going to deal with it he's
08:36
gonna deal all that is not right he
08:39
going to set it right and those who call
08:42
themselves as leaders that are lying
08:44
they're cheating they're living sin and
08:48
pouring into the congregation you have
08:50
days you have weeks left to make it
08:53
right with him or he will remove you
08:55
from this earth he will not tolerate you
08:58
saying you represent him and you walk in
09:01
ungodliness and you say he is your God
09:04
he will not know you if you do not
09:06
change your ways you will not live to
09:09
see the day of his glory on this earth
09:11
so repent and come back to him if you
09:15
want to live and not die
09:17
[Applause]
09:27
you were appointed by God to carry the
09:30
glory but will their glory expose you or
09:33
will you carry it because he will not
09:35
tolerate you using his name and making
09:39
his name something that is bad and evil
09:41
yes he sees your sin and just because he
09:45
doesn't say anything doesn't mean he's
09:47
not going to do anything because he's
09:49
saying to stay an hour you better change
09:51
your ways and change your life if you
09:54
want to remain on this earth because he
09:56
won't let you carry the glory
09:57
he won't you miss us he won't you
10:00
demonstrate he will replace you and take
10:02
your place from you
10:05

23:01
that's who shall help us to be that's
23:04
who we are we're not just somebody weak
23:08
we're not somebody who's wimpy we're not
23:12
someone who was a doormat he never
23:14
called us a doormat he never called any
23:16
of us a doormat
23:19
we've always been above you should have
23:23
to look up and see yourself there
23:25
you've always been seated and have any
23:28
places with Christ you've always been
23:30
there from the time you gave yourself to
23:33
him he took a layer of your soul which
23:35
is an image of you and he seeded it with
23:37
him in heavenly places the mysteries are
23:42
about to be revealed like never before
23:43
the secrets of the heart of God about to
23:46
be given to his children you can't be
23:52
mean the same when you know him this
23:59
earth will become more and more
24:00
spiritually minded
24:06
even if people not understand it it
24:08
can't stop it from happening
24:11
angels will be everywhere
24:13
and people will see them there will be
24:19
some unfortunately they don't care that
24:22
would rather partner with the other side
24:25
it's important that you become connected
24:27
in the spirit like totally consumed by
24:30
the holy spirit completely consumed by
24:33
the holy spirit we're living in a time
24:44
of forced change not just for our
24:48
country but for us as the body of Christ
24:49
you even out there listening if you've
24:57
been playing or riding on the fence or
24:59
you haven't quite sure what you want to
25:02
do with your life you need to run to him
25:06
no divine encounters no heaven
25:09
encounters will ever take the place of
25:11
knowing him it is because of him it is
25:14
for him and is by him that we get to do
25:17
this you can't leave him out of your
25:20
life you can't find a substitute for him
25:24
no false religion will do it no lives or
25:28
deception will do it no matter what they
25:29
tell you no one goes to heaven without
25:33
Christ he is the only one he's paid a
25:38
price but he wants you he wants you to
25:45
know him even you belong to him he wants
25:48
you to know him those who don't know him
25:51
he really wants you to know him because
25:54
great shakings are taking place in the
25:56
earth the great shakings are for the
26:00
good they're for God right now but there
26:05
will come a day even far into the future
26:08
that the shaking will not be good
26:14
I've seen those days although he doesn't
26:19

26:23

26:56
the mountains have them jump into the
26:57
sea you're not raising children you are
27:01
shaping souls that will touch this world
27:06

27:09

27:15

27:26
earth now from heaven he ascending here

yeah
36:23
[Applause]
36:26
let's let that roar go around this world
36:30
bother everyone who hears this everyone
36:32
who is listening
36:34
why don't you ah
36:36
[Applause]
36:52
it puts fear in the heart of the enemy
36:55
it terrifies he'll let it be fear in the
37:00
heart of every evil winner of any nation
37:03
God let the begin to crumble with a fear
37:07
of the Lord upon them that their days
37:09
are numbered in this world the eve
37:16
declare freedom and liberty of justice
37:19
in America and around this world for all
37:22
of their people God let freedom ring
37:31
father any man amen hallelujah amen amen
37:45
you can sit down
38:02
anytime I'm somewhere and his throne
38:05
shows up he is going to say something he
38:14
wants to speak to everybody he wants
38:18
everyone to know he does love you
38:20
we're supposed to represent love always
38:23
but we're not supposed to participate or
38:26
tolerate care or violence not in your
38:30
life not in your city not in your
38:33
country God is against violence it is
38:39
going to be dealt with harshly not just
38:42
by our president but what he will do is
38:45
he will cause others to stand up and do
38:47
the same thing because then they when
38:50
they see someone stand up who carries
38:52
justice and liberty and freedom that
38:55
will cause that to be spread into their
38:57
soul and to begin to hunger for that for
39:00
the country and they will stand up and
39:02
be bold you will begin to see laws
39:04
changing and things being abolished
39:06
around this world because God has
39:09
someone he chose to sit as the highest
39:11
level of our land that will not leave
39:14
him out
39:16
[Applause]
39:23
he's creating a pattern in our country
39:26
you'll see a lot of things change don't
39:30
be concerned that Trump is going to jump
39:34
off God's train because he knows he
39:38
should say her because of him
39:42
she has a very defined plan that he will
39:46
work out and if someone tries to come in
39:50
if a wolf tries to come in to the Sheep
39:52
pen of his cabinet he will know it and
39:55
they will be fired God said that
40:02
something he's really good at doing he
40:06
doesn't have a problem saying you are
40:08
fired
40:08
he doesn't care what your position in
40:10
how long you've been there how important
40:12
you think you are if you're doing
40:14
something that's not right he will fire
40:16
you never in the history of our country
40:27
has the president had so many friends as
40:30
believers and so much Council that are
40:34
believers and he sought them out his
40:45
wife is burning for Jesus Christ
40:48
[Music]
40:52
we've never had a first lady like her
40:56
never God is going to cause honor to be
41:02
shown her even by people that didn't
41:05
like her or denied her words are just as
41:12
important as her husband's because they
41:14
are one so keep watching for her to say
41:19
powerful things I rejoice every time she
41:22
says anything and she looks really good
41:27
saying it it doesn't matter what the
41:41
liberal media says many of their
41:44
networks will go under
41:53
they do not know what truth is they have
41:58
so deceived their souls and filled lies
42:01
in their own souls they can't see truth
42:04
and this is a time when he's not going
42:07
to allow lies being put to the Airways
42:10
because the frequencies that are being
42:12
put there they're our kids
42:16
he's taken over the frequencies the
42:19
sounds the waves the words the images
42:24
he's taking all of them and if they
42:29
promote the darkness they will not
42:31
remain God will raise up powerful
42:39
networks that we can trust that we can
42:42
believe it will be fair that will love
42:46
him many changes are coming over the
42:52
next couple years and for the next
42:55
twenty four years it won't stop coming
42:59
[Applause]
43:01
because at the end of the twenty four
43:04
years he would have set in place those
43:06
he wants to be in leadership those who
43:09
will be handling the wealth those who
43:11
will be treasure chest to others to help
43:13
complete people's visions those who will
43:16
build for the kingdom entire cities not
43:19
just some buildings those will help set
43:21
the body of Christ free from debt who
43:25
will help to pay off the national debt
43:29
those who will help build the third
43:32
temple in Israel that his son will sit
43:39
on one day many firsts are about to
43:46
happen because we are in the last days
43:49
but not the last day it would be the
43:52
first it would see some of the last
43:55
there will be some of the greatest
43:56
things that happen on this earth these
44:00
are powerful days days to be excited to
44:04
celebrate someone actually said there's
44:07
no one in the Bible that says the word
44:08
celebration they're missing everything
44:21
because they're not looking for
44:23
something from God they're looking to
44:27
tweak everybody they think is wrong
44:29
because you're staying in their box of
44:32
legalism and self-righteousness so they
44:38
don't want to receive what God is saying
44:39
so they look for everything they came to
44:42
tear down what'd he say if you have
44:45
friends like that get new friends
44:51
pray for them but get new friends and
44:55
this time you need to run with those who
44:58
are like-minded like they were saying we
45:01
who are like-minded that wants you
45:03
helped establish the spiritual kingdom
45:06
of heaven and deserve heaven will still
45:10
be in heaven but it's invading this
45:14
earth and it's not for a revival it is
45:19
for a habitation
45:20
[Applause]
45:26
revivals man always mess where they mess
45:29
with them they want to control them they
45:32
want to put them in a box they want to
45:34
keep it the way that was and not
45:35
changing me or do anything new where you
45:38
can't touch a habitation I'd like to see
45:47
anyone unseat heaven from inhabiting
45:50
this earth because no one is running
45:55
into heaven stealing these Ramat from
46:01
the time of John the Baptist until now
46:03
the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence
46:05
and the violent take it by force does
46:08
not mean people are running into heaven
46:10
and bringing violence they're talking
46:13
about a spiritual violence that word
46:16
suffers in that scripture means they
46:19
caused it it means the same thing that
46:27
this scripture does suffer the little
46:30
children to come unto me does not mean
46:33
violence and means caused them to come
46:37
encourage them to come so let's say that
46:41
from the time of John the Baptist until
46:44
now the Kingdom of Heaven has been
46:46
causing violence on the insides of
46:49
believers spiritual violence to take
46:52
back from the enemy to take it by force
46:55
because they have no right to it
46:57
[Applause]
47:01
that's what that scripture means that
47:05
makes sense
47:08
the only violence she tolerates is
47:11
through violence and he's causing it
47:13
inside of us because we have had it with
47:16
the devil we've had it with man trying
47:19
to tell us what we can do and cannot do
47:21
when God made this earth and he gave it
47:23
to us the enemy tried to put violence in
47:33
the streets for God's about the
47:34
unleashing spiritual violence in in the
47:40
streets where hell has been ruling and
47:44
they will find no place to rule anymore
47:49
[Applause]
47:59
in 1965 God showed me these days and I
48:07
have patiently longingly waited to see
48:11
them man I've known a lot for a very
48:16
long time but he wouldn't let me speak
48:19
about it
48:22
a lot of self-control which my father
48:28
had and my grandmother had because they
48:30
saw those days he told me many many many
48:37
years ago that there will be a president
48:39
sitting in the White House that will
48:41
extend their hand to the believers and
48:45
they will build like they never built
48:48
before they'll be wealthy like they
48:51
never were wealthy before they will have
48:53
a say in the seat of the government and
48:56
to the head of the government their
48:59
permanence will not be withheld any
49:02
longer you will not have delays in what
49:04
you want to do you'll be freed of
49:06
minister free to talk free to walk free
49:10
to build free to do what he's told you
49:12
to do and he is about to take some of
49:23
the most unlikely people and give him
49:29
some of the greatest things in the land
49:33
because he can trust their hearts they
49:35
will not be qualified by man because men
49:41
never qualifies the chosen but God
49:46
qualifies the chosen a man you will not
49:56
have to live up to me and standards for
49:59
what they think you have to be to have
50:01
something or do something
50:04
[Applause]
50:11
some of the wisest people that will walk
50:13
this earth probably don't even have a
50:16
12th grade education but neither has it
50:26
been filled with man's ideas or belief
50:31
systems from universities but they can
50:38
fear purely and freely hear God's voice
50:41
and they will shock heads of Nations
50:46
kings and presidents will come to get
50:49
wisdom from them so if you're sitting on
50:53
your little house on a no-name Street
50:59
all I can say is get ready because a lot
51:07
of the people he's going to use will be
51:10
those who've loved him who sacrificed
51:12
who have never given up doesn't mean we
51:16
didn't make mistakes just means we never
51:18
gave up we didn't abandon him and he did
51:22
not abandon us and man the great
51:26
learners wise people will still be
51:29
trying to figure it out when they're
51:30
left behind in the dust and people are
51:33
running but for everyday people who know
51:36
their God to receive wisdom from they
51:40
will be invited to speak in these
51:41
learning places or these wise people
51:46
used to come and speak that never
51:49
changed their lives it never gave him
51:51
hope they never showed them who they
51:53
really were
51:53
and they'll be welcomed and sought after
51:57
not just in this nation but around the
52:00
world because he loves to confuse the
52:06
why
52:15
it's going to be a wonderful time to
52:18
live you I look forward to it every day
52:21
I wake up if I go to sleep because
52:28
what's coming not too far down the road
52:30
is when you step into what he wants
52:32
there'll be a point in your life where
52:34
you don't have to eat to live you won't
52:38
have to sleep to live because on earth
52:43
as it is in heaven
52:50
more and more I just don't want food
52:53
because he is my food he is the air I
52:56
bruton and no one can take it away fear
53:02
is about to leave the body of Christ
53:07
[Music]
53:09
when I say use greatest weapons is fear
53:12
he's always used it fear is about to
53:16
fall on hell fear is about to fall on
53:19
the enemy there is already following on
53:22
the army of darkness because now the
53:24
hosts have commanders and there they are
53:27
beat up and shredded continually because
53:31
we have step into our rightful place to
53:33
come in the host of heaven which was
53:36
God's plan all along
53:39
don't swing back from taking that title
53:43
God said in the word and mentions the
53:47
captain of the host and the Lord of the
53:49
hosts because we are the commanders of
53:52
the hosts
53:54
they harken under the word of the Lord
53:56
he sends them down here so he can send
53:59
them on assignment if God Himself says
54:02
command ye me why would he care if you
54:05
were commanding the army that is not
54:10
worshipping angels no general is
54:14
worshiping their troops they're giving
54:24
them orders that they need in order to
54:27
be strategic in their warfare the hosts
54:34
do not have power over all the power the
54:36
enemy but we do they can do little to
54:43
help us and generally have in areas they
54:46
have in certain situations they have in
54:49
the past but in this time in this new
54:51
time we are to command them and send
54:53
them on assignment because when you take
54:57
truly take power and every way over all
55:03
the part of the enemy nothing by any
55:06
means shall harm you because they will
55:09
see the army that is with you
55:15
it is not our job to fight Satan he's
55:20
already defeated the hosts of heaven
55:23
were very well defined and detailed made
55:27
by God to war against the army of
55:31
darkness to shred them try some fast
55:34
them pull down strongholds shred
55:36
platforms even ruling in high places on
55:41
when they didn't have anyone to fight
55:46
I've been to heaven before or Lucifer
55:48
fell it was a different time there was
55:53
no time but it was a different way I'll
55:55
say that it was a different way of life
55:58
all the army did was go on maneuvers
56:02
that's all they ever did
56:04
there was no evil there was no place to
56:08
war there was no one to war and yet God
56:11
who loves to confuse or surprise
56:15
whichever way you want to do it he's
56:17
strange and I know many people for ages
56:20
have said our God operates in strange
56:23
ways but you never really thought he was
56:27
actually strange himself
56:30
that's why his ways and his thoughts are
56:33
strange that's why we don't have them
56:36
because we try to think practical and
56:39
logically he's the most illogical being
56:42
out there because what he says doesn't
56:46
make sense we would never pick that way
56:49
and yeah we are strange for those who
56:55
know him are strange trust me and when
56:58
we stranger still isn't that good news
57:01
and we will look different yeah you'll
57:06
have color in your ear
57:08
even more so than the world will because
57:12
he doesn't want you to hide anymore he
57:14
wants you to stand out it's heaven
57:18
culture everybody say it's heaven
57:21
culture come on let it go we have to
57:27
make a show Oh family in back and the
57:39
ages ago more than I know I shouldn't
57:43
tell you that anybody you try we try to
57:46
figure out God in our own mind it's not
57:48
gonna work because he did appear
57:52
somewhere neater natee eternity came
57:55
from him he told me that personally
57:58
telling this doctor to figure out when I
58:00
was he said is easier to figure out
58:06
eternity came for me than try to figure
58:08
out when I was because he is that's why
58:14
his name is I am
58:17
he doesn't say I was and I will be he
58:20
says I am its existence
58:25
so back before Lucifer fell it was a
58:29
joyous time it happened there's like a
58:31
Renaissance Fair all the time the angels
58:35
celebrated they worship they celebrated
58:39
even Lucifer would shout for joy over
58:43
his assignment to create worship and
58:46
sounds for his God he loved his position
58:52
not for himself he loved God he loved
58:57
that he got to step inside God the
58:59
Father and lead worship from inside him
59:02
he was anointed he was anointed because
59:06
he was able to step inside him not
59:08
everyone could do that Michael and
59:11
Gabriel could when they had to but
59:14
Lucifer had the right to step in him he
59:17
actually had created a portal for
59:19
Lucifer to step inside of him
59:21
and he would open his beautiful wings
59:23
all encrusted with gems and his pipes
59:26
and his taverts would make the most
59:28
beautiful sound in heaven and he would
59:31
sing he's saying that's why he controls
59:34
the music industry that's why he wants
59:37
your voice that's why he's so after all
59:41
the people who have a gift to sing he
59:44
wants their voice because he had the
59:47
most anointed voice in all of heaven and
59:49
it was glorious for him he actually
59:52
created glory for God and then he
59:54
decided to steal it
59:55
he came short of the glory of God the
59:58
first one you ever did he'd step inside
60:01
God and he would cover over the heart of
60:04
God and all these beautiful sounds would
60:08
come from him and all the Angels
60:10
one-third of angels were worship angels
60:13
we were in the throne room he was their
60:15
leader
60:17
they're the only ones he got he got the
60:20
ones that were under him someone else
60:23
believed him when he said is going to
60:25
take over and he make these beautiful
60:27
sounds and his voice would go all over
60:30
heaven not just in the throne room and
60:32
when he did at the heart of God the
60:34
Angels would begin to sing and in the
60:37
heart the fire around the heart of God
60:39
would begin to burn up inside of him
60:41
receiving all of that worship that's
60:43
what happens when we worship Him he
60:46
consumes our praise our God is a
60:53
consuming fire that then all he had was
60:57
the praise of the angels
61:00
she has ours now we replace them we
61:04
replace all the Angels that were thrown
61:05
out that's why he loves you to worship
61:09
that's what he loves worship that's why
61:10
he inhabits the praises of what say yes
61:14
loud
61:18
before the prese the angels would
61:21
inhabit him things changed a lot of
61:25
things James and so he would have that
61:28
phrase when angel will come down some it
61:31
would pass right through Lucifer the
61:33
pastor and all the time he loved he
61:35
loved to feel the praise of the angels
61:37
for God and he would make beautiful
61:39
worship beautiful voice and he loved it
61:43
and he was inside him so he saw all of
61:46
us if you didn't know that your home was
61:52
in him before he sent you here he
61:54
carried us we were with him all the time
61:56
when he went to the end we were with him
61:58
when he came back to the beginning we
62:00
were with him we've been from the end of
62:02
the beginning and the beginning to the
62:03
end before he made desserts we were in
62:05
him we played in the River of Life we
62:09
jumped up and down on the stones of fire
62:11
it was pretty sparkly things we loved
62:14
them we jump off in the river and swim I
62:17
jump up another one Jim jumped in swim
62:20
inside him as a holy mountain and we
62:24
would all gather in there laugh and
62:26
laugh and play and then sometimes God
62:28
would take one of us up in his hand and
62:31
he would tell us funny stories say he is
62:35
our Father say it louder he is our
62:39
father we are his offspring
62:44
he is our true father no matter what
62:47
your earthly father was like she is your
62:50
father
62:52
sure earthly father may have helped to
62:55
bring new year but that father sent you
62:58
here so we were inside all the time you
63:02
could see life coming in that we would
63:04
ride out on the Rays of glory this was a
63:06
scene in the throne room we would
63:08
rejoice we would sing we would laugh we
63:11
couldn't go beyond the bands of that
63:13
rainbow we rode in and out on his glory
63:15
in him we lived we move we had our being
63:19
it says the Prophet supposed to vote
63:22
have spoken of these things did you know
63:24
that was another part of the scripture I
63:27
know for a long time what things this
63:30
because when they lived in God when they
63:33
moved in and out of him when they had
63:35
their very existence in him that's where
63:39
your life was before you came here
63:40
before he made this planet that's what
63:43
we existed he was our world we were one
63:46
people one world one people and we have
63:50
one God that's why Satan wants the
63:52
one-world government because he wants to
63:55
duplicate what God had with us he wants
63:58
one world one people all worshipping Him
64:02
and the only can can existence to the
64:05
mark that he creates everything he does
64:08
is a copycat
64:10
of what God had it won't happen if what
64:15
happened but it won't happen any other
64:16
way because he wants that because God so
64:19
has it with those who still live in him
64:21
there's still some left to come right
64:22
yes we don't know we don't know when the
64:25
last one won't be sent only he knows
64:28
that you just had a mystery given to you
64:35
so that's what life was like up there
64:37
was joyous
64:38
it was celebrating except the host never
64:43
stopped wondering why did he want us
64:45
they have gotten so good at what they do
64:50
because they've been practicing for ages
64:53
and I've seen those guys I've been to
64:57
Michael's headquarters and heaven it's
65:00
on the far end of heaven I didn't even
65:02
know there was a scripture that said
65:04
that but I know it's in Isaiah right
65:06
Rick Isaiah 13 I think where they went
65:12
to gather the hosts of having to fight
65:13
on behalf of it went to the far ends of
65:15
heaven to gather the hosts of heaven to
65:17
fight on behalf of Israel I do know the
65:20
scripture the father told me to be there
65:22
because I've been there I knew where it
65:24
was like here's heaven right a world
65:27
that's his house and down years
65:30
Michael's headquarters it's not a
65:32
tourist attraction those barracks were
65:36
like 200 250 feet high that doesn't mean
65:40
there aren't bigger ones that means the
65:42
ones who can fit in there they have a
65:43
place I've seen someone may have like
65:48
every pore there being they have skin
65:51
that looks like big pieces of glitter
65:53
about this big
65:55
this being appeared actually in the
65:57
phase house to me when I was spending
65:59
the weekend there with her and she was
66:02
sleeping and came into she's got really
66:04
high ceilings in this part of her home
66:06
and the Holy Spirit said I'm going to
66:08
show you one of the hosts so I was awake
66:11
at 4:00 in the morning
66:12
and this big piece of glitter came in
66:14
and floated around and I'm like because
66:17
I've seen some of them already at this
66:18
point and went wow it doesn't look
66:20
dangerous and he says just waiting and
66:23
thousands of them came in and was
66:25
filling this room and went whether
66:27
they're pretty
66:28
he said we use him to bushwhack the
66:33
enemy him that meant all those pieces
66:36
were about to make something
66:40
another shouted and all these pieces
66:43
came together and there was this being
66:46
he was about 30 feet high his arms were
66:49
like this big around he only had I saw
66:53
it and he didn't have a mouth because he
66:55
didn't meet one and he was beautiful to
66:58
look at until the next thing happened
67:00
then all of a sudden experts shouted
67:02
again and out of every piece the glitter
67:05
that made up his skin came a sphere this
67:08
long it was a spear like a needle spear
67:12
and then he began to spin in that room
67:17
and Holy Spirit said his name is
67:20
shredder and then he took me out in
67:27
heaven and he showed me he showed me the
67:30
camp of the enemy and here was the
67:32
demons all around they had little camp
67:34
that's where those words come from ok we
67:36
have cam so our military of camps right
67:38
they have bases they have headquarters
67:40
every one of those words came from
67:42
heaven because they have that so here
67:44
was this a demonic camp this demonic
67:46
army had a camp going on I was watching
67:49
from kind of afar and all of a sudden
67:51
this big piece of glitter started going
67:54
in the camp like it's just floating
67:55
around and these demons who are
67:58
absolutely clueless because remember
68:00
said they lost part of their brain when
68:02
they fell they all laid their weapons
68:06
down and run up to the center of this
68:08
camp to see this beautiful piece of
68:10
glitter just bouncing around like that
68:13
they're going oh look at that oh look at
68:15
that
68:15
and all the sudden there's about a
68:18
thousand more coming in behind them that
68:19
they don't see and all of a sudden in
68:23
front of them with no weapons
68:25
shredder go show and he spun around and
68:32
shredded like missing pieces everywhere
68:36
from these demons arse arms eyes were
68:40
coming off then this thing was shredding
68:41
them and they were screaming trying to
68:44
get away from him because they got
68:45
bushwhacked
68:47
[Applause]
68:52
and that's just one of them they have a
68:56
tribe of shredders angels are made in
69:01
tribes that's what he told me so all the
69:07
army tribes belong to or under Michael
69:11
the worker angels describes the
69:14
messengers the couriers the ones who
69:16
bring the body parts from the warehouse
69:18
they planned you empty in this age the
69:25
ones you make connections and contacts
69:27
for you all the time start using ma'am
69:32
did you know that we actually have a lot
69:34
of help given to us and all we ask for
69:37

69:39
be paid most of us right I got it I just
69:43

69:45

69:48
on this earth no matter what you were
69:50
told he was not bored by earth standards
69:53

70:58
that little dot of flesh no matter how
70:59
small
71:00
it is if it's this big when they are
71:03
either miscarried or aborted that is an
71:05
entire little baby body that knows the
71:09
Lord that loves the Lord that loves you
71:12
if you are their parents absolutely love
71:15
you but these angels are powerful and
71:19
there's many of them and they've been
71:20
waiting for ages for the time of God to
71:23
say okay this is the time and the Lord
71:26
of Hosts goes into the camp Michaels
71:29
headquarters is okay get ready guys
71:30
you've got to have more fun than you've
71:32
ever had in your lives and their battle
71:35
cry when they go to war is well because
71:44
they know they're going to win this is
71:50
what you called you right now
71:52
everybody's your believer that army was
71:55
created for you they are fierce
72:00
they don't look pretty they're not
72:03
pretty boys but I taught them how to
72:08
wink and they don't even have eyelids I
72:16
received my army three years ago and I
72:20
have not been attacked or sick ever
72:23
since I've not been attacked the more
72:28
you send them the more you multiplies
72:30
them I now have 200 million that go
72:33
everywhere with me and when I come into
72:37
the city they come before me they deal
72:40
with the enemy before I get there they
72:42
deal with enemy at every Airport and
72:44
every airplane every piece of land we go
72:47
over over the ocean we go over and then
72:48
the air one more than if they hold the
72:50
plane up it's up to you if you want one
72:55
[Applause]
72:57
it's heaven protocol you have to invite
73:01
Christ in your life before he'll come in
73:04
is that right you have to invite holy
73:06
spirit showing to all of you before
73:08
he'll do that is that right you have to
73:10
invite you haven't dar me to be one of
73:12
your weapons if you want one stand up I
73:25
have testimonies from people all over
73:28
this world how rapidly their life
73:31
changed as far and being as far as being
73:34
attacked by the enemy if you're playing
73:37
in the camp of the enemy they won't
73:40
listen to you I want I said where if
73:44
they what if they stick them on their
73:45
neighbor and they're not comfortable you
73:47
say that they're not here to attack
73:50
flesh unless it's absolutely necessary
73:53
do you remember when they fought for
73:55
Israel they actually did fight flats
73:59
right yeah go read the Bible I think one
74:02
angel I think you slayed like 85,000 is
74:04
that correct
74:05
how many 185 thousand one army one
74:11
member of the army of heaven they're
74:15
fierce this is not a game we're playing
74:21
right now this is something this is of
74:23
one of the serious parts of what you're
74:24
going to do because if you ask for an
74:27
army you can't let them sit there and do
74:28
nothing you literally will begin to see
74:33
shapes over your house in the sky if
74:35
they're fierce they're not the demons
74:39
okay I've seen a lot of Gabriel's I see
74:42
them all the time that they were here
74:43
collecting your worship they were
74:45
collecting our declarations the whole
74:47
time you were doing it they were here
74:49
carrying up back up the step stairway to
74:51
heaven right up here and they're pouring
74:53
them in the bowls before the altar they
74:55
became incensed and I think you were
74:58
singing about incentives weren't you all
75:00
the time you were singing it you were
75:02
creating it
75:03
these angels these courier angels have
75:06
these vials that go long they collect
75:07
they don't let one word one prayer drop
75:11
to the ground they go in these vials
75:12
they become like liquid gold it's poor
75:15
before the the sneeze both before the
75:19
also before the throne of God and you
75:21
smell the aroma of your incense it fills
75:26
the throne room that's why they came we
75:30
were filling the throne room with our
75:32
aroma of our praise so God inhabits the
75:35
praises of his people so what did you
75:37
expect he came so we're about to help
75:41
one whole part one-third of the angles
75:43
to get really happy is something you
75:51
walk in the more you send them on
75:53
assignments the moisture you can be
75:54
strategic okay you can be dangerous
75:57
you're going to be dangerous when you do
75:58
this you become dangerous really you do
76:02
because I've told you they've waited for
76:04
ages to loosen all of them into the
76:07
earth and I saw millions pouring in two
76:09
years a couple years ago and I went this
76:11
is before I knew about inviting the army
76:13
and went wow he is really filling the
76:15
source of these I wonder what's going to
76:16
go on I didn't know that I have an army
76:19
and so the father showed up in my
76:21
encounter room in my home and he said
76:25
I'm going to teach you how to command an
76:27
army and I just I look at him most of
76:30
the time because I can't say anything
76:33
I'm too undone it's not X going to be
76:34
familiar you're kidding if I'm going to
76:36
melt the floor my heart feel is going to
76:38
beat out of my chest and Here I am
76:40
looking at me he says you have to invite
76:42
them it's protocol
76:43
and you took me back through the word
76:45
you invited Christ you by the Holy
76:46
Spirit you have to invite them they are
76:48
one of your mighty weapons mighty to the
76:52
pulling down of strongholds in spiritual
76:56
battles because our weapons aren't what
76:59
they're not physical right they are
77:01
spiritual and they they say day our
77:05
mighty to the pulling down of
77:08
strongholds
77:10
okay that's what they want to do in
77:12
waiting a long time are you kidding this
77:14
state is ripe for them so this is what
77:22
you're doing when you do this you're
77:23
actually you're actually inviting a
77:25
portion of the army start with a hundred
77:27
a hundred of these fierce fierce warring
77:32
army from heaven you get a hundred in
77:34
the more you use them and multiplies so
77:36
the next level is a thousand ten
77:38
thousand a million ten million a hundred
77:41
million it just keeps multiplying and
77:45
they don't want to be bored and if you
77:48
come outside they're all staring at you
77:50
like that that means you haven't been
77:52
sending them anywhere because they're
77:55
not going back to heaven it's like our
78:00
military's not going back home right
78:01
when they're sitting here on an
78:02
assignment they stay with their sense
78:04
where they're assigned to they will
78:06
actually receive orders from
78:08
headquarters to be assigned to you it's
78:11
all done very official in heaven it's
78:13
written down that you said yes they are
78:16
waiting and they will be handing orders
78:18
you're assigned to so-and-so so-and-so
78:20
and so-and-so they will be giving you
78:22
commands and sending you an assignment
78:24
to pull down the strongholds of darkness
78:27
where do you send them anywhere their
78:30
spiritual evil anywhere where there's
78:33
evil people being controlled by the
78:34
demonic anywhere the demonic has a
78:37
strong all is manifesting acting up the
78:39
storing killing whatever it is we're
78:42
human trafficking is where drugs are
78:44
work gangs are it's just pretty much
78:46
around the world the next time that
78:51
person in North Korea raises up his head
78:53
and threatens us everybody's tender army
78:56
there
79:00
because agreement is powerful and I tell
79:04
you what every demon will probably run
79:06
scream it before they ever reach you
79:07
because they'll see them coming in the
79:09
sky like here's millions descending upon
79:12
them right and they have the right
79:14
because we took power over them like you
79:18
have to have the right level of
79:20
authority to do that and Christ gave it
79:22
to us so what you're going to get is you
79:25
and get this army they will whip over
79:27
your home in the sky they might walk
79:31
through every now and then they're
79:35
waiting on you to give orders because
79:38
every army needs orders they don't want
79:41
requests say they don't want requests
79:43
say I'm in God's army
79:45
I need orders myself till they need
79:50
orders don't let me forget Holy Spirit I
79:54
am going to become a commander you can
79:58
even make out a list ok this tomorrow
80:01
I'm going to send them here here here
80:02
here here here it takes seconds in
80:05
natural time I mean before you can end
80:09
it and you say go and 10 seconds they'll
80:12
be back and have done it if you know a
80:19
bill is being presented before ever get
80:22
to the place where they're voting on it
80:24
you take power over all the power the
80:26
enemy that's promoting and empowering
80:28
people to present that bill empowering
80:31
people to vote for that bill you can
80:34
send the host to pull down all the
80:35
strongholds as a demonic controlling the
80:37
old situation
80:39
you can send a host to your school where
80:42
your kid goes to to vote on any
80:44
strongholds of the enemy that are
80:46
providing or about to wreak violence in
80:48
that school
80:50
anyone who's teaching things that aren't
80:52
of God through all they're all
80:53
controlled by Satan okay
80:55
anywhere Satan is controlling that's
80:57
where you send them okay we're not
81:00
worrying against the people we're
81:01
boarding against the demons controlling
81:04
them like all of human trafficking can
81:06
be affected if people who minister in
81:09
the area understand they can send the
81:12
homes to hold on all the strong laws
81:14
before they get there to rescue the
81:15
people that's how it works is his
81:19
likeness
81:19
everybody say acceleration this is
81:24
acceleration the hosts make toast and
81:36
they really do that that's what they do
81:38
and I actually tell them to do that I
81:40
have a button I wear that says the hosts
81:42
make toast
81:44
they make burnt toast
81:47
[Music]
81:49
we'll learn that chair in a minute okay
81:52
well this is help we're gonna end this
81:53
is the most amazing way this end is
81:55
going to be the beginning of something
81:57
the end of this day will be the
81:58
beginning of you Rory
82:02
amen so don't send them against your
82:07
neighbor's dog their cat
82:09
they're there loud music however if
82:12
they're very to file people you can
82:14
totally send them against the demons
82:15
controlling those evil and they'll
82:18
either get saved change or move I've had
82:21
many people move from my neighborhood
82:23
when you move in you get my book you
82:29
know exactly why I am there if you ever
82:32
want prayer so this is this is what
82:39
they're do this is what they were
82:40
created for to stop the army of darkness
82:44
to shred them they can't no one can ever
82:46
stop existing okay now the demons can't
82:49
stop existing will never stop assisting
82:51
we are eternal we're all eternal okay
82:54
but they'll never be immortal there's a
82:58
difference in immortality journal okay
83:00
angels are eternal but they're not
83:02
immortal you will be immortal one day
83:05
you're already eternal you're not you're
83:08
not just going to stop you're not going
83:09
to die for a while and live again you
83:11
will never stop existing your body dies
83:14
maybe your spirit man does all of you
83:19
with your soul goes to heaven has huge
83:22
parties and celebrates enjoys all your
83:25
rewards because your Labor's are over
83:27
but it's still you and one day you get
83:31
your body back don't cry it'll look
83:33
really good you're going to superglue
83:37
that spirit man and you become one being
83:40
immortal forever never can die never get
83:43
sick never can send okay we will be
83:46
immortal it says mortality will take on
83:48
immortality in the word
83:50
that's your future okay so it's okay to
83:56
be a commander if you can be the Bride
83:59
of Christ if you can be a king and a
84:03
priest these are all strips of titles
84:04
correct it's all in the word you can be
84:08
a commander it's a spiritual title so
84:12
this is how we do it we invite heavens
84:14
honor and we make a choice we're going
84:15
to invite them so we're going to thank
84:17
them for coming and we're going to thank
84:19
God for sending them and then you're
84:21
going to send them on the first
84:22
assignment this is acceleration because
84:27
you will have 100 army members waiting
84:29
to hear your words because Christ lives
84:32
in you they happen under the word of the
84:34
Lord and he sent them like so this is
84:40
what you're going to do people go I
84:41
don't like that that's wrong they try to
84:43
they try to label everything out they
84:44
can I want you give that up and fly it
84:47
what you just do it okay there's still
84:51
people arguing that Jesus is the Son of
84:52
God are you going to get on that train
84:55
because they've had almost nothing to do
84:58
and now they are sent for me and you
85:01
okay so here we go we say father I
85:03
choose as an act to my will
85:08
to invite heavens army to be one of my
85:12
weapons because they are mighty to the
85:17
pulling down of strongholds I received
85:21
them in Jesus name who is the Lord of
85:25
Hosts amen okay
85:31
they're always Nelson so now we're going
85:37
to send him on their first assignment
85:39
and this is rocky how the Lord taught me
85:42
the Lord showed up when the army came in
85:44
the father was telling me what to do and
85:46
then the Lord shows up with his army it
85:48
was amazing a lot of them look like
85:50
lions by the way if you see lion faces
85:52
in the sky they're part of the army
85:55
called the Royal Guard they guard the
85:57
Royals the Kings the priests in the Lord
85:59
and they look like I've seen many Lions
86:02
before I ever knew and that but that's
86:04
who they are they're part of the Royal
86:05
Guard because many of them are creatures
86:07
if you saw about the creatures okay so
86:10
now we've invited Hammonds army
86:11
everybody's got your army now we're
86:12
going to send them somewhere we're going
86:13
to send them to your own home we're
86:17
going to start with you okay so the
86:20
first thing you say is father I take
86:23
power over all the power the enemy
86:27
that is attacking my home my finances my
86:33
family my health my destiny I can be in
86:40
the hosts of heaven to go to my home and
86:45
put on every stronghold straight every
86:48
platform there's a demonic are operating
86:52
in I commend them to try stamp fast down
86:58
and throw them in a dry place go now and
87:06
Jesus say go home make toast
87:13
[Applause]
87:20
[Music]
87:21
[Applause]
87:25
everything God does is simply we could
87:30
sit here all day long and try to argue
87:32
doctrines the theology you know man's
87:35
opinions or assumptions that you know
87:38
they're trying to figure everything out
87:39
their selves that they waste so much
87:41
time the reason away most of what God
87:43
wants to do for them this is not the
87:46
time to read your stuff away
87:47
this is John said yes to God because if
87:50
it's not him it will work you didn't do
87:53
anything that's going to hurt anything
87:54
okay however stepping into your
87:57
authority and ruling and reigning with
87:59
Christ which he has already given us to
88:01
do it will do powerful things on your
88:03
behalf
88:06
anytime you go anywhere everywhere ago
88:08
I'm taking my city I'm taking it every
88:11
store I go in every restaurant I go in I
88:14
send them in before me they will shred
88:17
every demonic being it is the most
88:19
wonderful time I ever have in those
88:20
places because they can't do anything
88:24
send them when you go on vacations when
88:27
you go on business trips when you go on
88:28
mission trips you take them with you
88:30
everywhere because they're going to go
88:33
with you anyway I see him outside the
88:36
plane when I'm on the plane I see them
88:38
driving on they follow me in my car I I
88:41
go in the store and come out for Walmart
88:43
and they're like like this looking at me
88:45
when I come up the store my staff won't
88:48
meet my simple money assessment with me
88:50
and I've been teaching this to them you
88:52
know how to do this I walked out of
88:54
Walmart and there was probably thousands
88:56
of them and you could see their eyes and
88:58
they're like looking up what does that I
89:02
want that's my army they make the best
89:05
toast
89:09
and so I may come back and do a spirit
89:13
round boot camp if you let me
89:15
[Applause]
89:20
and the holy spirit started having me I
89:24
don't ever do workshops but I have one
89:26
now called the host ID workshop and I
89:30
teach you how to identify them in the
89:32
sky and we do that inside first I show
89:35
you all kinds of images of just I
89:37
actually do know the weather I show you
89:39
cumulus cumulonimbus Nimbus Stratus
89:42
Cirrus I'll show you what real actual
89:44
clouds are then I show you the hosts
89:46
pressing themselves in the clouds then
89:49
you see the shape of one then you see
89:52
literal ones because I have pictures of
89:55
them and so you learn when there's like
89:58
six sets of eyes like that looking at
90:01
you from the clouds that's not a cloud
90:03
with a strange formation if you see
90:06
clouds that are shredded and twisted and
90:10
going up everywhere that is spiritual
90:12
activity because they fight in the sky
90:15
their camouflage is the clouds and
90:17
they'll press themself in that cloud and
90:20
people all over the world are seeing
90:23
them okay well now you have an army
90:26
you're responsible for that army you can
90:29
make a list of things you've been trying
90:30
to break through and get taken care of
90:32
send the host to every one of those
90:34
places whether it's a whether it's a
90:37
court deal with a support case whether
90:39
it's a business deal whether it's a
90:41
house you're trying to buy whether it's
90:43
something in your finances you're trying
90:45
to get straightened out I'm telling you
90:47
write a list okay write a list and
90:50
you'll be shocked to see how quickly
90:52
things begin to change they're sent here
90:56
to keep us in all of our ways is that
90:58
correct yes well we're about to let them
91:01
do that and they will you begin to see
91:04
them over your house you will see them
91:06
you'll come outside see strange figures
91:07
over your house if you come out every
91:09
day they're still there that's down you
91:12
drive your car summer I get out now is
91:13
the same one you saw over your house to
91:15
over the store that sound and so I made
91:18
a cure for them for last thing I'm going
91:20
to teach you the Holy Spirit said
91:22
they've never had anything like me
91:23
before okay
91:25
in the past that you know the priest
91:29
would cry out to God the people cry out
91:31
for God to help them in Israel they cry
91:33
out for God to help the priests were
91:35
going in there and cry out to God and he
91:37
would send in a host literally they came
91:39
and they fought the people they killed
91:41
the wicked people I'm not saying they
91:43
can't do it I'm there may be a time when
91:46
they do do it on this earth to preserve
91:49
people's lives that God needs to keep
91:50
here but what they're sitting here now
91:52
for is so that we can push back darkness
91:55
and we will create regions of light by
91:57
doing this I'm driving them out of my
91:58
city there's not one place I don't go
92:02
that I don't send them in there to deal
92:03
with them I Drive my to my neighborhood
92:05
first and so anyway this is your now is
92:09
your responsibility you are now a
92:12
commander of the host it's going to be a
92:15
normal way of life for the body of
92:18
Christ any believer you know if you want
92:22
to show them in the scripture you go to
92:24
Isaiah I think is Isaiah 13 I can't
92:26
always remember exactly but by the way
92:29
if you want to description about I said
92:30
go to Hebrews 8 and read about the
92:34
heaven is Hebrews 11 right nick is 11 h
92:38
is 11 and n go look in chapter 11 in
92:41
Hebrews and we'll talk about heaven
92:44
being a city in a country so if you ever
92:46
wondered yes they have massive cities
92:48
they have huge beautiful stuff in the
92:49
country up there and now the hosts of
92:51
heaven are down here a whole lot so
92:55
anyway they will set up camp over your
92:56
home and sometimes my army my army
93:00
hemisphere would bring the demons that
93:01
they had caught and bashed and they
93:04
bring him on this long chain over my
93:06
house and I see them when missing body
93:08
parts I mean it went forever one guy my
93:10
life is this a parade they were bringing
93:15
shabby debris over my house okay
93:18
that's what if you weren't here last
93:20
night the Holy Spirit calls the Satan's
93:23
army shabby debris
93:26
and I mean they had eyes missing they
93:28
had arms and they were terrified because
93:30
they had just been beat up by the army
93:32
general okay so we've already sent them
93:36
you are now responsible and always start
93:39
by saying I take power over all the
93:41
power of the enemy and then you say what
93:43
you want to take power over this bill
93:45
about to be passed and such assets this
93:47
is I command you host go pull down the
93:50
strongholds that is promoting that bill
93:52
empowering people to put that bail out
93:54
you have to know what to say okay I take
93:56
power over the enemy trying to operate
93:58
my kids elementary school influence the
94:01
children and evil ways or whatever is
94:03
going on there to stop any violence and
94:05
taking place a community go pull down
94:07
all the strongholds around them and for
94:09
the protection of God to be upon them
94:11
and I'm telling you they will do it
94:13
instantly they know when they shred
94:15
those platforms what that is is high
94:18
places that Satan is taken over
94:20
generations because evil people are in
94:22
certain regions and areas they literally
94:24
can build on the sins of the people a
94:27
platform and then they can see because
94:30
demons can't be everywhere all at the
94:32
same time you neither can Satan
94:33
okay they only know by what you say what
94:36
you agree to say they build high places
94:38
but you can command the hosts to shred
94:41
those platforms and it becomes like dust
94:45
and then those high demons fall down
94:47
they have no longer the ability to see
94:49
in that region
94:52
send them in the hospitals to pull down
94:57
strongholds of infirmity sickness
94:59
disease that's coming against you your
95:02
family people just do it for fun you
95:06
passed by a hospital make sure you send
95:08
them in there okay someone's in there
95:10
suffering from the enemy so there's all
95:13
kinds of things I'll probably eventually
95:15
put a post up on my website giving a
95:17
whole list of things you can send them
95:20
we're in a new day okay we're going to
95:24
stand up and rule every King has an army
95:29
is that correct and they don't give them
95:31
requests they give them orders so father
95:35
I thank you for allowing me to come here
95:37
and declare for you to declare not just
95:40
to your people but to our nation into
95:42
this world god I thank you for trusting
95:44
me with the souls of those you love may
95:49
the peace of God the joy of the Lord his
95:53
presence his life consume you may you
95:57
know his ways may you have his thoughts
96:00
when you walk in them may you receive
96:02
them may you speak them
96:05
may you bring life and hope and help the
96:08
people around this world when you burn
96:10
and shine like the stars in the heaven
96:13
then you'll be above and not beneath and
96:16
never tolerate the enemy in your life
96:19
again nor participate by saying you
96:22
don't have or you can't do because he
96:25
put his son in you amen receiver
96:30
I tell you why you're behind you sit out
96:40
I want to share one more thing I usually
96:43
do share this when I'm teaching people
96:46
about the host and that is everyone does
96:49
everyone here agree that as born-again
96:53
believers followers of Jesus Christ you
96:56
believe we are joint heirs is that
96:58
correct you do understand that means
97:00
what he had and what he has is ours that
97:04
correct what he did when he was on the
97:07
earth we can do and we can do great or
97:09
is that correct because it was a
97:11
scripture that says Jesus actually said
97:14
this in the word if I wanted to I could
97:18
call on the army of heaven to come and
97:20
fight on my behalf you need to go search
97:22
that scripture out because he said that
97:25
himself but he didn't do it you know why
97:28
he didn't do it because it's our job it
97:31
was one of the things he was saving for
97:33
us he used to send the hosts all the
97:35
time in the Old Testament to war I map
97:37
of Israel and he could have he was
97:40
talking about you know when he's going
97:41
to go to the cross he was saying if I
97:42
wanted to I could call them to come and
97:45
fight on my behalf but he couldn't do
97:47
that because we all know he had to go
97:48
correct and let me tell you they wanted
97:52
to fight every one of them wanted to
97:55
fight they would have wiped that place
97:56
out but he had already had many talks
97:59
with them in heaven cannot interfere
98:03
they wanted they still they still didn't
98:06
get it you know they didn't want the
98:08
word to have flesh and come and die for
98:10
us
98:10
but the host had to listen to him he
98:12
said okay I'm giving you order and you
98:14
were not going to interfere okay you are
98:16
not going to interfere so he never
98:17
called on them to do that but he said if
98:19
he said I can call them to come and
98:22
fight in my behalf then you are not
98:24
doing anything wrong by calling them to
98:27
come and fight on your behalf
98:28
amen very good very good

god bless you think there's a clock okay
01:06
I may not look at that clock right you
01:09
know right here I can look down to what
01:12
time is although time really is
01:14
irrelevant to me in heaven they have no
01:18
time isn't that amazing it's a whole new
01:21
way of life up there down here we have
01:24
to keep everything scheduled and on time
01:27
we have timeframes to me we have
01:28
meetings you know you have to be done by
01:30
some time that doesn't exist in heaven
01:32
no they don't care how long you go
01:34
because heaven is like forever right and
01:38
if you don't know in heaven if you're
01:41
going to have an event at your house and
01:42
everybody does that you want you know
01:44
how many people have never heard me
01:46
before let me see your hands anybody
01:47
here not know me
01:48
Wow have you never heard of me or heard
01:51
me let me see your hand you may have
01:53
seen me on youtube or something I love
01:56
them people go I just met you on YouTube
01:57
I said I didn't know it was a meeting
02:00
place but we love I love you I said we
02:06
love you too that would be Father Son
02:09
Holy Spirit in me
02:13
if you hear me say we or they that's
02:18
what I'm talking about somebody kept
02:19
saying who are they
02:20
Father Son and Holy Spirit who else is
02:23
there right I mean if you know them
02:26
you're going to talk about they I know
02:29
they're a Godhead and I even know what
02:30
the three-in-one is if you've never
02:32
heard me say that when God speaks it is
02:35
the simplest form of communication he
02:38
doesn't you know he doesn't get people
02:40
confused he doesn't stretch things out
02:42
he doesn't expound he just says what is
02:45
true and it is called they are the
02:48
three-in-one
02:49
that means three individual beings
02:51
father son who used to be the word he
02:56
was called word forever never never
02:58
until he became Jesus Christ maybe
03:00
didn't know that and John it explains it
03:03
the word became flesh and dwelt among us
03:07
right and it says it says that there
03:09
wasn't anything that was made he was God
03:11
he was with God and there wasn't
03:13
anything that was made that was not made
03:15
by him and so we're thinking well how
03:18
can he make it if God made it actually
03:21
that's sort of the same explanation
03:23
about the three-in-one they have the
03:25
ability to step inside of each other
03:28
remember when Christ said you and me was
03:31
talking to the Father you and me and me
03:33
and you Father I pray that one day
03:35
they'd be one even as we are one when
03:37
you go to heaven you step inside the
03:39
Father Jesus steps inside the Father
03:41
Holy Spirit steps inside the father and
03:43
you are one now isn't that simple that's
03:47
really how that's really how it happens
03:50
the father is on the throne he's not
03:52
super glued to the throne by the way
03:54
people think he stays there forever
03:56
never no he doesn't he gets up he goes
03:58
around heaven he spends time with people
04:01
he has a throne room outside and from
04:04
these amazing powerful mountains it
04:06
looked like there they go miles and
04:09
miles miles in hi where this would be an
04:11
anthill compared to mountains in heaven
04:13
by the way it really is I mean there's
04:16
angels 2,000 miles high in heaven I'm
04:18
just going to put her out there for you
04:20
you ever wondered how big it was you
04:23
can't limit the one you made every
04:25
this earth was made like a speck in his
04:28
hand all of the universe which he calls
04:32
the cosmos the cosmos was made was made
04:36
by him and his son what the word used to
04:39
do is he would step inside the father
04:41
the father would go where there was
04:43
nothing he spoke what he wanted the word
04:46
stepped out and made it that's why his
04:49
name was the word because whatever God
04:52
spoke he took it and made it and they
04:55
made Adams body together they made all
04:57
that you see all the unseen made the
04:59
seen realm there's so much you could
05:02
talk about I am going to talk about
05:04
America tonight I can't escape it it's
05:07
the number one thing right now that
05:09
heaven is talking about is America ok
05:13
God God didn't start something and then
05:15
decide to drop it no oh he's moving and
05:20
shaking everything in our country
05:22
it's time for exposing all that was
05:24
wrong and setting in place that which is
05:27
right and so just for those of you who
05:30
don't know me I was born again at age 4
05:33
I'm going to be 65 I kept saying I was
05:35
because I forget how old I am
05:37
and I'm getting younger because it says
05:41
he would restore our youth like the
05:43
Eagles right that wasn't just a
05:46
statement he made is something you run
05:49
after what you declared that we shall be
05:53
established unto you you shall eat the
05:56
fruit in your lips right your words are
05:59
so important in the in this atmosphere
06:02
in the world in your own life your words
06:06
are what you create with everything he
06:09
made He willed it he spoke and then it
06:12
was pretty much that's the way was to
06:15
operate our own life okay because if
06:18
were his children for his offspring and
06:21
he is our Father how much like him are
06:23
we supposed to be you're living in the
06:27
time when that will be openly seen in
06:29
this world people living on earth like
06:33
they do in heaven they call it heaven
06:35
culture
06:37
so don't try to change the culture just
06:40
start living having culture and then you
06:42
know you're different because your very
06:46
life will change when you begin to do
06:48
that God for the first time is letting
06:51
us live on earth as they live in heaven
06:54
and he calls that heaven closer I'll be
06:57
talking about that tonight and it's
07:00
powerful I have to live it I can't just
07:03
tell you about it I literally have to
07:05
live that way in my life and I do and I
07:08
have not been sick in over three years
07:11
I have not been attacked in over three
07:14
years at all because he said and I took
07:17
these words and I believe them that I
07:20
live by them they give you power over
07:22
all the part of the enemy and nothing by
07:25
any means shall harm you so if you sit
07:30
there saying that's not possible than
07:32
his word right he put it in his word he
07:36
meant that it's the way you live it's a
07:39
type of lifestyle you have guys not
07:41
given you some nice new news to hear
07:43
he's given you a whole new lifestyle to
07:46
live it's not something you try is
07:50
something you do so you're going to hear
07:54
about some new things tonight because
07:57
we've got so much revelation about
07:58
heaven that was one of the reasons why
08:00
he showed me so much of it I know how
08:02
they live I know how they communicate
08:04
with each other now they're transported
08:06
know how heaven operates I know what
08:08
God's plans are for this earth I saw
08:11
heaven before the earth was made I think
08:13
glimpses of the new earth I've been
08:14
anywhere everywhere in between because
08:16
he chose to take me say Amen I'm going
08:22
to ask you this actually I'm just going
08:24
to tell you this you may not know this
08:26
but everyone here has actually already
08:29
been from the end of the beginning and
08:30
the beginning to the end because you
08:33
were in him before you came here
08:37
you've always been in him so whatever he
08:40
went you were with him
08:42
- how about that you came from you went
08:44
to the Future came back in the future he
08:47
sent you here to this earth but before
08:49
he did that you have been everywhere
08:51
with him Wow is not a new way to look at
08:55
you yeah got me undone
09:00
I've actually travelled through time you
09:04
know when they go into warp speed you
09:07
know all those lights flying at you that
09:09
is exactly what it looks like it was
09:13
crazy
09:14
I've always wanted ever since Star Trek
09:16
especially I've wanted to be an
09:19
astronaut my goal in this physical realm
09:21
was to be an astronaut and I wanted to
09:24
go you know I want to go check out the
09:27
universe I wanted to go see the stars
09:30
the planets I was captivated by what my
09:33
God had made I want to be out there
09:35
where he was I wanted to be in there
09:37
with him even as a little girl I thought
09:40
that way I was strange then ha ha ha my
09:45
mom almost told me every day of my life
09:47
you're so strange I don't know what
09:50
God's going to do with you and my answer
09:54
was always anything he wants to
09:57
[Applause]
09:59
I had earthly father there was an
10:03
amazing dad he loved everybody including
10:07
his enemies really loved his enemies -
10:09
either they were embarrassed or they
10:11
became his friend you could not have a
10:14
fight with my father he just wouldn't do
10:16
it
10:17
he loved too much and he believed in God
10:20
and he lived it he was talking when the
10:23
most precious people I ever knew in my
10:25
life and he is now in heaven celebrating
10:28
on his massive ranch that I couldn't see
10:30
the end to taking care of all of our
10:33
pets I know every time we said when I
10:39
hear him go egads you sent another one
10:45
did you know nothing was impossible -
10:48
God did you know he loves his creation
10:51
and he loves his creatures and heaven
10:55
animals aren't called animals down here
10:58
we call them that and having them called
11:00
creatures because every creature speaks
11:03
in heaven every creature in heaven
11:06
worships God they all have the ability
11:09
to talk your pets will never shut up
11:13
if you had a dog that drove you crazy
11:16
and on your neighbors you better send
11:18
them on it you know send them on a tour
11:19
to go share something with people in
11:21
heaven because they're not ever going to
11:23
shut up and they get a hold of you you
11:25
want your bark bark bark you hear did
11:27
you know this happened and I saw this
11:28
and this was there and I remember when
11:30
you did this to me it took me here and I
11:32
got to do that and all the Christmases
11:34
already to get a chew on the presents
11:35
and rip the paper off the present that's
11:40
what you got to look forward to out
11:41
there your cats climbing up from the
11:44
Christmas tree trying to get them down
11:47
meeting on a little your furniture they
11:51
will not be doing that in your mansion
11:55
when you really think about life you
11:57
know through God's eyes it's amazing he
12:01
looks at everybody here like you're
12:03
totally complete you know if you belong
12:05
to his son you're precious
12:07
actually everyone is precious he loves
12:09
all humanity everyone came from him
12:12
there was not one person that came from
12:14
some other planet there not an alien
12:16
they weren't birthed by Satan although
12:17
sometimes you think they were he didn't
12:24
create anything except sin Satan owns
12:28
nothing he's not even supposed to be in
12:32
the second heaven one day he's going to
12:36
be kicked out of there maybe you've
12:40
never considered that by God to show me
12:42
so much of the future I know how
12:45
powerful we are because of Christ and
12:47
how small and insignificant the enemy is
12:50
our doormat we are not a doormat
12:53
you are never created to be a doormat
12:56
know what people say that turning the
12:58
other cheek does not mean you're going
12:59
to let someone beat you to a pulp
13:00
because the Jesus Christ
13:02
that means you choose to ignore all
13:05
awful things that they've said about you
13:07
all the excavations all the blast all
13:09
the blasting and they've done you you
13:11
turn the other cheek because you choose
13:13
not to respond back and do what the
13:15
enemy wants you to do okay but you're
13:18
not a doormat you considered royalty in
13:20
heaven
13:21
if you are okay if we are kings and
13:26
priests and to our god what is that that
13:29
is a spiritual title of authority in
13:34
this earth it's an eternal title of
13:37
authority so how much authority you have
13:40
as much as you're willing to take for
13:42
Jesus Christ we have been given so much
13:48
this is just my introduction okay I'm
13:50
just trying to get because there's new
13:53
people and even I want to just you know
13:55
blow your box apart
13:56
I tell you Jesus Christ never put anyone
14:02
in a box he was out of the box in his
14:05
day he was funny he was funny he was
14:09
extremely rich when you satin ate with
14:12
sinners those were business
14:13
acquaintances he had he was extremely
14:17
wealthy okay uh the only thing that
14:19
draws wealth is wealth he has some of
14:22
the wealthiest loans okay even Lazarus
14:25
was extremely wealthy he had some
14:27
Christian wealthy friends but he had
14:28
some that weren't and he was he was the
14:30
most captivating person they knew and if
14:33
all he did was beat them up with sin
14:35
they would never satin ate with him but
14:38
I promise you he shared the truth he
14:41
captivated them with revelation with
14:43
understanding probably of outer space
14:45
and other things that was never known on
14:47
years before he is the spirit of
14:50
prophecy that right I promise you use
14:52
prophesying all the time to those people
14:54
he read their books all the time while I
14:56
ate with him he told some of the
14:59
greatest jokes of all time I know he was
15:03
it was like Jesus in his Merry Men
15:05
that's what it was like I had seven
15:08
brothers I they did when they got
15:10
together okay it wasn't any difference
15:13
they didn't follow Jesus necessarily
15:15
because he was the lord of glory he was
15:16
a lot of fun
15:17
he always supplied in paid for all their
15:20
upkeep wherever they traveled he took
15:22
care of all their whatever they say
15:23
whatever they ate you know he paid for
15:26
that you don't have a treasure to hold
15:27
your nickels
15:30
he had a treasure that traveled with him
15:33
he wasn't poor that's just man's
15:36
tradition that told you that you're not
15:39
supposed to be poor I know that the word
15:43
says and I'm going to explain this is a
15:45
revelation he gave me that that he
15:48
became poor that we might be okay what
15:52
is rich is that poor is that poverty
15:56
level is SOC humble or there's that
15:59
humility of holiness no he said be holy
16:02
as I am holy that's the condition of you
16:05
inside
16:06
there's nothing doing how much money you
16:07
don't have okay the enemy is not
16:11
supposed to have all the money
16:13
he's not we're supposed to be some of
16:15
the wealthiest people in this world
16:17
someone who should have the most wisdom
16:20
the most fun the most money be the most
16:23
radical people in asserts because we
16:26
belong to him and I know what man's
16:30
mindset has always told us because I was
16:32
raised in wonderful denominational
16:35
churches and Christ isn't abandoning the
16:38
church he is married to the church guess
16:42
who the churches it's us it is the body
16:45
of Christ okay
16:47
we're married to him how much does he
16:49
love you if he's married to you he cares
16:53
about everything in your life but you
16:54
need truth in Revelation so that will
16:57
dispel all the things the myths and the
17:00
lies and the bondage that the enemy has
17:04
taught man to put us in and if you don't
17:08
have revelation and this time revelation
17:10
comes from God it doesn't come from man
17:12
when you hear something you've never
17:14
heard before that came from God like
17:17
explaining how what the three-in-one is
17:20
how simply caught me up I think up to
17:22
heaven thousands of times I lost count I
17:24
stopped counting okay I don't count
17:27
anymore it doesn't even matter even this
17:30
morning he showed me things in heaven I
17:33
get up for the first two hours he's
17:35
pretty much kills me with revelation I
17:37
don't want to leave the room because I
17:39
want more
17:41
and I start my day by talking to him I
17:45
start my day when my eyes open father I
17:48
ask for and receive grace for this day
17:50
for abundant life and they filming fuel
17:53
from heaven did you know you can get
17:56
that every day yourself jewel from
17:58
heaven for every day of your life that's
18:01
why Christ could walk through this earth
18:03
the way he did did you know that the
18:06
word says that the father filled his son
18:09
with His grace while he was a child you
18:13
will find it you look it up well what
18:16
does good grace does God have I'm not
18:18
mother father the father has grace he
18:21
actually has a throne of that's his
18:25
throne and he says come before my throne
18:27
of grace is that right to find grace for
18:32
help in time of need is that what the
18:34
word says that means to come and get it
18:37
for every day of your life what is that
18:39
grace its grace for abundant life Christ
18:44
gives us grace for eternal life say
18:48
correct yes but there's more and you can
18:52
live the abundant life by asking for
18:55
that grace I know I've been doing it for
18:58
like eight years it changed me it
19:01
changed me the first day I did it
19:03
because I didn't come out of that room
19:05
filled full of me I came up filled full
19:09
of heaven it's almost like it's laying
19:12
just like you're walking in a dream but
19:14
it's real because nothing can penetrate
19:17
or touch you like before things used to
19:20
pierce you right they pierce you they
19:22
wound you you get upset or you get
19:25
offended
19:25
even though you didn't want to you get
19:28
angry really angry about things so
19:30
frustrated in confusion none of that can
19:33
penetrate you that's why you didn't
19:36
penetrate Christ okay God didn't even
19:40
give him a choice he is as I filled my
19:43
son with my grace as a child I feel my
19:46
son with my grace that was great for
19:49
abundant life that's why Christ said I
19:52
come to bring life and bring
19:54
yet more abundantly it's really all in
19:59
the word and I received so much
20:02
revelation on the word it also changed
20:05
me
20:05
that's not man's interpretation it's not
20:09
man's mindset or assumption of what they
20:11
think it means it's from the Father amen
20:16
Jesus introduced me to the Father
20:18
he's the only way back to the Father he
20:20
is a door to the Father and the reason
20:24
why he was willing to die was because he
20:26
knew he would open that door for us to
20:28
receive him and it would bring us back
20:30
to heaven where we came from this the
20:35
gospel is very simple okay
20:37
we had to have a way to come back to him
20:40
we had to have something that was holy
20:42
enough to be sacrificed they would wipe
20:44
away all the sins because Christ doesn't
20:48
keep you out of heaven he's the only way
20:51
to heaven
20:52
his blood doesn't keep you out of heaven
20:55
it keeps wickedness evil in sin out of
20:57
heaven so the only way you get rid of
21:00
that stuff is by receiving him say Amen
21:03
because the father has absolutely
21:06
informed me face-to-face
21:09
it says the pure in heart shall say that
21:13
really loud don't let people say you
21:16
cannot see the face of God Christ is
21:19
what changed it on Christ when you
21:23
receive him and his sacrifice it wipes
21:26
everything out literally in the spirit
21:28
realm when you receive guys you get a
21:30
shower of the blood of Christ on the
21:32
inside that wipes everything off every
21:36
sin from as far back as you ever did it
21:39
it removes it from you like you never
21:41
did it it makes you righteous okay that
21:47
means you have you're standing upright
21:49
before God you have right standing
21:51
before God because of Christ that is
21:54
what Glaus you into heaven okay because
21:57
you're not going in there carrying all
21:59
your sins witness and evil and the
22:01
father has in ant face-to-face to me sad
22:04
I will not allow the entire earth
22:07
come to heaven the way they are because
22:09
if either all earths come to heaven
22:11
without my son heaven would be just like
22:14
this earth and say we don't want it like
22:19
that why living here and go through all
22:23
this mess right why go through all this
22:27
stuff that's in people in wicked people
22:29
evil everyone live like that and go to
22:32
having to live the same way say he
22:35
kicked it out and it's not coming back
22:38
in so people who tell you a loving God
22:43
wouldn't send people to hell he doesn't
22:47
he actually makes away so you can come
22:50
back to him he wants you to come to
22:52
heaven but there's only one way there
22:54
and that's still his son Jesus Christ
22:58
I'm just preaching preaching right now I
23:02
was I was raised on this stop I was
23:05
raised we live by faith we lived that
23:11
way growing up I'm one of 15 that alone
23:14
was not easy that will kill you right
23:17
there people say you're going to have a
23:20
school if I have the school it would be
23:22
the school of dying the school of dying
23:26
to your flesh is what we all need amen
23:29
I had to die to my flesh to do this I I
23:33
couldn't be continually being taken up
23:35
to heaven before the father showing me
23:37
the future showing me the past showing
23:39
his the very way he's made and created
23:42
on the inside on the outside revealing
23:44
the Word of God to me and he didn't do
23:46
any of that just so I would sound good
23:49
he did it to change you he wants you to
23:54
know who he is so you'll know who you
23:56
are
23:56
amen because the more we know them the
23:59
more you know you let us make man in our
24:02
image and after the way we operate did
24:05
you know that's what the word likeness
24:06
meant people think he's saying the same
24:09
thing in Genesis 1:26 there's a
24:11
scripture for you what does it make man
24:13
in our image and after our likeness
24:16
there's the word our again father-son
24:20
hold
24:21
spirit let us make them look like us and
24:25
let us help them operate like us so
24:29
that's where I get all the authority the
24:31
Dominion having revelation understanding
24:34
what life is in heaven you know that's
24:36
what that means that's what that means I
24:38
can operate like them because I know how
24:41
they operate right and so this is what
24:44
we need to hear up here behind a pulpit
24:48
to be a holy place that brings life hope
24:51
a future in freedom ok that's what it
24:55
was made for it was never meant to
24:57
spread deception deception is the
25:01
opposite of truth
25:03
deception puts you in bondage it does
25:05
not make you free although many people
25:07
say you can freely sin I don't know
25:10
anywhere in the entire Bible that he
25:13
ever said you can freely send you well
25:17
they're preaching that if you've never
25:20
heard it I promise you I were preaching
25:22
it sometimes in Christian colleges check
25:27
out the professors who are teaching your
25:28
children it's reading one of the worse I
25:33
call it a plague when the worst plague
25:35
done on the earth today is deception and
25:37
many people are being pulled on because
25:40
it just sounds right it sounds kind you
25:44
know the grace covers everything and so
25:47
freely sin because the grace will cover
25:50
it
25:51
but that's what they're saying they're
25:54
saying you don't have to repent and I
25:56
know the scriptures and he's talking to
26:00
believers when he said this
26:01
if you confess your sins that he was
26:06
righteous and just to forgive you of
26:08
your sins and cleanse you from all
26:10
unrighteousness because unrighteousness
26:13
is not right standing with God you see
26:16
that sin means you don't have right
26:19
standing with God if you repent what did
26:22
you just say I will forgive you of your
26:24
sins and cleanse you from all of that so
26:27
you again have a right standing and you
26:29
are righteous sin
26:31
and never helped anybody except the
26:33
devil and did you actually know that you
26:37
can live sin free I live sin free I do
26:44
not sin I don't send it all not about
26:48
anything anytime anywhere I don't send
26:50
and I'm a human I'm a female human who
26:55
lives in free on this earth and it's
27:00
more fun than sinning that doesn't mean
27:07
I'm going to beat you up about your
27:08
issues or your mistakes okay I used to
27:11
have issues and mistakes myself but
27:13
there was a point in my life where I
27:14
decided I'm not I'm tired of it it's not
27:18
worth it it's helping the devil it's
27:21
giving him ammunition you're going to
27:24
beat you up later with it I mean really
27:27
beat you up because it gets in your soul
27:30
and he reminds you all the time I know
27:33
people I know people they're finally
27:36
free after years and years of years of
27:38
being stuck in that snare of the enemy
27:40
then he put you then he wants you there
27:43
okay and eventually he's going to drag
27:45
you to hell and torture you
27:46
he doesn't love anybody not even his own
27:49
demons he despises them he rules them
27:51
with fear don't let fear in your life
27:55
God never told us to fear and actually
27:58
he said fear not take no thought for
28:01
what your life I think it pretty much
28:04
covers everything people go people said
28:10
how could you stand there and say that
28:14
the way you said it like like like what
28:16
it was real because it was real I mean I
28:21
knew I absolutely knew that he had
28:24
chosen Trump for the presidency I even
28:27
knew his reasons he didn't have to tell
28:29
me but he did because he was the right
28:32
person in case you didn't know he likes
28:35
business people
28:37
I was a business person I was not a
28:42
pastor of an in the Fievel ministry I
28:44
was a business person he pulled me out
28:46
of my knifes office job and stuck me
28:48
here with pink hair that was before that
28:55
was before even it was heaven culture I
28:56
didn't know that was normal in heaven
28:59
but it is everybody has color in their
29:02
hair in heaven some of them have diamond
29:05
dust some of them have living stuff put
29:09
in their hair it's alive now does that
29:12
sound like heaven yeah you shout glory
29:16
to God you create a rainbow bridge and
29:17
you cross over the crystal sea now that
29:22
doesn't sound like this world does it
29:25
when anyone talks about heaven you
29:27
better hear stuff you never heard of
29:29
before unless you've been there it
29:33
should be something that captivates your
29:34
mind that you never even consider
29:37
because that's what the word says I have
29:39
not seen nor ear heard nor entered in
29:42
the heart or mind of man see I do know
29:45
the word except unless the Spirit of God
29:49
reveals it to you that's the rest of the
29:52
scripture some people say part of a
29:54
scripture am i making that sound is that
29:57
me I know I know what the word says and
30:06
in heaven was one of the greatest
30:08
mysteries probably the last greatest
30:10
mystery of all time what does it look
30:13
like everybody knows we worship as as a
30:15
worship you knew you got two pieces of
30:17
clothing a gallon of salvation and a
30:20
robe of righteousness right yes
30:22
it didn't say you're going to get wings
30:23
in heart by the way you don't want wings
30:28
what would you do with a 12 foot high
30:31
pair of wings on the back of your foot
30:34
the back of your person you would sit on
30:37
shut them in the door whack people when
30:39
you move to the right or the left who's
30:41
not people over
30:44
you were never created to be an angel
30:47
we actually are over the Angels it says
30:52
that we will judge angels right yes so
30:56
don't think that you're lower than the
30:57
Angels I know there's a scripture that
31:00
actually says God made you a little
31:01
lower than the Angels but you know in
31:04
the Greek and Hebrew you know with that
31:05
word actually means I made you a little
31:07
bit lower than them we were made a
31:10
little bit lower than down right I don't
31:13
know if you knew that but that's what
31:14
that says
31:15
I guess I think that DM and I remember
31:18
who was at the the English that
31:20
translated the Bible right the King
31:22
James Version taking Holy Spirit the
31:25
King James Version I think maybe they
31:27
thought that was just too wild that we
31:30
were a little lower than God but he said
31:32
no not the year gods and that's a little
31:34
G did you know that's in the word we all
31:38
do but nobody wants to go there because
31:40
you don't know what it means it means he
31:42
is our Father we are made in their image
31:45
to operate like them we will never be
31:47
God say Amen he's not going to give you
31:51
a plant with a bunch of people okay you
31:53
have to win and then help get there and
31:56
go so that you're not going to repeat
31:57
that all right but he will give you a
32:00
planet one day to create fun places on
32:02
it you're staring at me does that sound
32:08
like God I'm not talking about a human
32:11
who made the planets is there anything
32:15
on them no say no there's no
32:20
civilizations on the planets they're a
32:22
blank canvas
32:25
[Music]
32:28
if our father is a Great Creator right
32:32
and his son the word created with him
32:35
that's how they operate okay that's why
32:39
we have inventions where do you think
32:40
they come from
32:41
it says every witty idea comes somewhere
32:45
yeah they come from having people invent
32:48
creat all over heaven all the time even
32:50
more than you do here his ultimate goal
32:53
for us is to do that you don't have to
32:56
take vacations somewhere on heaven now
32:58
number one you're not going to really
32:59
work you're going to use your gift
33:01
where's your gift not your job you have
33:03
now say Amen you will not have a 8 to 5
33:11
or 9 to 5 job when you take a little
33:13
card and stick it in the time clock
33:14
which by the way I used to do that a
33:16
long time ago you're not going to have
33:19
some supervisor breathing over your neck
33:20
because you didn't do something right
33:22
you can't be fired he's not going to
33:29
take away your retirement point that is
33:33
your retirement plan living there ok all
33:39
of your family member and friends are
33:41
having the best time of their life
33:45
they're not suffering they're not sick
33:47
not all they're not handicapped or not
33:51
in fear amen they don't experience any
33:54
of that in heaven they exist to live
33:59
their body might be dead the day you
34:03
know what it says the dead in Christ to
34:05
rise that is your body say that's my
34:09
body it's still a part of me that part
34:14
sleeps well we have an awesome time in
34:17
heaven
34:20
it clearly says that and let me tell you
34:24
I always tell people if you choose to
34:27
die and go to heaven you will not miss
34:30
the rapture when it happens you actually
34:33
know about the rapture before any human
34:36
being on earth knows about it because
34:38
you will be coming with them is that
34:40
right it says that you get your bodies
34:44
back first it will be instantly
34:47
glorified forever and you will then be
34:50
immortal not mortals and then those who
34:54
are alive and remain in my correct my
34:56
being correct those who are alive and
34:59
remain will be caught up and changed in
35:02
an instant right in your own body
35:05
you'll be changed instantly you will be
35:07
glorified you will become immortal
35:09
because as immortality must take on
35:12
immortality there you go there's there's
35:16
a sermon from the Bible however when you
35:19
got revelation on that it gets a lot
35:20
more exciting okay revelation you're
35:24
supposed to live like they do up there
35:26
right now on earth you know source of
35:28
waste you get to heaven okay
35:30
you know suppose the way to get to
35:31
heaven no because we have been calling
35:34
this in for probably ages or generations
35:36
at least when Christ said pray this way
35:39
right our Father now who are we talking
35:43
about one I'm not going to make some
35:44
clarification here when he said our
35:46
Father he meant the Father in heaven
35:49
right our Father who is in heaven holy
35:53
is your name
35:54
that's what how old means okay holy is
35:58
your name whose kingdom is coming say
36:03
that's heaven that he's talking about
36:06
say the kingdom of heaven is what Jesus
36:09
was talking about
36:11
so we're basically telling the father
36:13
your kingdom of heaven come to earth and
36:16
then what is that going to look like
36:17
your will on earth as it is
36:24
in heaven that is called heaven culture
36:27
that is a way of life okay so I'm not
36:31
making this up it's in the word it's on
36:35
the word that meant there had to be a
36:37
time before the millennial reign I'm
36:41
talking about before the end comes there
36:45
had to be a time when heaven would be
36:47
seen operating innocent through us on
36:49
this earth living on earth like they do
36:51
in heaven because we asked for it we
36:54
declared it decreed it god had already
36:56
planned it this is before the Millennial
36:58
age because Christ won't need our help
37:02
say Amen
37:05
but the word also says that there will
37:08
be a generation a group of type of
37:10
people on this earth that will taste of
37:14
the powers of the age to come well the
37:18
next age after this kingdom age is the
37:21
Millennial age that means we are that
37:24
group and type of people that will taste
37:26
to the powers of the Millennial age
37:28
where people will live to be seven and
37:30
eight and nine hundred years old that's
37:34
that's one of the manifestations of
37:37
heaven being on this earth and there you
37:40
go I mean that really doesn't even I
37:42
mean you don't even mention having in
37:43
that part but it does say there'll be a
37:45
group and type that we're generation
37:47
means in the word it can mean three
37:49
things just because I'm going to clarify
37:51
some more stuff for you hum a little
37:53
people okay the word generation can mean
37:57
a time span most of the time it doesn't
38:00
by the way two other meanings are a
38:03
group and type of people and it means an
38:06
age you can go look it up okay this
38:10
generation shall not pass away until all
38:13
these things be fulfilled including the
38:16
coming of the son of man
38:16
that word generation means a group and
38:19
type of people and everybody thought it
38:22
meant those who are alive when Israel
38:24
became a nation and that generation that
38:27
was here when Israel became a nation in
38:28
1948 that they would not pass away until
38:32
the coming of the Son of Man it happened
38:33
so that age grew
38:35
which I obey now all right that was
38:39
almost 60 years ago am I correct yeah
38:42
well if people were 60 and 70 then where
38:44
are they right now if they belong to
38:46
Christ they're in heaven right now
38:48
that word in that scripture did not mean
38:51
a time span it meant a group and type of
38:55
people that means it could be whenever
38:59
God chose her to be on the earth
39:01
that a group of type of people would
39:03
live like they would in the Millennial
39:06
days when sickness would be almost
39:08
non-existent
39:09
that they would live to be hundreds and
39:11
hundreds of years old because it also
39:13
says about the Millennial age that if
39:15
someone died at a hundred would be like
39:17
a child dying because back in the
39:21
ancient times you all should know this
39:23
yourself people live to be six and seven
39:26
hundred years old is that correct yeah
39:29
that was the fourth flood that was
39:31
before all that stuff happened that's
39:32
how old people live and I'm thinking man
39:34
how easy was that mean they weren't live
39:36
in heaven culture right
39:38
but God sustained them and what about
39:41
Sarah all the women say I am NOT Sarah I
39:46
don't want to be Sarah she was a hunter
39:51
when she had a baby but let me tell you
39:55
she looked amazing
39:59
she looked really good for being that
40:02
old because God had purpose to give
40:04
Abraham his promise right and you know
40:07
why he needed that promise so the Jewish
40:09
race would exist on the earth so he
40:12
always had a plan of why he did things
40:14
he has a plan while you're sitting here
40:16
right now because he wants you to live
40:18
on earth like they do in heaven it is my
40:21
number one thing that he has me teach
40:23
about besides America okay living on
40:27
earth like they do in heaven well heaven
40:29
is amazing there's no way to even look
40:32
at this right now and you actually had a
40:34
glimpse of heaven you think I don't know
40:35
how that is possible well because of God
40:37
and his timeline it is very much
40:40
possible amen
40:42
this is the thing you have to do you
40:44
have to choose to live it your will is
40:47
the most important thing in you you
40:49
will is the heart of your being when God
40:52
said heart he meant your soul amen
40:57
your soul you're not just a human being
41:00
you are a living did you know that he
41:04
said Adam was a living that means you
41:07
are - that's how important your soul is
41:10
well I know what human soul looks like I
41:12
know how it operates I know how to make
41:14
it prosper why did he show me that so
41:18
you could do it it's the most important
41:21
thing you probably ever learn because
41:22
you'll change your whole entire life
41:24
you'll change how you live you change
41:26
your physical condition your mental
41:27
condition the way you operate the way
41:29
you act the way you respond to people
41:31
what you think about and what you choose
41:33
will change so yeah I've seen a living
41:36
soul it's it's beautifully made and I
41:40
know growing up in the past in mind
41:42
denomination we always told the soulless
41:45
realm was bad how many people say Amen
41:48
you knew that maybe you didn't know back
41:50
in the day when they talked about the
41:53
soul it was never good and yet we would
41:56
all say oh my soul and others within me
41:59
bless your Holy Name right
42:02
and yet they would turn on say the soul
42:03
is not good I'm like I'm like eight and
42:06
I'm like are they thinking about what
42:09
they're saying because what they told me
42:11
a few minutes ago does not line up with
42:13
the fact that my soul's rejoicing and
42:15
blessing God so if all that is within me
42:18
is if my soul was bad and all that is
42:21
within my soul is bad how can I bless
42:23
him did they know what they're talking
42:25
about obviously didn't know what they
42:28
were talking haha it's true isn't it
42:32
this is how revelation changes you when
42:35
he shows you in reveals in the word this
42:38
is what I meant when I said this but
42:41
there's a way to make your soul prosper
42:43
and he even says in the word it says in
42:46
the word if you want to prosper and be
42:47
in health what does it say so if if your
42:52
soul people used to say ignore the soul
42:55
just focus on the spirit and I have to
42:56
be your spirit man is very important
42:58
right you have that spirit before you
43:00
have this body we're a little being
43:02
your spirit was made out of light it
43:04
still is made out of light but in heaven
43:07
which is a spiritual world in a
43:09
spiritual realm you have a literal life
43:12
I mean you touch things you have a real
43:15
mansion you live in that spiritual body
43:17
operates in the spirit realm sort of
43:20
like your physical body does in this
43:21
earth say Amen I'm not going to tell you
43:26
something that's not true I would be in
43:28
trouble with my father and I'm not going
43:30
to do that heaven is a spiritual realm
43:34
okay your spiritual body came from there
43:38
it says in the word our citizenship is
43:40
in you know where you came from is where
43:44
your citizenship is that right my
43:46
citizenship here is in America I was
43:48
born an American I am an American god
43:50
bless america
43:51
god bless the red white and blue you
43:54
know I was born in America so my
43:56
citizenship is there wherever you're
43:58
born in the world that's where your
44:01
citizenship is some countries let you
44:03
have a dual citizenship like England
44:05
will let you have one there and have on
44:06
you I think Canada probably will I'm not
44:08
sure but I know there are some countries
44:10
that let you have two citizenships
44:12
well our original citizenship is from
44:16
the place we came from it's heaven or he
44:19
wouldn't have told you your citizenship
44:21
was there well that's how that's this is
44:26
how detailed the father is being right
44:28
now with me it's detailed revelation
44:31
because you have to see yourself that
44:33
you came from there you didn't live on a
44:36
planet you didn't have a home in heaven
44:38
at that time God was your home the
44:42
father he said I am your father
44:44
you are my offspring I carried you like
44:50
in a womb of a mother and he actually
44:52
said we played in the River of Life so
44:54
when he made the womb of a woman he put
44:56
water in it so it would be normal to us
45:01
that makes sense
45:04
when he sent you from themselves he made
45:06
that womb sort of like when we lived in
45:08
him we played in the River of Life so we
45:11
were in water all the time
45:14
in that awesome
45:18
you ran inside of the father and played
45:21
on the stones of fire that shoot the
45:23
rainbow outside of him you played in the
45:26
rainbow you played in the rainbow don't
45:31
we all go oh look at that rainbow
45:33
because something deep inside of you
45:36
gets reconnected with him when you see
45:40
those colors it's here sign say that's
45:43
God's sign and that's his promise the
45:48
image belongs to him and he recently
45:52
told me whoever wears that image or fly
45:55
that image is calling me to them
45:59
[Applause]
46:04
somebody get Marge Gardner
46:07
[Applause]
46:10
there's a whole group of people marking
46:13
themselves for salvation
46:17
[Music]
46:19
it will never be anyone else's image it
46:25
says there's a rainbow round about the
46:28
throne it comes from him net awesome I
46:35
love rainbows what about double rainbows
46:38
and triple rainbows
46:39
around rainbows I've actually seen round
46:42
rainbows I've actually seen God draw a
46:44
round burnt rainbow in the sky with his
46:46
finger I was in a foreign country and I
46:51
saw him do that she told me my father to
46:54
fast and pray for three days and meet
46:56
him on this mountain and he drew a round
46:59
rainbow right where right above where we
47:01
were took about two hours it was
47:02
glorious sing and for the first time I
47:04
saw heaven coming down to that rainbow
47:07
I saw a living stairway come it looked
47:10
like glory mist and I saw angels walking
47:13
up and down in that and coming down to
47:16
that rainbow he actually drew a portal
47:19
in the shape of a rainbow and awesome
47:26
[Laughter]
47:28
God loves color
47:31
he created color he created everything
47:35
and he loves color he loves coloring
47:38
your hair on your clothes yeah I love
47:41
your purple dizzy you are rocking it and
47:47
yes he did tell me I would have pink
47:49
highlights in my hair I didn't I wasn't
47:52
a pink haired person trust me I was a
47:54
business person I had a wonderful job I
47:58
worked with CEOs I loved it I trained in
48:02
the business industry I've worked there
48:03
for 25 years and 10 he got really
48:06
strange and took me out and made me wear
48:08
pink hair started taking me to heaven
48:11
[Music]
48:13
he didn't even warn me didn't even warn
48:15
me okay he didn't warn me and I never
48:19
said I want pink and I want to go to
48:21
heaven all the time I didn't say that
48:23
I'm like I'm going to do whatever you
48:24
want me to do I'm going to speak for you
48:27
I'm going to breathe for you on a bu one
48:29
assistant want people to see when they
48:31
see me I want them to hear you when they
48:33
hear me I want to love like you love I
48:36
want to give like you give that's just
48:38
what I used to say to him all the time
48:40
you heard me all the time say that to
48:43
him and I would just take time and sit
48:45
in a room and I would just sit there and
48:46
tell how much I loved them I did that
48:50
day after day after day after day after
48:51
day and one day Jesus Christ walked
48:53
through the wall of my home for the
48:55
first time I was probably like 25 years
48:58
ago and he and he never stopped his
49:03
presence will consume me he begin to
49:05
share things with me I just was so much
49:07
in love with him I understand there's a
49:10
higher love than our physical law in
49:13
heaven that's what you experience you
49:15
you don't crave things like your
49:17
physical flesh did down here as far as
49:19
the love is concerned there's a much
49:21
higher love in heaven
49:22
trust me his name is Jesus Christ and so
49:27
I I was taken on this journey through my
49:29
whole life helped with all my siblings
49:31
I'm number 3 there were 15 of us we had
49:35
one bathroom that right there she had
49:39
killed yeah my brothers all thought they
49:43
were mr. wonderful they took more time
49:45
in the bathroom than any of the girls
49:46
did we were all a bunch of my mom used
49:51
to say I raised all chiefs and no
49:53
Indians okay and we all thought we knew
49:58
everything you didn't we didn't have
50:01
visitors in our home we did have victims
50:04
however
50:05
because we get you in a corner and we
50:08
would drill you and talk to you all of
50:10
us at the same time it was loud and
50:15
noisy but we had God it wasn't perfect
50:19
but we did know God amen and he raised
50:23
me that way on purpose so I would know
50:25
he was real and I know a lot of people
50:28
weren't raised that way they didn't have
50:30
a good childhood they didn't have
50:32
parents that loved them or they were
50:34
abandoned or rejected or worse they were
50:36
abused and we helped people like that so
50:39
I knew that stuff existed my dad would
50:42
move him in would love them we would
50:44
help people every way we can we give him
50:46
our food our clothes our furniture we
50:48
had never-ending changes in her
50:50
household we didn't have a decor okay it
50:53
was called giveaway that's what it was
50:55
we had giveaway furniture because we
50:57
always gave it away we found people who
51:00
had less than we did and we wanted to
51:03
help change their life and and you live
51:05
in the greatest time to be alive anew
51:06
because of what he's about to give us I
51:09
look at money as something to help
51:11
people to help to heal to bless we need
51:16
money
51:16
and Christ was extremely wealthy and I'm
51:20
also going to give you some revelation
51:21
before I actually start talking about
51:22
what I'm supposed to talk about my
51:26
introductions are exciting but I do
51:29
usually have a focused revelation to
51:32
give you focus you will be glad you know
51:36
that the last four years I have stood in
51:39
the middle of America on Resurrection
51:42
morning usually in the morning when I'm
51:45
supposed to be sleeping he even
51:47
stretches me and he'll give me stuff to
51:49
declare and release in the atmosphere at
51:51
a high level of authority that shocks
51:54
and shockwaves to the land through the
51:57
air through the sea and releases his
51:59
voice and his purposes in the earth I've
52:02
done that every single year that's where
52:04
I'll be next year and and then I say
52:07
things and I see in the spirit what
52:09
happened when I did it and we were
52:11
heading into powerful times we can't
52:13
escape it we just we cannot escape it
52:16
and my sister has recently given me not
52:19
Jen but one of my other sisters have
52:22
given me a key keys are one of the
52:24
symbols of the kingdom age if you don't
52:27
have like big keys or something to hang
52:28
around hang on get crowns symbols of
52:31
crowns keys peacock feathers are talking
52:34
about seers the seer anointing it also
52:37
represents royalty and the living
52:39
creatures and having this way have eyes
52:40
and their feathers
52:41
there's many defined things oops that
52:44
was anointing I just been on the
52:46
platform I just leave it up here so I do
52:51
that to my sister by mistake Jen she
52:53
goes you spit on me what you were highly
52:55
anointed now she says I have my own
52:59
anointing I know but don't spit on me so
53:04
he had me take this key she gave me no
53:06
this long it's got gems all the way out
53:09
the stem of the key around it but in the
53:11
middle is a magnifying glass and when
53:15
she handed to me God said this is a key
53:17
for clarity and he had me take that and
53:21
actually had me unlock a door of clarity
53:23
he had me unlock it first for President
53:26
Trump and vice president pounds that
53:28
they would have clarity and hear him
53:30
clearly and and have clarity in every
53:33
decision they made so watch for more
53:35
clarity in them I unlocked I literally
53:38
saw a spirit of clarity fly over 2 DC
53:41
into the White House and then he had me
53:45
unlock it again for the body of Christ
53:47
everybody say I receive clarity in my
53:52
life
53:53
[Applause]
53:54
it helps you focus it really helps you
53:58
focus because you it's very clear you
54:01
know the vision is clear to you what he
54:04
said it's clear to you the path is clear
54:06
to you that he's putting you on he put
54:08
you on a path he put you in a path he
54:12
put you on a path say I want God's path
54:15
not man God's path will get you where he
54:20
wants you to go and don't get pulled off
54:23
that path deception will pull you off
54:26
that path it will keep you all set past
54:28
and so you don't want that when you have
54:30
clarity and discernment you will be able
54:33
to recognize and identify deception and
54:37
we need that right now because there's
54:39
so much of it in the body of Christ and
54:43
so I took that key of clarity I unlocked
54:46
the door to clarity for the White House
54:50
and Trump and parents and their staff to
54:52
be more clearly focused on things but
54:55
he's pretty focused already and he's
54:58
going to get even more focused okay and
55:01
you're going to him talk more about
55:03
people think he's putting it on they
55:04
think he's making it up talking about
55:06
God he's not making up anything are you
55:09
kidding
55:10
four months before he ever got won the
55:13
election he was hearing from every major
55:15
prophet that knew what time it was okay
55:19
not the ones he thought right you know
55:22
get on your rapture rug you're going to
55:23
be rescued you know some people still
55:25
think that because they don't have
55:26
revelation and they don't know what time
55:28
it is but those who've been waiting for
55:31
this time in God to change our nation
55:34
because they knew he would change it all
55:36
of them went and met with him they would
55:37
prophesy to him he let them lay hands on
55:40
him pray over him everybody pray he
55:43
wanted as many hands and prayers that he
55:46
could get because he knew he wasn't
55:49
going to get that without God so he was
55:52
he was already on God's team whether he
55:55
sounded like nah
56:01
and I tell people you can get on the
56:03
foam team again in God's team because
56:05
he's already on God's team okay
56:09
but never in the history of our country
56:11
I've ever seen people really be drawn to
56:14
a candidate because they were hungry for
56:18
hope and he actually had a plan no one
56:23
else had the motto make America great
56:25
again okay everybody was saying
56:28
everything else and so now they're going
56:32
to have clarity more clarity he had me
56:34
declare and decree I took my king of
56:36
staff I have a king staff and he said
56:38
when you go out there you're going to
56:40
release top and you're getting an
56:41
impartation than the staff which means
56:44
more of God you know get a staff this
56:49
heaven culture get a staff write things
56:52
on the staff hang keys and crowns on the
56:55
staff you know that's not strange
56:58
command it might be but not to God you
57:01
know when you declared the Korean you
57:03
hit that staff seals it when you hit
57:06
that staff in the spirit realm it's like
57:08
a shock wave because I every time I hit
57:12
my staff I see a shock wave go out it
57:17
increases your level of faith because
57:20
you begin to actually feel what God is
57:23
giving you putting into you you hear
57:25
more clearly a staff was normal even
57:28
back in ancient times to have and how
57:31
many times to God speaks with the staff
57:33
or demonstrate to that staff right
57:35
parting of the Red Sea when it butted
57:37
remember Aaron's Robin that was a staff
57:40
how it but I mean all kinds of things he
57:42
did he have salt appear on the outside
57:46
of it sometimes guilty manifestations
57:49
like that for you you need to get
57:51
serious and show God I'm serious about
57:53
doing this stuff I want to live heaven
57:55
culture I want to demonstrate manners
57:57
for you I want to rule and reign with
57:59
Christ right now I'm so tired to end me
58:02
beating me up
58:04
and because we've been tolerating it we
58:09
have just been putting up with it we
58:11
have been participating and tolerating
58:14
what the enemy is doing to us and every
58:17
time you say I don't have I can't do I
58:21
never will
58:22
you're actually participating with the
58:25
enemy
58:26
because those are not God's words he has
58:31
great plans for you he wants you to run
58:33
your race he want you to live heaven
58:34
culture you have power over the enemy to
58:37
tread upon serpents and scorpions right
58:40
cast out demons heal the sick raise the
58:43
dead what is that stuff
58:45
those are super natural powers given by
58:50
Jesus Christ he gave you a deposit of
58:54
anointing that he walked in on the
58:57
source when you became born-again first
59:00
John 2:27 look it up when you receive
59:05
Jesus Christ you receive a deposit of
59:07
the anointing everybody say the
59:09
anointing breaks the yoke you carry that
59:16
you carry a break or anointing because
59:20
the anointing breaks the yoke and I says
59:22
he gave you a deposit of it but you have
59:24
to send it out and use it in order to
59:25
get more say to get more I have to
59:30
operate it the anointing was so great in
59:35
Peter that it wasn't his shadow that
59:37
healed people
59:38
it was the anointing that it was so
59:40
large outside of me like a cloud around
59:43
him and it went wherever he went and
59:45
when he walked with that anointing he
59:46
passed people they got healed so how
59:50
much more does he want us to do today
59:52
[Applause]
59:53
see you have weapons
59:56
he gave us weapons he didn't just say
59:59
well I love you you know and when you
60:01
get saved people go well now you're born
60:03
again you receive Christ in your heart
60:04
here's your Bible I'll pray for you some
60:08
churches mentor you some do I'm not
60:10
putting everybody in that same off but a
60:12
lot of them that's it you know come to
60:14
church will welcome you here we're happy
60:16
to have you here
60:17
they have a place where they can hear
60:18
the read hear the word of God and in the
60:20
past at least it wasn't twisted so make
60:25
sure you know what version of the Bible
60:26
you got everybody except Adams housecat
60:32
is writing a translation of the Bible
60:35
and some of them aren't good and some of
60:39
them aren't saved some of them weak
60:41
parts of the Bible out and call it a
60:43
Bible I went by one I'm not talking
60:47
about the older New Testament I'm
60:48
talking about they literally are taking
60:50
out parts of the Bible and leaving them
60:53
out because they have accountability in
60:56
them they have consequences they have a
61:02
protocol on how to operate they have
61:04
things that are required of you they
61:05
leave all those parts out the only the
61:08
part about the love of God and how
61:10
important special you are to God it's
61:12
okay to send all you want to I know what
61:16
the word says about sin you know why he
61:18
doesn't like it because you don't have
61:19
power over the enemy when you said
61:22
Christ said I give you power over all
61:24
the father said there's none of him and
61:26
me and you can live without him in you
61:30
trust me you don't need him anyway you
61:32
don't need the devil he doesn't like you
61:34
he doesn't want you kill steal and
61:36
destroy is his rule that's what he lives
61:38
by Christ comes to bring life and more
61:43
abundantly he comes to give you
61:45
authority and power and dominion over
61:48
the very earth the water the land the
61:50
sea all the creatures on you it's just
61:53
listed ruling and reigning with Christ
61:55
pushing back darkness casting out demons
61:57
the kingdom of heaven shows up when you
62:00
cast out demons I think that's what they
62:03
said in the Bible but when you play it
62:07
with a demon you can't cuss them out
62:11
some people think that's really cool to
62:13
do that by the way the earth itself
62:16
because I've seen the future is becoming
62:19
more and more spiritually oriented what
62:22
does that mean that means they'll
62:23
consider the spirit that they follow
62:25
before they will consider men's head
62:26
knowledge depending on what spirit they
62:29
follow they'll live in areas where they
62:31
where they operate in that spirit that's
62:33
and they're kids that believe in that
62:35
spirit to schools they will they're
62:38
going to work certain clothing that
62:39
demonstrates the images of that spirit
62:41
they follow they already kind of do that
62:44
because when you're a Muslim you wear
62:45
the clothing that represents that image
62:47
right even Buddhists you know and some
62:52
of the three-stage there has I mean they
62:53
do things because they're portraying an
62:55
image of what they believe in so that
62:57
means you need to have colored hair
62:59
we're the most radical clothes take
63:02
authority have power in your life you
63:05
know let your soul prosper because
63:07
that's his image that's heavens image
63:13
and we bring life hope joy celebration a
63:18
future a future the greatest future that
63:22
will ever be is what Jesus Christ brings
63:25
us say man and yet people need they want
63:28
to make him sound like oh he was in the
63:29
past you know they even water down what
63:32
he did none of that is true
63:34
it's an antichrist spirit anything us
63:38
against Jesus Christ you could you have
63:40
all different flavors of it out there
63:42
but it's still an antichrist spirit
63:44
anything that takes you away from Christ
63:45
or water's down his authority or who he
63:49
is is an antichrist spirit amen
63:53
this is a day to be great I remember
63:56
when he told me he told me this when I
63:59
was watching something I don't know if
64:01
you ever saw one time member there's
64:03
some movies I'll mention because I
64:05
actually watching that watch them you
64:06
need to know what's in the movies before
64:08
you watch them because frequency sounds
64:11
and images carry spirits with them and I
64:16
mean there's some really good movies
64:18
even secular movies just some good ones
64:19
out there that are watched they're fun
64:21
they're excited and you actually learn
64:22
something from it but you're not gonna
64:24
learn any
64:24
seeing from graphic violence sexuality
64:30
profane language that's not going to
64:33
cause your soul to prosper say Amen so
64:36
you choose with your will what you think
64:39
represents what God would want you to
64:41
have because he's for you he's not
64:43
against you in other words he actually
64:45
is taking Hollywood so for a long time
64:48
we'll have awesome amazing movies
64:50
produced from there he's taking
64:52
Hollywood many of them are becoming
64:58
born-again they're making them change
64:59
the scripts as they are filming them
65:03
because they're not the same people who
65:05
signed the contract see all things are
65:10
possible for cotton because you know if
65:13
Hollywood impact this world and they're
65:17
putting out words sounds images songs
65:22
frequencies and they release all kinds
65:25
of things in the spirit that you don't
65:27
see and people think it's all fantasy
65:29
and it's not when you get things that
65:33
make you feel good that make you laugh
65:35
that's like a medicine so they're
65:40
tweaking their movies I can tell you
65:42
already they're freaking them because
65:44
they're bombing some of their big big
65:46
ones they want to release our bombing
65:48
and they're losing money because the
65:50
same moral majority that help the
65:52
believers vote Trump in that same moral
65:55
majority in America are fed up with the
65:57
darkness in the movies
66:02
they don't want to feed their kids
66:05
witchcraft or demonic stuff they don't
66:08
want to they don't want to feed them New
66:10
Age stuff they don't want to feed them
66:12
that they want them to grow up and have
66:13
a future even secular of good moral
66:17
secular people don't want that stuff and
66:19
guess what they're the ones who spend
66:21
the money it's not the few liberals and
66:24
the wicked people out there that like
66:26
other wickedness they do they don't
66:28
they're not the ones the moral majority
66:30
in America is what goes to the movies
66:31
and if you make it too ugly hateful
66:34
damaging then they're not going to go
66:37
and there's some cartoon movies how much
66:41
are they making well let me tell you I
66:42
can tell you the long range of which is
66:44
dark in case you wonder they're
66:47
suffering at this not good and Johnny
66:49
Depp played in that movie he's a great
66:51
actor we need to win him to cry I
66:53
actually drove I his home and release
66:55
the anointing into it I just as I did I
67:01
know where some of those people live in
67:02
Hollywood I am bushwhacking them that
67:09
movie grossed eight million and I forgot
67:12
how many tens of millions it cost to
67:14
make it so they lost tens of millions of
67:17
dollars the same weekend they release a
67:19
kid's movie which was good
67:22
it made 82 million and that shows you
67:26
that's the way Hollywood is going
67:28
they'll make a really good superhero
67:29
movie and then the next time they make
67:31
it they make it darker well you're the
67:34
parents of 10 11 year olds don't want it
67:36
darker they like it way it was the first
67:38
time they made it right and then they
67:40
make it darker and then they don't take
67:42
them and then it's not making as much
67:43
money so I stick to Hollywood actually
67:46
go in the Beverly garland theater it's a
67:48
it's a theater where the movie stars go
67:51
and perform and do stuff and that's
67:52
where churches ric reitz churches there
67:55
and you must be come to speak to
67:56
Hollywood the producers director
67:58
scriptwriter screenwriter
67:59
special-effects people they all attend
68:02
this church and I have flat tell them if
68:05
you don't change what you're putting out
68:06
that you're gonna lose your shirt
68:09
and then this this is the floor Trump
68:13
was elected and I tell them I'm telling
68:16
you there's coming a time when the hand
68:18
of our government will not just put
68:20
extend their hand to the believer but
68:22
they will become a believer and then
68:24
want righteousness and godliness in our
68:26
country and it's going to start changing
68:28
the hearts of some people and you better
68:31
start producing better movies or they're
68:33
not going to come because God is about
68:35
to inhabit our country and many people
68:38
give us out to him and you won't have a
68:41
job anymore and I didn't care what they
68:45
thought about that because it's already
68:47
happening I said you better treat those
68:49
scriptures a whole big difference in
68:51
having peril in a movie for a child and
68:54
having death know three or four eyo
68:57
should have to watch something killing
68:58
something else
69:00
okay paral paral is one thing right you
69:03
know they could kind of think they would
69:05
know something's going to happen but to
69:07
show them that happening is unexcusable
69:09
it's inexcusable and it's not acceptable
69:12
by the moral majority of America nor by
69:15
the believers of America and and we have
69:17
a more votes than you do and we have
69:19
more money than you do and if you want
69:21
to sell your movies you better change
69:23
what you're doing and I was just as bold
69:28
to them as I was when I was because I
69:32
like to go to movies did you know God
69:34
loved stories if all this whole thing
69:36
with Jesus happened now they'd be
69:38
showing movies he'd be showing movie
69:39
instead of telling parables God started
69:44
all that there are movies in heaven you
69:47
don't you know you don't get to you
69:48
don't have to worry about any ratings oh
69:50
thank god amen
69:51
exciting intense funny powerful movies
69:56
that you can be in the movie or watch
69:58
the movie you're going to sit down and
70:00
watch it you go down the hall step in
70:01
the door you're in the movie acting
70:04
they're called reality theaters and it's
70:08
the first place they took me when it
70:09
took me to happen he said we're going to
70:12
show you how to have fun and I use the
70:16
old thing well I have fun when I'm with
70:17
you I have fun when I'm in your presence
70:18
I have fun going to all these meetings I
70:20
have fun listen these powerful people I
70:22
have fun worshipping egos I mean fun
70:23
like a child and so they took me to the
70:27
fun places like jello land in heaven the
70:31
amusement park in heaven where you see
70:34
all the aromas and you get to learn to
70:36
fly like Superman you probably know what
70:42
all your kids are doing they're living
70:43
out there that's the first place they
70:48
could have picked any place they're
70:49
taking the throne room you know they
70:50
could have done anything with me no they
70:52
took me to the fun places because he
70:54
wanted people know it is fun it'll rock
70:58
you mean fun so much fun in heaven and
71:00
so you want some of those things
71:02
invented and put on the earth and that
71:06
awesome and I also told these actors and
71:10
actresses and if you want to use your
71:12
gift you've ever going to happen because
71:14
in hell you do nothing okay and he'll
71:17
your gift won't be recognized it won't
71:19
be honored and it won't be used you
71:21
actually will have no life at all and
71:23
haven't you exist to live and hell you
71:26
exist to die die die die die die die
71:28
over and over and over and over again so
71:30
you want to die all the time or you want
71:33
to live
71:34
that was my short version of the gospel
71:39
life and death live death which one do
71:44
you that was simplified didn't take me
71:51
ten hours to give it to them and
71:53
actually many of them are really they're
71:55
cop name people I can't give you their
71:57
names because they have underground
71:59
churches but I mean really and God is
72:04
putting believers as very close friends
72:06
to some of the top stars that we have
72:08
now I know one of Tom Cruise's best
72:11
friends they're a prophet
72:14
that is speaking into his life God gave
72:19
him those gifts he wants her gift and
72:21
you know I used to complain a lot about
72:23
the evil the witness he goes well don't
72:25
you know they have a dark heart and even
72:27
though I gave him that gift what comes
72:29
out of their heart is what they will
72:30
produce as a man thinketh in his heart
72:33
so is he
72:35
so if your soul is dark are that you
72:38
will produce darkness he said but if I
72:40
if their one to me that same soul
72:43
they'll produce amazing powerful things
72:46
in the movie industry so we need to see
72:49
them from God's point of view right he
72:53
doesn't want them he gave them a gift
72:55
every good and perfect gift comes down
72:58
from the Father of lights which is what
73:01
you were before you were here why would
73:03
they say father of lice that doesn't
73:05
make sense
73:06
that doesn't mean the stars the moon and
73:08
stars know the father of light he is our
73:11
Father
73:12
we are his offspring that meant you are
73:15
a little spirit of light when you lived
73:18
in him he was your world he was your
73:21
only world and you would ride out on the
73:24
Rays of the rainbow you jump into
73:26
different colors your favorite colors
73:28
even had favorite colors when you lived
73:30
in him you jump on that favorite color
73:32
that bandied right out as far as it
73:33
would go and then when they come back
73:35
and you drive back again you rode in and
73:37
out of him all the time that's why you
73:41
like blue or red or green you are
73:43
connected to that when you were in him
73:45
and then not only back did you have
73:47
color all the stones of fire that had
73:50
this blue fire burning that's his
73:52
passion our God is they wot consuming it
73:56
really is in him it consumes when we
73:59
love him that love makes that fire shoot
74:02
up around those gemstones inside of him
74:03
which are the stones of fire that
74:05
Lucifer used to walk on he stepped
74:08
inside God and led worship how close was
74:13
he to him and yet he became defiled God
74:18
didn't do that God did not create Satan
74:20
by the way people were making why did
74:23
God make evil he didn't
74:25
lucifer chose to be evil
74:29
he doesn't create evil same to your
74:33
changing by the moment every more
74:35
revelation you hear you're getting
74:36
changed your soul is taking this your
74:39
soul is capturing it gets recorded it
74:41
actually gets stored in your soul that's
74:44
why I try to share as much as I can
74:45
because it's storing in your soul it
74:46
will start changing the way you think it
74:49
will change the way you see him and
74:50
yourself you came from that holy God he
74:55
was your life he sustained you you
74:58
didn't have to make choices even Adam
75:01
lived in there Adam was the first he
75:04
sent from himself when he breathed the
75:08
spirit of life into Adams body Adam
75:11
became a living soul
75:13
because then Adam had to make his own
75:15
choices and decisions he no longer lived
75:18
in him does it show you a whole
75:21
different way to see life he became a
75:25
living soul and that spirit of life was
75:28
you that's what you were that's what he
75:30
was he literally was breathing Adam
75:33
spirit man into that body and that's
75:38
when life begins when the spirit is
75:40
attached life begins a conception at
75:43
conception that father sends a little
75:46
spirit of life with the Holy Spirit who
75:48
goes inside the mother's womb and
75:50
attaches and knits it together to that
75:53
tiny dot of flesh your spirit was then
75:56
attached and that's when life began and
76:00
they know and your spirit is made out of
76:02
light and they found a few years ago the
76:05
scientist did that at the time of
76:07
conception there is a flash of light and
76:12
they don't know why but now you know why
76:16
because that was the Holy Spirit
76:18
knitting you together in your mother's
76:20
womb there's revelation on the word have
76:24
all that
76:26
he sent you from himself to live here to
76:30
have a body because you can't have
76:31
authority in this world without a body
76:34
that's why Satan wants to possess them
76:37
he himself just can't take over he would
76:40
have already done it right he needs
76:43
humans to be wicked and evil and do
76:45
stuff that's why God needs us to be
76:47
powerful on Justin righteous because we
76:49
have more power and authority than they
76:51
do those operating that way don't have
76:53
all the power and authority they just
76:55
don't mind demonstrating for the enemy
76:59
they don't mind demonstrating is about
77:01
time we stood up and demonstrate for God
77:05
and God said there will be people that
77:08
demonstrate manifest for him so so
77:11
powerfully and the way they live their
77:13
life that even physical enemies will
77:15
fear them because of what's controlling
77:19
them will be afraid of you it says that
77:24
Satan will flee from you if you resist
77:28
him if you put yourself under the hand
77:30
of God and you resist him by the way
77:32
that is a forward motion that's you
77:36
running your race that you take an
77:38
authority that you live in holy that you
77:40
speaking heaven culture that you making
77:42
the right choices with your will your
77:44
soul prospering every time you do that
77:46
you're pushing him further and further
77:48
away from you until you become so
77:50
dangerous he runs away from you that's
77:55
what a believer is supposed to look like
77:58
in this world and yet we were taught
78:01
just to hang on for the rapture I'm
78:04
thinking if God is so Palama again eight
78:07
years old in church if you were so
78:09
powerful if you're all knowing if we
78:12
belong to you why are we supposed to
78:14
hang on hang on to what if I was to live
78:17
in you I thought we had power over them
78:18
as much as cast out demons
78:20
what is this hanging on to get rescued
78:22
rescue from who because don't we have
78:26
power over the devil why are we being
78:28
rescued which movie rescuers we're
78:32
supposed to help rescue people to know
78:35
Christ is that right
78:36
[Music]
78:38
this is the way people should be
78:40
speaking from here this is what the
78:46
church is supposed to be saying we're
78:49
supposed to train you to do the work of
78:52
the ministry not train you to sit at
78:55
home and be in fear we're supposed to
78:58
train you to take authority over the
79:00
weather because we're over the weather
79:02
not under the weather Christ had
79:07
absolute authority over the weather and
79:09
we are joined ears is that right then we
79:13
should all be operating like that stop
79:17
telling people those horrible tornadoes
79:18
in our area you better get in the cellar
79:20
I'm not telling you not to do that
79:21
I'm saying as you go down there take
79:23
authority over them tell them they have
79:24
to stop and you you actually this is
79:30
like a progressive thing but if you
79:33
don't start saying it and stepping out
79:36
you're not going to have Authority
79:38
you're not going to have it okay what if
79:42
this is how you demonstrate you say
79:44
something you declare something and even
79:47
God God actually says command you me
79:51
that you have not because you ask not
79:54
that's like basic Christianity that's
79:57
your basic Kingsman that's just having
80:00
your mortgage paid and getting food in
80:01
your mouth that's basic asking is basic
80:06
declaring and decreeing because you know
80:10
who you are what he gave you it gets
80:12
established to you that's not you
80:15
begging for it so we need to get out a
80:22
baby Christianity I I use now it's okay
80:28
to ask I'm not saying don't ask if
80:30
you're still learning keep asking but
80:32
start declaring things like I will not
80:36
tolerate a storm is coming into my area
80:38
all the time and tearing up the land and
80:39
destroying people's homes I'm not
80:42
participating by communicating counting
80:45
everybody how horrible it is I'm gonna
80:47
start saying what's going to happen
80:50
that's taken authority over the weather
80:54
that standing in the middle of parts dry
80:57
land and commanding rain to come come
80:59
into low pressure system to form over
81:01
the area and beginning to rain a healing
81:04
rain not a destructive rain that was
81:10
given to us
81:15
he didn't leave you here alone when he
81:19
said I will never forsake you and I will
81:20
never leave you he meant that
81:21
yeah but he's waiting for you to say
81:23
something he's waiting to you to declare
81:29
something to decree something there's no
81:32
king in any nation that can rule if they
81:34
don't say something they have to they
81:37
have to give commands to people to have
81:39
to say what they want done this is going
81:41
to happen here this will go here I want
81:43
this run in here start living your life
81:45
like that if you have lack you're just
81:48
tell lack you're not participating with
81:50
it anymore
81:51
take it out the door and start calling
81:53
in the wealth of the wicked start
81:55
calling in more than enough supply
81:57
extreme extravagant supply extreme
82:01
extravagant finances then when you've
82:03
been saying that for a while you say I
82:04
demand extreme extravagant finances to
82:07
come because my god said it was mine
82:09
that I'm above and not beneath and I am
82:12
NOT poverty that he became poor that I
82:14
might be rich so I'm calling that in
82:16
right now I'm making a demand for nay
82:18
not demanding to god you're releasing in
82:21
the atmosphere that draws it because
82:23
you're ruling and reigning I know this
82:25
is going to be hard on some of you but
82:27
God Himself said kamini me he didn't say
82:30
beg say Amen he wants to hear you say
82:37
what is going to happen when you were so
82:40
full of him it comes on anyway when you
82:42
share with people did you know God made
82:45
everything did you know you've lived in
82:46
him do you know that you want you to
82:48
prosper and be in health see you're
82:50
saying it already but you're sharing it
82:52
when you release it in the atmosphere
82:53
and you say I am calling and commanding
82:56
this to come to me because God ordained
82:59
me to
82:59
Evon I am his son I'm not a doormat he
83:02
wants me to live above so I can prosper
83:04
and help people you're not hurting God
83:07
you're making him happy you're making
83:11
him happy she says to bless them that
83:16
curse you can say a blessing or you can
83:20
actually bless people instead of cursing
83:26
people that says something go buy him
83:27
something give it to him Wow you're
83:31
going to ruin the devil's day you'll
83:38
become even more terrified if you start
83:40
blessing people that are against you it
83:45
is fun it's an awful lot of fun
83:49
especially if you if you start saying
83:51
wonderful things to them while they're
83:53
cursing you huh
83:55
because enemy wants to shred you you
83:58
want to shred you he wants to wound you
84:00
then he wants you to fight back then
84:05
he's controlling you and the other
84:07
person but when you get to the point
84:09
where you refuse to fight back because
84:10
you're you you participate with them
84:12
when you do that by the way you died
84:16
your flesh and say I'm going to act like
84:19
God right now and when they're cursing
84:21
you and thrashing you did you know
84:23
you're wonderfully imperfectly made you
84:26
know God has great plans for you do you
84:28
know you're made in His image he wants
84:30
you to know him so much and they're
84:31
already their minds freaking out I don't
84:36
think you heard me did you not hear and
84:38
yet I pictured you got picture this
84:39
here's a demon sitting here saying
84:42
didn't you hear me curse you didn't you
84:45
hear what I said because you're saying
84:47
it and they're speaking it so when you
84:49
stop not letting impact you that demon
84:53
is powerless and he will begin to say
84:56
leave Leave leave Leave leave because
85:00
you're feeling that soul that person
85:02
with life and hope and the anointing
85:06
that's why you said blessing not curse
85:08
there's always reasons why you said
85:10
things because that makes you
85:12
a weapon against the enemy's plans and
85:15
pretty soon whoever's doing that is
85:17
either going to stop of the gunman ask
85:19
you and say how can you live that way
85:22
how can you love me when I have treated
85:25
you that way so you spoke something you
85:28
seated something into them and one day
85:30
that will open the door for you to share
85:32
with them this is who we are
85:37
I've had to do it many times in my life
85:40
I had to make all those choices myself
85:42
but the more I did it the easier it got
85:47
until nothing penetrated me and all I
85:50
would hear was what God wanted to say to
85:52
them and what I was sharing was what he
85:54
wanted to say to those people and then
85:56
they would get undone they would get
85:59
undone I actually could hear the demons
86:02
screaming that is leave Leave leave
86:03
Leave leave because they didn't want
86:07
that person to be filled with life we
86:10
had young people pull up to the
86:12
convenience store I stopped to get
86:13
something in order was I was waiting in
86:15
the car my sister and they were all
86:17
saying something about my hair by the
86:19
way which is great ministry tool they
86:23
roll the vicious interchange to roll the
86:25
window man that hair is hot that hair is
86:27
awesome you a rock star I would you
86:37
think I would usually ask them a
86:39
question instead I said well what do you
86:42
think it is we think this is about do
86:43
you like this do you think we should all
86:46
be allowed to have hair like this yeah
86:48
man that's awesome I said this is heaven
86:50
culture and then a shock wave sits into
86:53
all of them
86:54
I said I belong to Jesus Christ he likes
86:58
his pink hair and then they don't say to
87:02
you are that they're still all stare at
87:04
me wal that I know Jesus Christ and when
87:12
do you really what does he say to you oh
87:14

87:15
I said yeah they go well I go to church
87:19
so that's good that you go to church I
87:21
go to happen you think you can't
87:31
minister with this stuff let me tell you
87:33
what then every one of them are looking
87:36
at me well what does that mean that
87:38
means God loves you enough to catch me
87:42
up to heaven so I can tell you about it
87:44
you wear clothing that makes music and
87:46
change colors okay they have extreme
87:49
sports in heaven and you don't even have
87:51
to wear helmets I start talking about
87:54
the things they like and then they're
87:57
all like the ones on this side car
87:59
leaning over the other ones talked to me
88:02
out of the window and they said well I I
88:04
think God those people I think
88:06
everyone's going to go to heaven I said
88:09
well you know what I know God didn't God
88:12
doesn't want that because would you want
88:14
to go to heaven and have all the evil
88:16
and wickedness and crime in heaven well
88:17
of course I wouldn't I said then the
88:20
whole earth can't go to heaven
88:21
I said you hear about Jesus she said you
88:24
knew him right yes I know him you know
88:25
he died on the cross yeah he died on the
88:26
cross I said you know that gives you
88:28
power over the devil then everything
88:32
changed there is no devil oh no there's
88:37
no devil oh no he's not real he doesn't
88:39
exist now there's no devil I said but
88:42
I've seen hell and then they heard
88:43
screaming there is no hell they have
88:45
been to the church that taught them
88:46
deception oh no everybody's welcomed by
88:51
God everyone's going to heaven everyone
88:53
but there's no devil we don't want to
88:55
hear about that might you just talk
88:56
about Jesus we want to hear about Jesus
88:58
we don't want to hear about the devil
88:59
can you just talk about that I said no
89:01
because then you're not getting truth
89:03
and the truth makes you free
89:05
and then they were screaming let's leave
89:07
let's leave Jen and I are like holding
89:09
our hands releasing the anointing we
89:11
were sending so much anointing in that
89:13
car the demons were running out of the
89:15
car they were waiting on their friend in
89:18
the store they learn he went to the
89:19
store and screamed get out of here get
89:23
out get out get out and I said I didn't
89:26
get my IC I can't no leave it don't get
89:28
have to get out here because the demons
89:31
were being terrified and they were being
89:33
hurt by the words of a speaking because
89:36
the truth will make you free and as they
89:39
took off we sent all the hosts of heaven
89:41
after them to pull down every stronghold
89:43
of the demonic and their life just shred
89:47
the platforms anything ruling I mean we
89:49
with the whole host took after and they
89:50
were discovered the car bushwhack I said
89:57
some Graham on heaven was praying for
89:58
them generous at that we were license
90:08
our wheel kindly forgot what we went
90:09
there for which it wasn't that amazing
90:13
was a mystery that Mississippi in which
90:18
it all started because in my hair it all
90:22
started because my hair they were drawn
90:25
to it it says have we gone to the light
90:27
they just didn't know it would be P so
90:34
heaven is fun and therefore if you're
90:37
going to live heaven culture on this
90:39
earth you have to have fun in your life
90:42
I know we're all very you know a lot of
90:46
people are so serious and profound about
90:48
God and he's holy and you know they for
90:51
some reason they thought he never had
90:52
fun I don't know why if he said you must
90:54
be like little children to enter into
90:58
the kingdom of so why would he think he
91:02
wouldn't have fun I think he'd be in a
91:04
lot of trouble if we all showed up
91:05
thinking like little kids and there was
91:06
no fun to be had
91:09
so he planned fun on purpose and it was
91:14
there before it was here it was their
91:19
first kid well you making heaven sound
91:21
like yours no I'm not I make an earth
91:25
sound like heaven only it's better I
91:29
mean can you imagine being able to ride
91:32
on a dinosaur they do didn't happen they
91:38
ride on dinosaurs of every kind he ever
91:40
made is there the devil did not make
91:42
dinosaurs okay he cannot create life he
91:47
can't he creates the opposite right he's
91:50
the author of gasps not lies and so yes
91:55
everything everything in heaven is alive
91:57
the walls your wall speak junior mansion
91:59
the crystal sea has a voice the trees
92:02
saying the flowers sing the flowers
92:04
dance with you the birds sing everything
92:08
every every creature in heaven will sing
92:10
and talk to you there's a place called
92:12
the friendly forest where even the
92:17
pebbles will jump up and down
92:19
it says The Rock's cry out in heaven
92:24
they actually cry out you sit down by a
92:28
big boulder it'll turn its head and
92:30
again to tell you how awesome the king
92:32
of glory is
92:38
it's in the word it says the trees clap
92:43
their hand doesn't it
92:45
it says the waters rejoice all that is
92:49
in heaven to imagine going on a trip on
92:53
these great sailing ships that it says
92:55
in the word are there it says his great
92:58
great sail ships that go across the
93:00
crystal sea you're not just going on a
93:02
boat ride okay you're going into glory
93:05
clouds the whales come up and begin to
93:08
worship God the whales come up the
93:10
Sharks come up they worship God
93:12
everybody on that ship begins to worship
93:14
the lord of glory and then he comes
93:16
walking across the water and you see
93:20
these blinding like a million diamonds
93:23
is what Christ looks like so it's got a
93:26
million diamonds it gets closer and
93:27
closer to you and then he dims that
93:29
glory you see him face to face and you
93:32
get lost in his eyes you get lost and
93:35
that passion you have for you that love
93:38
he has for you and for the first time in
93:41
your life you'll know why he went to the
93:42
cause nothing could have kept him from
93:46
that but nobody made him go there he
93:50
willingly chose to go there for us
93:55
that's right so we have a way back to a
93:57
father who we lived in at one time
94:02
every baby that passes away is in heaven
94:07
every single baby
94:08
whether it was abortion what it was
94:10

94:12
the reason they're all in heaven he has
94:14
them all okay they're also living an
94:17
amazing fun life even little even little
94:21
tiny babies I've seen some this big
94:23

94:29
has them in heaven he holds him in his
94:31
hand and they play he bounces them on
94:33
his fingers
94:34
they grow little flowers this big whole
94:37
fields of them so these little babies
94:38
can run through them and pick them and
94:39
they stick them in each other's hair and
94:41
they're like sticking everywhere you
94:43
know they make little bouquets and go
94:45
take them to Jesus
94:47
they climb in the Kangaroos pockets and
94:50
go for hoppy rides they write on deer
94:53
they swim under the water
94:55
you've got play ponds for babies they
94:58
write on the turtles and the goldfish
95:00
under the water they slide down rainbow
95:03
bridges into the water
95:05
rainbows slides they're amazing
95:12
it is wonderful isn't it
95:14
everybody gets their baby back when they
95:17

95:21
them very little and they'll already
95:25
know you they already know you right now
95:26

95:31
they love their parents and if they were
95:34
aborted they forgive their parents they
95:36
forgive the people who are involved in
95:38
all of that Jesus fills their heart with
95:41
his love and from that moment on they
95:43
want them to come to heaven amen
95:46
father we declare and decree that all
95:48
father who gave up their babies who
95:51

96:25
for people's salvation because we are in
96:29

God amen they're enjoying yourself
97:12
they still love you every child loves
97:15
their parents to them it's like minutes
97:18
have gone by minutes I tell the story of
97:21
the time there was a couple that I think
97:24
the son was about seven and he passed
97:25
away and then 20 years later his mom was
97:30
on an operating table and died and was
97:31
caught up to heaven and she saw him
97:33
still seven playing in the streets of
97:37
gold and he runs up because bomb what
97:40
are you doing here see still call her
97:42
mom what are you doing here she goes
97:43
what are you doing she goes what do you
97:46
think I'm doing I'm playing with my
97:48
friends I have friends I'm playing with
97:52
my friends and she was so overjoyed and
97:55
overwhelmed she just couldn't take her
97:56
eyes off the beauty and splendor of
97:58
heaven and here he was saying I think he
98:01
was even either living with a
98:02
grandfather with his long he was living
98:04
with a family member in heaven he said
98:06
that he was having an awesome time
98:08
couldn't wait for to get there but he
98:09
looked there he goes but you're going
98:10
back and she didn't want to go back he
98:14
says you have to go back mom your life
98:16
isn't over you're not done your race
98:18
isn't over you got to go back and she
98:19
went back and then years after that her
98:22
husband traveled all over the world and
98:24
told that story that you will get your
98:26
children God is keeping your children
98:28
they're having an awesome time you're
98:30
going to get them back when you go to
98:31
heaven and so you don't even miss that
98:33
you know God doesn't mean he didn't take
98:36
your child away from you okay he's not
98:38
the author of death he's the author of
98:41
life I will say this to you if they ever
98:45
got a choice if they were ever given a
98:47
choice and God said you can stay and
98:52
here they are looking at the one that
98:54
they came from and you know that was
98:57
your home you know that you know he was
99:00
your home you you know
99:02
your home is heaven you know your home
99:04
here captivated by this Living God with
99:08
life flowing from him literally life
99:10
coming in and out of him you know he's
99:12
got eyes flames of fire and he reaches
99:15
out through all that glory and just
99:16
grabs you and hugs you and this is one
99:19
thing you know I don't think I could
99:22
exist away from him if you haven't been
99:26
there I've been there I know what that
99:28
feels like you're consumed with wave
99:32
after wave of this living love and glory
99:37
and power and revelation is flowing into
99:40
you by the second just standing in front
99:43
of them and you're like how can i how
99:47
can I leave how can I leave and then God
99:50
says I have all of your family in my
99:53
hand and and if you've declared over
99:56
them on the earth if they're declaring
99:58
over each other they're all going to
99:59
make it here because my word says if you
100:01
live if you abide in me and my word
100:04
abides in you you can ask what you will
100:06
and it shall be done unto you and if
100:08
they're standing for each other's
100:09
salvation if they don't if they don't
100:12
drop them we won't drop them and you'll
100:15
pursue them as much as you possibly can
100:17
to get them into heaven and those kids
100:20
jump into his arms and they go I'm
100:23
saying so if they had to make a choice
100:29
you can't don't get angry at God and
100:31
don't be angry with yourself they don't
100:34
want you to waste your life doing that
100:36
they want you to run your race make a
100:40
difference in this life do great things
100:43
for him because God has you in his hand
100:46
he has gum in his hand and one day
100:49
you'll never be away from them amen it's
100:52
a hope it's a promise he gives us I know
100:55
it hurts when they leave because you
100:58
have the greatest salt I ever that
101:01
powerful love makes a soul tie you're
101:03
still connected to them in the spirit
101:05
you know but they can hear and see you
101:07

103:10
race with celebration with joy with
103:16
wealth and with help that I received
103:21
amen I'm going to talk a little bit
103:34
about America before I end ok America
103:38
has a great future it has one of the
103:43
greatest futures except maybe Israel and
103:47
one you know there's two main places on
103:49
this earth that God focuses on all the
103:51
time one is his roar one is America and
103:55
I love telling this that God said he hit
103:59
us he hit us in Israel and he even wrote
104:04
it down je are us a LEM he meant it when
104:15
he said that to me because the USA would
104:19
be friends to Israel they would partner
104:22
with Israel they would pray for the
104:24
Peace of Jerusalem
104:25
they would support the people they would
104:28
back them by saying that is their land
104:30
God gave it to them we love the same God
104:33
worship the same God so he actually
104:36
planned this partnership before he even
104:39
made this earth so we have a great
104:42
destiny to be the Friends of Israel and
104:44
he said he didn't replace them people I
104:47
didn't even know what replacement
104:49
theology was I didn't even understand
104:51
that what do you mean he didn't never
104:52
say he replaced him ok
104:53
we are grafted in
104:56
because of them we can have a
104:59
relationship with the Living God amen
105:03
Christ came to die for the sins of this
105:07
world and then he also came to give
105:10
Dominion back to us that we had the
105:13
right to live a powerful exciting life
105:16
in this world as a believer amen
105:18
they were supposed to bring life to
105:21
people and hope to people and our
105:23
country has a great future and I will
105:26
tell you what the father said Trump will
105:29
sit in that White House for eight years
105:32
[Applause]
105:38
we're all those who are unhappy here in
105:41
this loose it from your soul because
105:45
parents will sit in the White House as
105:47
president for a year it's awesome
105:52
that makes a total of 16 years for him
105:58
he'll be around for 16 years he already
106:02
looks presidential and he is a
106:06
born-again believer is boring him seho
106:12
daily Bible studies in the in the White
106:15
House Bible studies and prayer meetings
106:18
every day they hold them in the White
106:20
House not because they have to because
106:24
they want to and then the person that
106:28
pen sticks as vice president will be
106:31
president for eight years after him
106:37
yes he is letting me prophesy 24 years
106:42
of righteousness in the white house
106:46
[Applause]
106:53
which means prosperity safety blessing
106:57
increase in inventions and creativity
107:01
joy and celebration in our country God
107:04
welcome back to our country that we can
107:07
preach the gospel anywhere we want to we
107:10
won't have any problem getting permits
107:11
no one's going to sue us for things
107:13
they're unreasonable because justice is
107:16
coming back to the Supreme Court so even
107:28
in this natural realm it is going to be
107:31
great to be an American and God said I
107:35
want you to stop focusing on the red or
107:39
the blue I want you to be red white and
107:41
blue and be an American okay don't look
107:46
at the parties anymore we were created
107:49
to be an American live in America being
107:52
born in America because of what it
107:54
stands for and so justice liberty and
107:57
freedom is what our name is as what God
108:01
calls America America is his gift and he
108:04
refuses to curse it especially since the
108:10
highest position in our land is saying
108:13
himself god bless america
108:17
[Laughter]
108:20
whoa yeah
108:24
[Applause]
108:27
[Laughter]
108:29
integrity is coming back to our country
108:31
okay and we are going to be a power
108:35
overseas in a good way
108:38
we are already rescuing we're going to
108:41
rescue nations that can't defend
108:42
themselves we're going to be able to
108:44
take the gospel freely because they will
108:47
welcome us because of the change in our
108:49
country there will be a time when there
108:54
will be no terror in our streets because
109:00
the devil won't want to be here and
109:06
let's all say this together the ISIS is
109:10
having a crisis they better give up
109:16
because he won't stop or shut up nope
109:22
the enemy I'm telling you the enemies of
109:24
our country are going to know they're
109:26
not our friends
109:28
okay those who don't want Israel that
109:31
don't like Israel that don't like
109:34
America they better rethink their plan
109:37
because we will be the ones who will be
109:39
ruling and reigning with our God in this
109:42
world shaking and changing shaping
109:45
nations and shaking governments amen we
109:48
will shift governments
109:51
[Applause]
109:57
we're having an all-american rally right
110:00
now that's what we're having
110:01
if anyone should have an American rally
110:04
it should be the church and now we
110:08
actually can the unrighteous love said
110:19
you could not speak from a political
110:22
platform in the church he is abolishing
110:26
that Trump is abolishing now
110:28
[Applause]
110:46
just yesterday just yesterday people if
110:50
you didn't know okay that was not wanted
110:55
by the people this is what how do we say
111:00
is no no where do we say America is for
111:07
the people by the people right so our
111:12
government works for us
111:15
they shouldn't be telling us what we
111:18
have to do they're not a dictator a man
111:22
what we vote on is what counts what we
111:27
want past is what counts right and it's
111:30
always going to be good it's not going
111:32
to be evil right but when things are
111:34
forced on you that is an illegal law
111:38
that was forced upon you and no more
111:42
abortion and I want you to know that I
111:48
said other countries are already being
111:50
influenced by our president because
111:53
about a week ago the leader of Poland
111:56
stood up and said we're making a new law
111:59
there will be no more abortions in
112:01
Poland
112:05
how about that
112:07
[Applause]
112:11
[Music]
112:15
[Applause]
112:33
amen how about that
112:47
our president made a decision and it
112:50
really is inspiring other leaders of all
112:53
the countries to do the same thing no
112:58
fear you're right they're actually there
113:02
meeting with him as fast as they can to
113:05
get wisdom and counsel from him because
113:08
he has he has a plan to make our country
113:10
great they want their countries great
113:11
and he's given them sound advice okay
113:17
they've never seen anyone as bold as our
113:20
president
113:21
[Applause]
113:26
yes he is not afraid of anybody or
113:30
anything he knows God put him in that
113:34
position and he knows God doesn't like
113:37
evil either and so he's going full steam
113:40
ahead and I tell you what he will rid
113:43
the ISIS from our country and I knew all
113:52
the stuff before he even won four times
113:56
face to face God the Father caught me up
114:00
and showed me his plan for America and
114:02
he said I have chosen him before this
114:07
world was made I timed his birth on the
114:10
earth the generations before him lay
114:13
down their life for the day of my son's
114:16
power and now Trump is willing in the
114:20
day of my son's power he's willing to
114:22
live this is the day of by the way if
114:25
you didn't know what that's not the day
114:26
of his wrath Jesus Christ has a day of
114:29
his wrath but he has a Dave his power
114:32
that he clearly talks about praying my
114:34
people be willing in the day of my power
114:37
is not the day of his wrath
114:41
you couldn't even put him together at
114:43
the same time the Davis powers when a
114:46
manifest has sons and daughters that
114:47
talk about in the book of Romans will
114:50
walk on this earth when the greater
114:52
works that Christ said we would do will
114:54
happen on this earth when the wealth of
114:56
the wicked will be given to us so we can
114:58
use it for him on this earth I'm not
115:01
talking about in heaven I'm not talking
115:03
about the millennial reign I'm talking
115:04
about right now and so he had to shift
115:07
our government he had to shift it so
115:11
that he would be welcomed right and so
115:14
that the hand of our government would be
115:17
extended to the believer
115:18
instead of slapped crushed down pushed
115:21
back stripped God out of our country by
115:24
the way that's been going on for some
115:25
time
115:27
because the enemy every single time he
115:30
could get in to remove something of God
115:32
and nobody did anything about it but
115:36
tolerated it and finally for the first
115:41
time the body of Christ actually did
115:43
something right
115:44
even before the election they all
115:46
started shouting your will your way in
115:50
our government today your will your way
115:54
on earth as it is in heaven your will
115:57
your way your choice today and the
116:02
millions of the body of Christ lay down
116:04
their differences and started saying
116:07
that and let me tell you being needed
116:10
our voice to be so we needed to say
116:12
something and we needed to passionately
116:15
say it and we did we did say it god
116:21
bless america
116:24
now that is agreeing with it we he wants
116:27
to do because he clearly says blessing
116:29
don't curse right and there are people
116:32
saying God's going to curse America it's
116:34
going to fall off the face of the map
116:35
it's going to split in half anarchy is
116:38
going to be in the streets everything is
116:40
going to be living in dumpsters they got
116:42
body bags in Missouri for all the
116:43
carnage it went on and on and what that
116:46
stuff is coming from hell
116:49
it is not coming from God because he
116:52
birthed America himself he named it for
116:55
himself the very first people who led
116:59
someone to the Lord in this country were
117:02
the Huguenots the Prophet Huguenots who
117:05
came to America for religious freedom
117:07
they were called the dancing Huguenots
117:10
they were prophets they would spin and
117:11
dance in the streets of France how about
117:15
that they came to America they landed on
117:17
the shore of Jacksonville while I live
117:20
and that's why I live there and when the
117:22
very first converts at Tim ik want
117:24
Indians were one that the gospel of
117:27
Jesus Christ and that marked this land
117:30
they came to mark this land for the
117:33
preaching of the gospel okay
117:36
in st. Augustine they claimed this land
117:39
for the Catholic Church and for Spain
117:42
they did not claim it for the preaching
117:45
of the gospel they did not want those
117:47
people here but it was too late too bad
117:50
they won the first converts they want
117:52
they saying the first Christian
117:54
Protestant song as they were coming
117:56
ashore they carried with them a monument
117:59
they made in France and brought this
118:01
this concrete monument and I can see
118:05
that Monument anytime I want to
118:06
they plan to the on the land I said
118:09
we're claiming this land for the
118:10
pitching the gospel for Jesus Christ and
118:13
on that monument is a huge shield when
118:16
Michael the Archangel holding a spirit
118:19
of Satan's neck who's on the ground so
118:27
there's there's a lot of open heaven
118:30
over the area I actually have been out
118:32
there and I actually could hear the
118:33
blood of the martyrs crying out saying
118:35
who will take up our banner who will
118:37
take take up our calls who will continue
118:40
the preaching of the gospel to win this
118:42
land for Jesus Christ
118:45
they had a divine purpose and they're
118:47
still declaring it there in heaven but
118:50
it says the blood cries out amen and so
118:55
they had a purpose for America and that
118:59
was God's purpose also so they came here
119:02
they listen to him they came here they
119:04
fought through all kinds of persecution
119:05
and all kinds of things on the ocean but
119:08
they came they did what he asked him to
119:10
do and I'm going to own a house on that
119:13
land where they came ashore one day
119:14
meant I want to be where heaven came
119:18
ashore and so I'm glad that I lived
119:24
there but you know what God is pouring
119:26
on his spirit everywhere he's got such
119:29
anointed places I will tell you I do not
119:32
care what they're saying and the voices
119:34
of the people in Colorado I don't care
119:37
what the proclaiming what they're saying
119:39
is legal is illegal to God with the
119:42
saying is right is wrong to God he's not
119:45
going to permit
119:46
tolerated because because this are going
119:51
to be a region of like yeah
119:58
[Applause]
120:10
yeah we're in agreement with that a man
120:17
you can have regions of light all over
120:19
America this is part of the future that
120:21
he showed me back in 1998 yeah this is
120:26
how long I knew this stoppers can happen
120:28
okay
120:29
he sure to show me stuff in 1998 when I
120:31
got baptized with fire it was powerful
120:35
it burns the world out of you it will
120:41
burn fear out of you it will make you
120:43
bold the fire will make you bold it's
120:46
hot it's mentioned in the Word of God
120:47
there's one coming after me who will
120:50
baptize you where the Holy Ghost and
120:52
with fire and I'm telling you I haven't
120:57
been the same since even since then but
120:59
he began for two weeks after that
121:01
happened I had open visions of the
121:04
future and I saw what was going to be
121:07
actually what's happening right now in
121:09
America I saw that so even before the
121:12
whole Trump campaign before ever that
121:14
even started I knew there'd be a time
121:16
that the hand of our government would be
121:17
extended to us I knew they would shift
121:20
our entire government and our nation and
121:23
so we've been shifted okay God said I'm
121:30
going to put my hand on that map and
121:31
turn it red and he did he did everything
121:35
he said he was going to do and if you go
121:36
back and listen to that stuff everything
121:38
he told me to say he's going to do it he
121:41
is going to have his way this is his
121:44
time when the kingdom of heaven is
121:46
coming to this earth and living in us
121:48
and we're living heaven culture on the
121:50
earth and let me tell you your lives
121:52
won't be the same again even the word
121:56
Christian won't mean the same thing this
121:59
is the day of his power when the
122:02
generation will taste of the powers of
122:04
the Millennial age and do all those
122:07
powerful things that the generations
122:09
before us paid a price so that we could
122:11
do them a mint
122:12
and it will spread all over this world
122:15
because it says the knowledge of the
122:18
glory will cover this earth like the
122:22
waters cover the sea so none of those
122:24
other nations are going to escape being
122:27
touched by the Living God amen you're
122:33
right
122:34
all of those nations let me tell you God
122:37
is definitely marked Italy I was there
122:39
when he marked it he sent me to the
122:42
Vatican and to do something in the
122:44
spirit and he sent me to the Colosseum
122:47
to declare stuff and in the spirit that
122:50
was going to be there's always been a
122:51
shockwave sent to that country and
122:53
anytime God marks something something
122:56
starts to begin you're going to see
122:57
evidence in the physical realm you're
122:59
going to see the enemy being stirred up
123:00
because he knows his days are numbered
123:02
okay and I do know this and every
123:05
Catholic might shiver when I say this
123:07
but there will be a time on this earth
123:09
when they don't worship Mary
123:12
[Applause]
123:15
he told me he told me there'll be a time
123:18
there'll be a pope that will have my ear
123:22
and there will be a pope that declares
123:26
that forever how long that lasts I don't
123:28
know how long it'll last that they will
123:30
not worship Me oh they'll worship Jesus
123:32
Christ they'll honor Mary but they will
123:36
not worship her and so there's major I'm
123:38
saying major changes coming to this
123:40
world major changes coming to this world
123:44
I'm not saying all evil will be wiped
123:46
off but it's going to be like pushed
123:48
back even into certain regions where
123:51
people will go just to sin or commit
123:53
crimes but you'll get to choose between
123:56
life or death light or darkness and so
124:00
this is what we're headed you God is
124:02
going to clearly define and people will
124:06
know who they serve they're going to
124:08
know what they're going to know who they
124:10
serve and nobody will outshine the body
124:13
of Christ they'll not out think out do
124:17
not even in sports not in business not
124:20
in any arena with a I'll do with the
124:22
body of Christ we'll begin to display
124:24
and manifest for God on this earth and
124:26
then people will want believers as their
124:32
friends instead of the way it is now
124:38
people how different will be it will be
124:40
drastically different and at the end of
124:44
that 24 years it won't be the same
124:47
country ok it will not be the same
124:49
country God said people will hear the
124:52
word America and they will thank God
124:54
[Applause]
124:56
they will think Jesus Christ helping God
124:59
they'll come here to find him not that
125:01
they can't find him everywhere but
125:02
there'll be so much God in our country
125:04
and so many believers standing up and
125:06
manifesting for him that they will come
125:09
here to find out what is it about that
125:11
country
125:13
so hang on to your hat
125:18
I know this is it we're going to get on
125:23
that wild rollercoaster ride but we
125:25
won't be in fear of ever falling off we
125:28
will enjoy the ride as something new
125:36
this coming is that children will
125:38
actually be honored and respected they
125:41
be looked and sought-after for wisdom
125:44
because God's going to give little
125:46
children wisdom that even adults don't
125:48
have they'll speak things and they will
125:51
happen because of the purity of their
125:53
hearts they won't be looked at as
125:55
someone just to babysit people who take
125:58
care of children will be some of the
125:59
most sought after if you could prove
126:01
that you who are righteous you know and
126:04
you haven't committed crimes and stuff
126:05
you will be paid a lot of money to watch
126:07
and care for children because they will
126:09
realize how precious they are how
126:12
important they are to God amen I
126:15
literally saw children ten years old
126:18
being the pastor of huge churches
126:23
because they lived righteously they can
126:27
try to reason everything away that God
126:29
was saying I mean mass healings were
126:32
taking place manifestations of heaven
126:34
were happening because children have
126:36
pure hearts so they will be looked at as
126:41
a soul being shaped for the future which
126:46
is what they are I mean children are a
126:49
blessing isn't that way sad children
126:52
were sent as a blessing he would have
126:54
sent them if he didn't want to if you
126:56
didn't intend for them to do things on
126:58
the earth he sends them he has to send
126:59
them right they all live in him but his
127:03
intent was to make this time-space
127:05
planet he made it so he could send them
127:08
from himself that's it give you another
127:13
view of the earth because he wanted us
127:17
to have flesh and in order to do that
127:20
his son had to have flesh put on him the
127:24
word didn't have flesh and yet he
127:27
created everything that we see and that
127:29
that we don't see
127:31
he made it yet he had to walk as a human
127:33
on this earth that was a big stretch
127:36
talk about a stretch by the way he
127:38
became poor when he left heaven by
127:41
heaven standards he was poor when he
127:44
left there by earth standards he was
127:47
never poor what came to him to bring him
127:50
the gold and all the spices and the oils
127:53
it was caravans it wasn't one camel with
127:59
one little package
128:02
it was caravans these wise men these
128:07
kings three from three different
128:10
countries travelled for two years and
128:14
brought all their food their tents their
128:18
servants their servants food there's
128:20
camel's food and they travel for two
128:22
years with all the supply plus carrying
128:25
wealth for the Son of God and what they
128:29
gave Joseph and Mary actually could have
128:31
provided for them for their entire life
128:33
so when they went into Egypt they didn't
128:36
have some hovel they had some of the
128:38
best homes with the best tutors for
128:41
Jesus to teach him they had the best
128:43
garments so he was raised in that way he
128:47
is the one who was living here as his
128:50
father his earthly father was a master
128:53
carpenter who was recognized in the city
128:57
gates and remembered generations after
129:00
he died
129:01
is he not Jesus the son of Joseph the
129:04
carpenter they didn't remember lousy
129:08
carpenters back then you don't remember
129:11
lousy carpenters but if somebody did a
129:13
good job you always remember them
129:15
because you use them over again right so
129:18
even the one you gave him to train him
129:21
and his gift Jesus was a master
129:23
carpenter he was sought after all the
129:25
time in the city especially by wealthy
129:28
people because they only wanted the best
129:29
carpenters to make their furniture and
129:31
build their homes so you can't tell me
129:34
he did not have money he was in demand
129:37
he was invited to all the weddings
129:39
because he always brought furniture as a
129:41
gift
129:43
and the water he turned into wine the
129:47
wine remember that turn the water into
129:49
wine
129:50
it was heavens line it wasn't earthly
129:53
wine it's a nice miracle to turn it into
129:57
earthly mind it's a greater miracle to
130:00
turn it into heavens wine so what they
130:04
served at that wedding they had never
130:05
had anything like it in their life it
130:07
was better than I ever had before was
130:09
because it didn't come from this world
130:11
there's another there's another whole
130:14
thing for you to see another viewpoint
130:15
for you to see the whole thing the first
130:17
miracle he did was he brought heavens
130:20
wine to earth he still brought heaven to
130:23
earth for a party amen
130:33
so Sistina I'm going to declare Oh
130:36
everybody and then we're going to end ok
130:40
I will be back I'll be back yes when God
130:52
offers you something you should always
130:54
say I receive it and let me tell you why
130:58
you should say that because he writes it
130:59
down when you say that he records all
131:04
the time he records your words amen
131:09
you're moving and when you get to
131:11
heaven you will know everything you
131:13
helped to change throughout your
131:15
lifetime you know every person you
131:18
impacted every nation everything that
131:20
went on you know how many times you
131:22
stopped hell ok you beat up hell with
131:25
your words you just you went every every
131:28
time you choose God over hell every time
131:31
you choose what's right all of heaven
131:33
celebrates so you cause heaven to
131:36
celebrate you cause hell to cry you
131:39
terrify their enemy you get him upset he
131:42
thinks you're nuts because he can't
131:43
figure you out
131:45
in other words you drive him not that
131:49
that's why we should take seriously what
131:52
he says in the word right declare and
131:55
decree it will be established unto you
131:56
right you're over the weather you have
131:59
authority over the weather over the
132:01
earth itself over the atmosphere you
132:03
change the atmosphere with your words
132:05
you create the atmosphere in your home a
132:07
habitation for heaven - you do it
132:09
yourself by the choices you make with
132:12
your will because your soul is powerful
132:16
even as your soul prospers you will
132:21
prosper and live in health so there is a
132:26
requirement people I remember everybody
132:28
would say Oh God wants us to prosper the
132:30
word says he desires above all though we
132:32
prosper but they never said what was
132:34
required and so I turned that around
132:38
even as you hear the requirement first
132:41
even as your soul prospers you will
132:44
prosper and you will be in hell that's a
132:47
lifestyle so we can be rich because it
132:52
became poor we can be in help because
132:55
our soul prospers every time he said
132:57
there would be that is a state of
132:58
existence so your will be done on earth
133:05
that is in heaven is a state of
133:08
existence

00:52
by the fire of his presence he will not
00:55
tolerate it in this state in this
00:58
country he is going to deal with it he
01:00
gonna do all that is not right he's
01:03
going to set it right and those who call
01:06
themselves his leaders that are lying
01:08
that are cheating their living sin and
01:12
pouring into the congregation you have
01:14
days you have weeks left to make it
01:17
right with him or he will remove you
01:19
from this earth he will not tell me what

01:27
your God he will not know you if you
01:30
don't change your ways you will not live
01:33

01:41
[Applause]
01:51
you were appointed by God to carry the

03:15

03:17

03:18

03:20

04:03
somebody put it on whatever I'm real
04:09
excited I always love coming here the
04:11
atmosphere is so powerful you know I'm
04:14
I'm telling you there are so many so
04:16
much of the Angelica's around here
04:18
always but there's always an increase
04:21
and that is a good thing when I come
04:24
back to a place and there's an increase
04:26
and heavens armies or even just game
04:29
roles and messengers describes the
04:30
couriers you know as is that me making
04:34
that sound
04:35
oh tight what my mind disconnects oh
04:45
it's okay I'm when the 15 it really
04:49
doesn't matter
04:50
you never had privacy in your entire
04:53
life you knew it was never gonna be
04:57
about you trust me just surrender and
04:59
love them all in the middle but they do
05:01
it yet and when you learn to do that
05:04
really your life is gonna be so simple
05:06
because you're not everything to be
05:08
concerned of what people think about you
05:09
is that still me is that my scarf how's
05:21
that yes okay yes yes well one day I'll
05:25
be standing up here speaking and then
05:27
I'll be gone
05:30
but I'll be right back
05:35
the father's really been showing me a
05:37
lot about the greater works and really
05:40
what a true manifested son and daughter
05:42
is and why did he even pick those titles
05:45
he didn't want to call you you know it's
05:47
not that you're not someone's husband or
05:49
wife or family member but but the father
05:52
sees us always as his sons and his
05:56
daughters that's why when you go to home
05:58
to heaven you get your own mansion just
06:01
don't say no okay you will love it
06:05
you'll be undone and you know what your
06:08
family can come stay with you for a
06:09
while then you can stay in theirs and
06:11
and people do that a lot in heaven you
06:13
know they just go visit each other's
06:15
mansions even if someone's gone just go
06:17
on in heaven and have a wonderful time
06:19
there because no one's gonna care
06:22
they're not worried about their stuff
06:23
being stolen or taken or damaged
06:25
they're so free and heaven I think one
06:29
of the earmarks of heaven culture being
06:32
lived on the earth as we will feel that
06:33
free about things and though in the
06:36
realms that we live in I'm you're gonna
06:39
hit me say realms and zones a whole lot
06:41
because that's how the father talks to
06:43
me they don't have like areas or
06:45
districts or you know they don't have
06:47
like earth titles in heaven but heavens
06:51
about to send a lot of those titles and
06:53
positions down here and so the territory
06:56
in heaven is marked out by zones and
06:59
realms and realms can be layered if
07:04
you've never heard me talk about the
07:06
father and even the way he may mean I'm
07:08
making this remark because of an email i
07:10
got i don't usually even get to see them
07:12
because there's like thousands of them
07:14
that come to me but i just happened to
07:17
see me laying there and it was to me and
07:18
i read it and they totally didn't
07:20
understand even about the soul that it's
07:23
made it is in three parts god has made
07:26
your entire being in layers your body
07:30
has layers your spirit man has layers
07:32
and your soul has layers because god's
07:37
not just up you know one level one
07:39
whatever god he's he's always deeper and
07:42
has more things that he releases into us
07:44
and ways to use us and so he didn't make
07:46
you just like a block of wood it's the
07:48
best way I could describe he didn't make
07:50
you you you're not made just like in one
07:52
way you have so many parts in you that
07:56
when you really begin to connect with
07:57
what each one of those mean and how to
07:59
use that you will become more more
08:01
powerful in him he'll be able to do more
08:04
with you and for you so just want to
08:07
encourage people step beyond your head
08:09
knowledge when you're when we're talking
08:11
about spiritual things because even the
08:15
spirit realm itself has layers I'm here
08:18
to do spirit round boot camp hey what is
08:24
that something you've almost known
08:25
nothing about your entire Christian life
08:28
unless you yourself are a seer or you
08:31
have a maybe God has shared deep
08:33
understanding of what the spirit realm
08:35
is but I've been in and out of that it's
08:38
probably more than even around on the
08:39
earth even on the roads and highways I
08:42
mean we have roads and highways SPMS
08:44
roads and highways and has waterways
08:46
that has Airways frequencies light you
08:50
travel on light in the spirit realm but
08:51
if you could see like super highways
08:53
going like this everywhere all the time
08:56
intertwine we sometimes in spirals
08:58
someone's like that and like sheets of
09:00
light coming down and taking you places
09:02
there's more activity in the unseen
09:05
realm then there is in the scene realm
09:07
because it is the original realm you're
09:11
in a temporal realm but you're a
09:14
supernatural being as a new creation you
09:19
know one day our bodies will be
09:20
glorified you'll go from mortality to
09:23
immortality if you don't know what that
09:25
means that means you can never sin never
09:27
die never get sick never fall from from
09:31
his from the position God's given you
09:33
and nobody can take anything away from
09:35
you that like on the earth God says
09:37
watch out for your crown that no man
09:40
take it from you
09:40
so I'm just gonna I'm going to drop
09:42
little scriptures in between while I'm
09:44
talking here tonight but I'm really here
09:47
to let you understand how real that
09:50
realm is
09:52
to me it is more real than the natural
09:55
realm heaven itself is a spiritual world
09:59
wrapped any spiritual realm but
10:03
spiritual beings living there it is a
10:06
literal realm it's the only way you can
10:08
say it you can't say it's a physical
10:09
realm you know you can't say that it is
10:12
a literal realm when you live a real
10:15
life like you really go into your
10:18
mansion you touch the walls you sit on
10:20
the furniture you know ride on beams of
10:22
light around heaven create rainbow
10:24
bridges by shouting glory to God across
10:26
a crystal sea you you travel on light
10:29
frequencies color billions of the
10:32
rainbow God sends himself to come and
10:34
get you twirls around you and brings you
10:36
back to his throne to spend time with
10:38
him it's a different way of life heaven
10:44
culture is totally different than the
10:45
way we live here because we're living
10:48
below what he always intended us to be
10:51
and do and if we keep remaining
10:57
disconnected from that spiritual place
11:01
on the unseen place this is the time on
11:04
earth where the unseen will be seen and
11:08
not just by the body of Christ but by
11:13
those in the world all over the world
11:15
and I have news for you the knowledge of
11:19
the glory will mostly go through the
11:22
spirit through the spirit realm travel
11:25
in and out instantly be somewhere go
11:27
share release and power people then step
11:30
back and be somewhere else in a few more
11:31
seconds that's what the Angels do if
11:34
they're sent on an assignment takes like
11:36
three seconds are done it can be
11:38
somewhere on the other side of the world
11:39
instantly they're there they'll deal
11:41
with the army of darkness you know bash
11:43
them really crush them throw them in a
11:46
dry place shred platforms they've been
11:48
ruling from for years
11:49
pull down strongholds and 3-seconds be
11:52
back
11:55
because the reason why we need to be
11:57
connected or at least start with an
12:00
understanding that place is real it's a
12:05
way of life it does not belong to Satan
12:09
or the New Age movement 4 years old we
12:13
heard about was you know the New Age
12:15
movement doing this and that and things
12:17
would appear and disappear and they
12:18
would shape-shift and go places and
12:20
that's just mocking what God has always
12:23
intended us for us to do but for good
12:27
the disciples did it it's part of heaven
12:31
and we all say Heaven's coming to earth
12:34
what does that mean that means your
12:35
life's gonna radically change many
12:39
things are going to end in your life and
12:41
you're gonna be done with them because
12:43
the more the old you get rid of your
12:45
habit your thoughts and your mindset
12:48
that through man's traditions we have
12:50
adapted to it because it's comfortable I
12:54
do not ever want to be comfortable again
12:57
I don't want to be boring nor do I want
13:00
to be bored so the body of Christ is
13:06
lacking heavily an understanding of that
13:10
unseen realm but they know it's there so
13:13
God's giving detailed revelation what is
13:15
it
13:16
how do we operate in it what does it
13:18
look like what does it do to this
13:20
physical realm where does this talk
13:23
about that and the word what did Christ
13:25
do in that what are the Angels doing
13:27
that what does war look like in the
13:30
heavenlies the heavenlies isn't talking
13:32
about the sky over your home they warn
13:35
that unseen place okay this physical
13:38
realm is wrapped around the spiritual
13:40
round not the other way around
13:42
it's wrapped around it because it's
13:46
temporal it's like you it's like you had
13:49
this beautiful home perfectly built and
13:51
amazing but you put a cover over it and
13:54
yet it was yours you owned it it was
13:57
yours you had the Builder you have it
13:58
living it use it enjoy it be blessed by
14:01
it and yet we're only seeing a covering
14:03
like what we have now is like owning a
14:05
tent
14:07
because it's not a true true picture of
14:10
what God has prepared for us to have to
14:13
own to operate with many places like in
14:17
heaven when you die and go home to
14:19
heaven you don't get one mansion Jesus
14:23
didn't say you get one he said there are
14:28
many many many many many many more than
14:34
I could ever count I've seen a mansion
14:37
several now they're the size of a whole
14:39
city like the city of New York
14:45
order the city of Atlanta anywhere one
14:48
mansion and all that property everything
14:52
on it belonged to one person probably
14:59
probably one of those grandma
15:01
intercessors you don't really know what
15:06
she did in that closet
15:09
they're probably times when she wasn't
15:11
even there
15:11
she looks we think ah she just stays in
15:20
that closet she probably wasn't in the
15:21
closet especially if you pray in tongues
15:29
a lot there's a clue for you the unknown
15:36
language for the unseen realm they kind
15:41
of go together don't they
15:45
Satan hates that language he's trying to
15:50
crush it you know wipe it out wrongly
15:55
accuse that wrongly accuse us we're
15:57
doing it because he's terrified of it he
15:59
can't understand it he doesn't know what
16:03
you're saying he just knows it's
16:05
dangerous against him it's part of the
16:09
spirit realm heavenly language heaven
16:15
unseen realm a heavenly language the
16:18
unknown language in the unseen realm
16:21
where the devil does not like it it's
16:25
always gonna be bad for him when he
16:27
hears people praying it because it's the
16:28
perfect prayer why because you're
16:31
totally agreeing with what's in that
16:34
spirit realm and the unseen around with
16:37
the unseen beings who were so powerful
16:39
God's unseen plans for us who are his
16:43
new creation won't be gonna when you
16:45
begin to pray that passionately and
16:47
fervently you move things and shift
16:51
things in the spirit one that will then
16:52
shift things in the earth we need to
16:57
really see that this is it's a real is
16:59
something that's real you mean of you
17:01
know touch it but sure can feel a
17:03
sometimes can't you I've been talking a
17:06
lot lately I think I think I've had like
17:14
80 meetings this year I probably got a
17:18
lot more before the end of this year
17:22
because people are finding out there's
17:24
something new in the earth it is self is
17:28
not new more ancient than we ever will
17:32
be I love hearing people talk about
17:36
having encounters like tonight about
17:39
people seeing the squirrel room in
17:41
heaven and or the mantle Hall of
17:45
Mantle's God names everything he loves
17:48
she named things when you go home to
17:50
heaven you get a white diamond not a
17:51
white river rock with a new name written
17:55
on it did you say a white stone that's a
18:00
gemstone yeah we get one and he's
18:04
writing this new nickname he has for you
18:06
that only you and he know when you come
18:09
home to heaven he gives it to you but
18:11
that's a white diamond and every
18:14
syllabus I've ever seen that talked
18:16
about that it was like a nice little
18:18
River Rock no it's not upon this rock
18:25
that's the rock of Revelation the rock
18:28
of love those are gemstones that's
18:33
what's inside the father the stone
18:34
of fire are in him that's why he is a
18:39
consuming there's much of the word that
18:44
actually confirms itself if you just
18:46
read a few scripture that doesn't make
18:47
any sense to you find the ones that
18:49
connects with and then you get
18:51
revelation out you go why you see it so
18:53
plainly and clearly but you have to
18:57
pursue that so the one thing the father
19:00
even says that the body of Christ is
19:02
lacking is is understanding of the
19:05
unseen realm even though he said
19:07
everything that is seen was made by that
19:11
which is unseen so we should have been
19:15
pursuing what is that unseen what does
19:16
that look like what goes down there
19:18
you'll find out when you go to heaven
19:24
someday maybe he won't die to go there
19:28
somebody should be saying Amen God is no
19:35
respecter of persons Elijah and Enoch
19:39
look more amazing than anyone I've seen
19:42
in heaven and look how long they've been
19:45
there in their bodies you hear them
19:50
before you see them that you hear the
19:52
frequency of the glory they carried you
19:58
hear it you hear them before you see
19:59
them everyone in this room has a
20:03
frequency you decide whether the volume
20:06
goes up or down every plant every animal
20:12
has frequencies in them the enemy can
20:16
also hear these frequencies say they're
20:20
unseen say it loud they're unseen but
20:26
they impact things
20:29
so you need to learn how to turn your
20:31
frequency up some people may be sitting
20:37
going where is this coming from
20:40
I've never heard of anything like this
20:42
before my life but it's in the word it's
20:47
in the word how many people this first
20:48
time you've ever heard me speak
20:50
okay well help them Jesus and I hope you
20:58
like pink hair because it's heaven
21:00
culture say on earth as it is in heaven
21:05
I need to think about changing my
21:09
parents to line up with having culture
21:19
we will be some of the most radical
21:21
people in this earth in the past I know
21:26
God hid us I was hidden for years and
21:30
years and years I had all kinds of
21:31
encounters did things new things but he
21:33
hid me he wasn't letting me say anything
21:35
to anybody and I didn't have a problem
21:37
not saying anything if he's asking you
21:40
to hide something don't say it but he's
21:43
asking you to say it don't hide it right
21:47
obedience is very key in this time and I
21:51
know a lot of scriptures to talk about
21:52
obedience especially the joy of
21:54
obedience yeah when you hit the joy of
21:57
obedience there's no longer consequences
21:59
if you disobey because disobedience
22:04
isn't in you it's not in your soul
22:06
there's not there's not a place in your
22:08
soul for sin for a fence for
22:12
disobedience because the new creation is
22:16
like Christ say Amen you have to stop
22:22
letting the devil push us around and
22:25
telling us who we are he knows full well
22:28
who we are and he's terrified of us and
22:32
I don't remind I don't mind reminding
22:35
him of that he even tries to say
22:37
something to me ago you are just
22:40
revealing the fact that you're 10
22:42
purified or you'd be trying to make that
22:45
statement to me that you know I'm not
22:47
receiving it don't waste your time we
22:55
should speak both II for God and you
22:59
might you can speak boldly even in a
23:00
quiet voice that doesn't mean everyone
23:02
has to be sound like me but you need to
23:06
live like I live you want to be free of
23:09
everything if you want to be victorious
23:12
if you want your soul to prosper if you
23:14
want to live in divine health if you
23:17
want to not be attacked by the enemy
23:19
I live heaven culture I've been doing it
23:23
now every single day of my life for four
23:25
years and my life changed when I started
23:28
doing it because what God is bringing to
23:31
this earth is not another revival man
23:37
has always controlled the revivals when
23:41
they first started they were powerful
23:42
you know why it was all God they would
23:45
let him have his will his way and that's
23:48
why it was it would be extreme sometimes
23:50
and the manifestations of the miracles
23:52
and the things that happened and to me
23:54
and started getting their hands all over
23:55
at they thought they could make it
23:58
better or they could make it happen here
24:00
but not over there then we want to do
24:02
this and change this and pretty soon it
24:04
was like gone it did a lot of good while
24:07
I was there but man can get their hands
24:10
on something that happens in a specific
24:12
place if it only happens in a place in a
24:16
certain building or in a certain piece
24:18
of property or even in a certain city
24:20
like Toronto or Brownsville or Lakeland
24:23
those who are areas that were saturated
24:26
with the revival and every one of them
24:29
ended by getting their hands on and yet
24:32
what's gonna happen now he's not a
24:33
revival it's much better he's not
24:37
reviving something old but he will build
24:41
on it he's not wiping it out like it
24:43
never happened but some of those people
24:46
who did that they're in heaven are
24:47
waiting on their rewards by the way we
24:50
live our life down here what we're
24:54
getting
24:55
habitation revivals em they ever you
25:01
know they flow the Evan fold in flow and
25:03
then they go a habitation builds and
25:07
builds and builds becomes more apparent
25:11
more seen by people more understood
25:13
sought after what is this your life is
25:16
changing why are these amazing things
25:18
why is the glory all over your home why
25:20
can I see it driving down the road three
25:22
miles from your home why does he flames
25:25
the fire on you when you're walking
25:26
around well you just got up why are
25:28
there flames of fire on the seat you
25:30
just sat on because you're inhabited by
25:37
the glory we will wear the glory like a
25:42
garment I used to tell Jesus I want to
25:47
wear you like a garment see I never said
25:50
anything normal my mom told me every day
25:51
my life I was strange you are so strange
25:55
I don't know what God will do with you
25:56
and whatever he wants to when you're
26:00
part of a tribe of 15 you want to be
26:02
different over just tell him I want to
26:07
wear you like a garment I'm putting you
26:09
on right now and I will just go out you
26:13
know but I caught Jesus and I would
26:15
think his thoughts and and run after his
26:18
ways and then it began to not be able to
26:21
take him off he wasn't just a garment
26:24
anymore
26:25
it was the glory and that glory builds
26:30
it says we will shine like the stars in
26:32
the heavens it said even the night will
26:35
be light running about you yes that's
26:36
exactly what that means it is a
26:40
spiritual substance from the spirit
26:44
realm from a spiritual God for his
26:48
spiritual Kingdom but if we don't even
26:51
know what that means how can we run
26:54
after it because we've heard forever and
26:59
ever
27:00
and if say it forever and ever and ever
27:04
we have gotten our three scriptures or
27:06
two song
27:07
and went home totally unchanged but
27:15
that's not what you wanted he said we go
27:17
from glory to glory to glory
27:21
that does not mean from the glory to the
27:25
pit the glory to the pit where am I
27:28
going the glory to the pit know where
27:30
the glory to the pit that's not even
27:34
that's not a witness that's certainly
27:35
not a good testimony and I know that the
27:39
word says you overcome and the word of
27:44
your and love unless oh I love that part
27:53
from my mama her friend sitting over
27:58
there and she said hello to you she
28:03
loves you my mama just went to
28:06
Saskatchewan Canada with me yeah she had
28:10
a lot of fun she's praying for people
28:11
couldn't help it she's talking next
28:15
moment I see her laying hands on people
28:16
bringing from home what you're supposed
28:18
to be enjoying and relaxing she goes I
28:21
am so we have to understand really who
28:29
we are you are a spiritual being you
28:33
always have been before the earth was
28:37
made you were in him you didn't have a
28:41
mansion in heaven to live and he didn't
28:43
say you know he didn't say way back when
28:45
you had a mansion we lived in and
28:47
there's nowhere in the violets who
28:48
actually lived on the earth in a
28:50
different body you didn't have a body
28:53
you couldn't have lived on the physical
28:55
earth without a body and had any kind of
28:58
authority or do anything because this is
29:01
a physical realm and if you don't have a
29:03
body you have no authority here if the
29:08
devil that were true that you had
29:10
authority in the spirit and your
29:11
spiritual body the devil would have
29:13
totally taken over and wiped out
29:15
anything he could that was left of God
29:17
but he can't do that that's what he
29:20
wants us to come
29:21
us and then he inhabit us and then he
29:24
has a body there are no zombies I hope
29:27
that doesn't disappoint you no aliens no
29:31
zombies people keep me emailing me the
29:36
craziest things I don't know where the
29:40
aliens are except me right here
29:49
if you believer you are also an alien we
29:54
are the aliens that's in the Bible to
30:00
Raelians we're not on this world we're
30:04
in this world a temporal world don't cry
30:07
when he folds it up like a garment
30:10
what's gonna happen to me where will I
30:12
go who cares you were the one who made
30:15
the first one I think I would trust him
30:19
to make the new earth where he will
30:23
climb on the New Jerusalem and move from
30:27
his home called heaven
30:29
to live on the new earth with all of us
30:32
together it will be our home he's even
30:35
willing to give up his home his house
30:37
his house is the world called heaven a
30:41
spiritual place it's good to know about
30:45
spiritual things and someone although
30:49
that word in today's world could mean
30:51
many things even the word faith could
30:54
mean many different things so heaven
30:58
culture they can't take that away from
30:59
us they don't even know what that is
31:05
they don't even know what that is the
31:08
devil had no idea that one day we would
31:10
be living on this earth like they live
31:12
in heaven free from him free from fear
31:17
free from black free from sickness
31:21
disease free from aging
31:26
I receive at people like there that is
31:34
nowhere in the world you need to read it
31:37
more than because the last age and this
31:44
earth before he folds out all the way
31:46
will be the Millennial age when Christ
31:49
in his glorified physical body super
31:54
glued to his spiritual body
31:56
I told me that's what immortal means no
32:03
more mortal flesh it's immortal flesh
32:07
and Christ looks amazing in his immortal
32:10
body he will sit on the throne in
32:12
Jerusalem for 1,000 years on this earth
32:16
so don't believe people they say the end
32:19
is here and we're leaving the earth is
32:23
going to explode by Planet X I don't
32:28
even know what that is is something out
32:29
there in space they found it and then
32:32
what no that's not in the Bible for
32:35
right now you know I'm not what do you
32:37
do about Planet X I'm nothing I'm gonna
32:39
go shopping after you buy my clothes so
32:43
I'll go speak bar places I am NOT
32:47
concerned about the CERN you probably
32:50
don't know who they are you don't need
32:51
to heaven is not concerned about the
32:54
CERN or the Nephilim or planned attacks
33:03
not even the rapture which will be a
33:08
celebration not a rescue party
33:18
if if that was gonna be a rush key
33:22
parties say until I come back hiding in
33:24
the mountains and eat the worst thing
33:25
you've ever had in your life c-rations
33:28
preach the gospel to the raccoons and
33:30
the bears but don't go out because it
33:34
might be dangerous no he didn't say that
33:38
he never told you to even be concerned
33:40
about the rapture he doesn't even know
33:43
according to the word Jesus Christ does
33:46
not know when the rapture will take
33:47
place you know why because that's not on
33:50
his priority list right now ruling and
33:53
reigning commanding the hosts of heaven
33:56
crushing the planes of darkness pushing
33:59
back create regions of glory handling
34:01
the wealth of the wicked of this world
34:03
being the heads of all the seven
34:05
mountains being out front not behind
34:11
being accelerated to the front of the
34:14
pack where people will know you and want
34:18
to know you and see you and want to know
34:20
what you have to say in other words I
34:22
said he's not hiding you anymore he's
34:26
going to reveal you like a fine painting
34:29
that he's been working on for years even
34:34
when you thought you forgot about you
34:35
you got stuff spilled on you was a mess
34:37
it looked like a big mess that was
34:38
buried under stuff no the whole time he
34:41
was working on you knowing what you
34:44
would become one day for him so we're
34:47
pretty much like wrapped around a big
34:49
art gallery right now on the earth she's
34:52
about to reveal some of the greatest
34:54
paintings he's ever made that's us and
34:59
we won't be able to hide I love what he
35:01
said to me when you've stepped into this
35:04
new time and you're running after it
35:06
you've gone too far
35:08
you can't go back it's too late to
35:13
escape being great
35:17
so if you want if you want a prophetic
35:20
word
35:20
there's your word you've gone too far
35:26
you can't go back it's too late to
35:31
escape being great what do you think the
35:41
greater works are because people go it
35:43
doesn't say that in the Bible do you
35:46
realize in your manuals for to operate
35:48
your microwave it has more than five
35:50
words printed on a page and the Bible
35:54
also does not talk about microwaves we
35:58
may have find out they're not so good
35:59
but we've been using them is that true
36:02
most of what you have our own isn't
36:05
mentioned literally in the Bible it says
36:08
knowledge will increase it says things
36:10
will be created in the earth there be
36:12
greater works than ever before even
36:13
greater than Christ did that that when a
36:15
manifesting sons and daughters walk upon
36:18
the earth the earth itself will be
36:19
healed by the glory that's why the earth
36:23
is in travail it doesn't mean the end
36:25
and it means the end of the way we've
36:27
all been living way below what God wants
36:29
us to and so why does he say be great
36:34
because you will be known and seen
36:37
operating in power and authority really
36:40
to the point where Satan flees from you
36:42
because you've submitted yourself under
36:45
the hand of God and you are resisting
36:47
him with your forward motion in the
36:50
kingdom instead of hiding sitting down
36:54
hoping nobody sees you or knows you get
36:56
over that because he's gonna pick people
37:00
out in front he wants you to stand up
37:04
and stand out why because Satan's been
37:08
doing it for generations he's been
37:13
showing up who he is all the people he's
37:15
marked and he's used they don't mind
37:18
showing off so God the habitation will
37:22
be a show case you wondered
37:24
the biggest show on earth is about to be
37:30
played out on this earth by us because
37:36
we are his sons and his daughters he had
37:39
the first big show it was held in heaven
37:42
when he kicked out Satan and all
37:45
one-third of the angels that was a show
37:47
they were celebrating trust me they
37:50
weren't crying
37:52
Lucifer decided to take over
37:55
they were so fed up with him by the time
37:57
God kicked him out they were celebrating
37:59
the other angels the Fallen ones may
38:05
have been crying I'm sure they thought
38:07
they were gonna win just like this last
38:09
election deception deception can
38:20
deception will deceive the deceiver
38:25
those who were used to spread lies yes
38:28
I'm going to the political platform God
38:30
is very political God has his own
38:37
parties called the holy party they have
38:41
a platform crush the darkness and rule
38:44
and reign push it back don't tolerate it
38:47
don't participate it don't participate
38:49
with it be a new creation shine like the
38:52
stars in the heaven that's their
38:53
platform I want that one it's light not
38:57
darkness all those angels thought they
39:02
were going to win because God had said
39:07
nothing the whole time Lucifer was
39:09
deceiving them he let every single one
39:12
of them be tested they only got to
39:13
choose once out of chose real carefully
39:17
they can't repent and they can't go back
39:19
he will not take them back they live
39:21
with him they believed a created being
39:24
over the Creator where they had been
39:27
with him if there was time it would have
39:30
been ages they knew who God the Great
39:32
Creator was they knew who the word was
39:34
they knew who Holy Spirit was they knew
39:35
they were in charge and
39:37
this this being thought he was taken
39:40
over and he he actually convinced them
39:44
that he was because God would say
39:45
nothing the whole time he was doing it
39:46
that's God's mo share my will my way
39:52
show my plan sit back see what happens
39:55
Darden showed up he kicked it out
39:59
he was cleansing heaven forever and they
40:04
cannot repent they cannot ever go back
40:07
to him
40:07
they were unseated and lost their place
40:12
because they chose deception and the
40:15
thing about deception is if you've
40:17
listened to it long enough you will
40:19
actually enter into it and then you will
40:21
try to deceive people with the same
40:22
deception you got and you can't tell
40:24
people they're deceived unless there's a
40:27
divine intervention unless there really
40:28
is a divine intervention or they have an
40:31
encounter with God if they've been
40:33
living that deception so long and saying
40:35
that non-stop every time they say it it
40:38
goes in their soul it convinces their
40:39
soul even more it filled their soul
40:43
filled their heart their mind everything
40:46
they thought about was the deception
40:47
then they acted it out by talking about
40:49
it and rebelling against what was truth
40:51
and it happened so much in this last
40:53
election never have I ever seen the soul
40:56
show up that was deceit and they don't
41:01
know what to do they don't they don't
41:03
know how to go back many of them can't
41:04
go back they can't even be who they were
41:06
before because when your soul gets
41:08
filled with it you become that and they
41:11
still can't get it I recently was in
41:14
five different countries international
41:15
countries and while I was there none of
41:18
these people knew me that approached me
41:20
but they figured I was an American
41:23
when do I
41:26
and they all asked me the same question
41:29
what do you think of your president and
41:33
I knew it was in her thoughts already
41:35
knew they were for him not against him
41:36
but they didn't tell me that I said I
41:38
won't tell you what I think I'll tell
41:40
you what 80% of America things I said we
41:44
love him we back him we believe that he
41:48
really cares we know he's gonna make
41:51
changes because he's already already
41:53
created a million jobs in less than a
41:57
year and so he's really proven and gods
42:02
actually gonna have me give him that
42:03
message I just gave you sent it to his
42:06
son Donald Jr tell your father this is
42:11
what God says about him you've gone too
42:14
far
42:15
you can't go back it's too late to
42:19
escape making America great and it will
42:28
be sighed the Living God because he's
42:32
running after it fiercely running after
42:36
him regardless of the mum barment sand
42:39
the words that have come against him he
42:43
won't let it penetrate him he won't let
42:44
it touch him and and other leaders of
42:48
other countries are taking notice
42:49
because these five international people
42:52
they were like one was a medical moments
42:54
a surgeon him and his wife were both
42:56
brain surgeons I think they had lived in
42:58
Canada but they had just been in the
43:00
Middle East getting more training and I
43:03
was on a tour bus in Italy and he told
43:06
his wife I'm gonna go sit by her
43:09
she said okay she must be used to it and
43:13
he was the first one who asked me that
43:15
Elmo would you mind tell me what you
43:17
think about your president and I could
43:18
see his wheels
43:19
I see like little flags on Trump Trump
43:21
Trump Trump in his mind like I guess yes
43:29
because I look pretty happy and that's
43:33
what I told him I'll tell you what 80%
43:34
of America thinks that I am I said they
43:38
have lied the other side the liberal
43:41
media have lied from the very beginning
43:43
because they were controlled by the
43:44
enemy and darkness they didn't want God
43:47
anywhere they wanted somebody and even
43:49
even some of the Republican hierarchy
43:52
that have been around for a long time
43:53
have controlled for years years and
43:56
years and years control they want
43:57
someone they could control and the same
44:00
thing of democratic said they didn't
44:01
want someone who could run over them or
44:04
beyond them they want a puppet so God
44:08
needed someone who was not a puppet and
44:12
I'm actually telling this secular person
44:14
this I'm telling what God said about him
44:17
he was loving it well I'll tell you
44:21
right now we like him we were rooting
44:24
for him all along and I said he said I
44:28
don't usually pray I was really praying
44:30
he would win
44:31
[Laughter]
44:36
and he said he said I had to ask you
44:39
because what we're hearing on the news
44:41
it just doesn't line up because the
44:45
people are always still there whatever
44:47
he goes that people are there and when
44:49
he's reporting on his own public
44:51
Facebook page which they all watched
44:53
then he went there to find out what was
44:56
really going on and their armies
44:59
meticulously was about letting the
45:00
American people know what was going on
45:02
and he said we were really for him he
45:05
said I have hundreds of friends and we
45:09
were all kept having conversations about
45:11
him saying why are they saying he's
45:13
losing why are they saying that that
45:16
doesn't even make sense in our head when
45:18
we see the rallies and we see tens of
45:20
thousands of people there and the other
45:23
side had a handful if they had if they
45:26
have one and I went because they were
45:29
afraid they're afraid of somebody who
45:32
really would get something done and that
45:35
would do what the people wanted done
45:37
because it's for the people by the
45:40
people and I said and he's a people I
45:42
said he's a people he's not a politician
45:45
so he was overwhelmed and overjoyed he
45:48
said I know even when I was in Canada
45:50
they were all talking about him because
45:53
they said whatever happens in America
45:54
happens in Canada I just got back from
45:57
there they are still cheering him on
45:59
they want a killer to become like
46:02
America now
46:05
they want Canada to be free to be
46:09
prosperous did not have liberality on
46:12
every single street corner crushing the
46:15
rights of believers or just everyday
46:18
people they were saying just everyday
46:20
people you know they don't have a life
46:22
it's controlled so they're all praying
46:24
that other the one out of there or else
46:26
he gets changed and let me tell you they
46:30
have behind the scenes people who are
46:32
grassroots strong believers coming up in
46:35
that line and I actually might driver
46:38
what I was there was one of those people
46:41
who has actually already run one one of
46:45
the minor elections and his goal is to
46:48
become Prime Minister strong strong
46:54
strong believer he has a huge following
46:56
and again it's almost the same there
46:58
that the news that our theater spirit is
47:00
not telling the truth and so let me tell
47:03
you they're running after God being in
47:05
their country so they kept prayin you
47:07
know the leaders are praying trumpet
47:09
when yet the businessman was also kind
47:12
of praying he would win because they
47:15
have big business deals with our country
47:16
and they want businesses left to do
47:18
business with and so it was really
47:21
strange that I have one ask you in in
47:23
Spain and France in Germany and Canada
47:28
someone from London it was and they all
47:31
asked me the same thing in different
47:33
places on different days but when they
47:36
started looking at me one here comes the
47:38
question and they all said what do you
47:42
think about Trump I mean I think God
47:44
chose him I think God appointed him I
47:46
think he anointed him I think he's gonna
47:48
do exactly what God wants and I'm just
47:50
letting you know to have some good news
47:52
he'll be there for eight years and then
47:54
pants and then whoever pence picks will
47:55
be there for eight years so I will tell
47:57
you from the Creator the heavens in
47:58
earth there will be 24 years of
48:00
righteousness in the White House
48:10
and I said whether you understand what
48:13
I'm gonna say this is a spiritual war a
48:16
spiritual battle not a natural battle
48:20
this is a spiritual battle because it's
48:22
very clear to see there is good there's
48:24
evil there's darkness there's light but
48:27
in this time light winds I said God you
48:32
made this earth has a plan for this
48:35
earth and this habitation he's bringing
48:39
I don't care who they are and you would
48:40
not talk to them the habitation is
48:42
coming of God in us being seen around
48:45
the world new creations like fuel from
48:49
outer space that will cost almost
48:50
nothing then they were really getting
48:51
excited
48:52
I said many new inventions would she say
48:56
for this very time that we're living in
48:58
you will see them happening and so then
49:02
if you can ask people what are those
49:03
inventions they didn't care who it was
49:05
they didn't care if I was preaching the
49:06
gospel town about Jesus you know why
49:08
because hope was in that message but
49:12
every one of them as same question I
49:14
said well this is God's time this is why
49:16
it's happening I know anyone but this is
49:18
God's plan do you find people in leaders
49:21
who can't be bought sold shaken or used
49:26
that actually want justice and freedom
49:29
and some of them may be believers some
49:31
may not be believers but I really
49:33
believe God's gonna get them in the end
49:36
there has to be a time when this earth
49:39
is experiencing that and the gray area
49:42
says there is no God is erased and
49:45
sometimes you'll just use secular people
49:47
people who are not believers but let me
49:49
tell you if they still hang around long
49:51
they're gonna become one so we as
49:55
believers even more than the world
49:57
should understand there is a spiritual
49:59
realm there is unseen activity from both
50:02
sides in that place is actually unseen
50:05
buildings and properties that are
50:07
created in the spirit realm to be used
50:10
as Satan uses song the host you some the
50:13
Gabriel's group uses some of them
50:15
and that activities always happened but
50:18
in this time we're gonna begin to see it
50:19
and you actually drive into an area and
50:22
you'll feel God you feel his presence so
50:26
powerfully sweeping to your car sweeping
50:29
to you sweeping to the office where
50:31
you're working because a region of light
50:33
is being created in the area because of
50:36
the habitation of our God in us because
50:43
Christ in us is the hope of glory that's
50:51
a powerful statement but understanding
50:53
what that means is even more powerful
50:54
and the wonder of it all and she doesn't
50:59
really care about your education or your
51:02
age even where you live what color your
51:06
skin is what kind of food you eat or
51:09
don't fit or don't eat you know and I'm
51:13
just gonna give this from heaven for
51:14
free on trial the Holy Spirit says this
51:16
tell them that you don't have to be
51:20
baptized in the Holy Spirit or baptized
51:22
in water or go to church every single
51:25
day of your life or necessarily even pay
51:27
ties that is not those things won't take
51:29
you to hell but those are being preached
51:34
you give because you want to give when
51:37
you give it shall be given unto you when
51:40
you honor the Lord with your 10% he'll
51:42
do more that 90% probably double it
51:44
triple it than you ever could do with
51:46
that 100% it is a blessing and an honor
51:50
to give and in these days you really be
51:56
glad you did even if that was in the
51:58
past you'll be so glad you did that
52:00
because you were feeding for your future
52:02
wealth it is one of the signs of the
52:07
kingdom age being on the earth and how
52:11
many times did Jesus even acquainted to
52:13
money or wealth or gems because it was
52:19
that valuable and he's trying to get
52:22
that message cause you know is the value
52:25
what if you find a pearl of great price
52:27
you sell everything you have that means
52:29
you
52:29
up surrender whatever is getting in your
52:31
way lay down your mindsets your your
52:34
anger issues your whatever your own what
52:37
do you think is gonna happen your
52:38
assumptions lay them down and run after
52:41
that pearl of great price run into the
52:43
kingdom go forward ruling reign with
52:45
Christ in this time and years that God
52:47
actually created this time there were
52:50
Scrolls of time opened in heaven in 2012
52:55
I've seen many Scrolls in heaven I've
52:58
seen angels bringing Scrolls when
53:00
actually brought one to me my husband
53:01
was with me and dropped it in my spirit
53:04
that was not strange to me because it's
53:09
a spiritual thing for a spiritual
53:11
Kingdom for spiritual time on the earth
53:13
and what the scroll was talking about
53:16
was about operating with the hosts of
53:18
heaven as one of your greatest weapons
53:22
and it does change your life and the
53:27
mindset of the traditional legalistic or
53:30
religious God didn't create religion
53:34
however God did use that for a time he
53:37
did when it was all he had on you that
53:39
he could use he did but he wants a
53:42
relationship and your relationship with
53:46
him will determine how far you go to
53:49
become a priest a Lord or a king those
53:52
or eternal positions also given and
53:56
worked out and ruled with in the spirit
54:01
realm there are spiritual crowns their
54:05
spiritual Mantle's being given out right
54:08
now they'll all have to do is ruling and
54:10
reigning and people say it doesn't say
54:13
to the Bible oh I don't have time
54:14
anymore to try to explain to you just go
54:16
start looking for it he has a kingdom he
54:22
invited us into his kingdom nothing
54:25
could stop it from coming nothing can
54:28
stop the habitation of heaven on this
54:30
earth and everybody who was a believer
54:32
from the time jesus said pray this way
54:34
has been calling it in in the spirit
54:37
with a frequency in their voice they
54:40
knew that was a word they knew the Lord
54:42
had said to say that
54:43
that was a safe scripture in red and so
54:50
the ones that are brother they really
54:51
say a lot
54:52
well that was Jesus's playing all along
54:54
he highlighted it he knew they say it
54:57
regardless of the battles of the
54:59
denominations or the non denominations
55:02
or the inter denominations he knew that
55:07
he could get them to agree on that
55:08
scripture calling in one of the most
55:10
important times on the earth called the
55:11
kingdom age where we will wield crowns
55:16
and be kings and priests unto our God
55:20
spiritual kings and priests to a
55:22
spiritual King and priests so important
55:26
was it to Christ that he wrote that time
55:29
on his very being
55:30
I am the king of kings and the Lord of
55:35
lords those are spiritual positions of
55:39
authority extremely important to him
55:43
because that meant those people
55:44
understood there was a spirit realm it's
55:46
where we all came from on the inside of
55:49
us we are a spirit and have a spiritual
55:52
body that gives us absolute authority
55:54
and Dominion through Jesus Christ over
55:56
any demon any power of Darkness no
55:59
matter where it is what it is one is
56:00
doing it we have power over it and those
56:04
went after it and they made a huge
56:07
difference their lives begin to change
56:09
that's cut manifesting for Christ but
56:14
when people start disappearing and
56:15
coming back in front of you and angels
56:20
are with them at their side holding
56:23
gifts for everybody who is present God
56:28
loves to give gifts he's your father one
56:32
of the number one things they do all
56:34
over heaven is give gifts and they're
56:37
tangible gifts they're not just
56:39
something that floats around heaven is a
56:42
tangible literal world where you have
56:44
real mansions and beautiful amazing
56:46
things to have and to give away to
56:48
people and your loved ones have been
56:50
getting a gift every birthday you've
56:52
ever had since you were apart putting it
56:54
in your mansion until you have your
56:56
welcome home party
56:56
one day gives her everywhere because
56:59
people use their gifts every good and
57:04
perfect gift comes down from the Father
57:08
of lights those lights
57:11
were you before you came here God is he
57:20
says don't let your hide under a basket
57:23
but let your shine those are spiritual
57:30
things all of them accept the gift he's
57:35
talking about your natural gift that he
57:37
put in you that you can use right now on
57:39
this earth because in heaven you will
57:41
use it all the time your passion your
57:44
greatest delight your pleasure whether
57:47
it's a baker or you hold rodeos antique
57:49
car shows whether you create amusement
57:53
parks whatever your natural gift is if
57:56
you're an interior designer a fashion
57:58
designer a jeweler all these wonderful
58:01
amazing things that we wouldn't have
58:03
anything in this room if those people
58:05
didn't use their gifts athletes have
58:08
gifts actors and actresses screenwriters
58:13
script writers special effects people
58:15
you don't know what special effects are
58:16
do you see a movie in heaven they don't
58:20
even have to give them ratings because
58:21
none of them are rotten because the
58:26
minute I say that in persons human mind
58:29
in your national mind ago they would not
58:32
show movies in heaven why not like they
58:35
have down here you didn't write those
58:39
scripts but when you operate with your
58:43
gift and there's light in your heart
58:47
then what you produce will be light
58:51
whatever gift he gave you if there's
58:54
darkness in you guess what you're gonna
58:56
produce out of you darkness dark movies
58:59
dark music dark images on everything out
59:04
there the marks of the enemy on
59:06
everything
59:07
his words being
59:09
you'd everywhere because those people
59:13
are filled with darkness but God gave
59:15
them that gift he made them that gives
59:18
you corrected me he made them that gift
59:22
he made them that gift that's why people
59:24
are drawn to them that in these days
59:27
they're gonna be drawn to your gift when
59:32
he said your gifts will make room for
59:33
you and bring you before great people
59:35
he's not talking about being an
59:36
intercessor he's not he's talking about
59:40
your natural gift if you're an artist if
59:43
you're an electrical engineer if you
59:45
know hi-tech and how to put it together
59:48
create amazing things that gift that you
59:52
dream about think about probably knew
59:55
what it was when you were a child and
59:56
you kind of just let it fade away
59:58
because you were so busy being what
60:01
people said you should be every single
60:04
person has one or you are one that's why
60:10
he says every good so it said there's
60:12
not rotten movies in heaven every good
60:16
and perfect gift no matter what it is
60:20
you want to do on the earth creep if you
60:22
could do and make a living that's your
60:24
gift if you could do it your whole time
60:27
and make good money doing it because you
60:29
love it you're blessed by it you're
60:30
passionate about it a photographer I'm a
60:34
photographer button I'm always a little
60:37
I knew I know I'm being a Revelator
60:39
right now but in heaven guess what I'll
60:41
be a photographer and I will be excited
60:45
because it is my passion I collect old
60:48
SLR cameras you know what that is single
60:51
lens reflex that means there's nothing
60:53
what do you call that nothing automatic
60:56
about it every frame you have to set the
61:01
frame the light meter you have to focus
61:04
every single picture you take make sure
61:07
there's enough light it's in focus
61:09
everyone and I love it and I'm good at
61:12
it because it's it's me I am a
61:16
photographer it's my passion it's my
61:18
sister's passion my brother's passion we
61:20
have a bunch of in our family
61:21
I love photography where would be
61:25
without it right we wouldn't have any
61:28
visual anything no matter what form of
61:31
media you use it in you know when
61:34
someone has a gift and someone doesn't
61:36
have a gift I have a guarantee I never
61:39
had any classes I can stand in front of
61:41
anything for five hours and take so many
61:43
different images of that using light the
61:45
texture the definition the depth of the
61:48
different lights that are in there the
61:49
colors are in there or even the
61:51
materials that is made out of whether
61:53
it's rough or smoother or soft or you
61:56
can change it by putting light on it it
61:59
fascinates me because I'm a photographer
62:03
so when you feel that way about things
62:06
that's your gift that's you every good
62:10
and perfect gift so when we use that
62:14
gift even is to give it away it blesses
62:16
God if we use it just to help people
62:18
maybe it's not what you do for a living
62:20
but in this time of year things are
62:23
going to change because living heaven
62:26
culture get this the difference about
62:29
being living on earth as they do in
62:31
heaven they use their gift so if we're
62:37
gonna live on earth as they do in heaven
62:39
we will begin to use our gift and
62:42
actually make money for doing it because
62:46
God's gonna highlight that gift it'll be
62:49
amazing he'll make sure it gets out
62:50
there and it will draw people to you
62:52
because of the gift can you see that
62:56
there's some people if you make
62:58
something so amazing you're really good
63:00
and amazing they don't care whether you
63:01
know Jesus Christ or not but they will
63:02
come and seek you out because of the
63:06
gift they will make room for you and
63:09
take you before great people
63:11
it is so major to know what your gift is
63:16
even in the spiritual world called
63:19
heaven they use that gift so we have to
63:24
have more understanding of what and the
63:27
word is talking about spiritual things
63:28
this is one more thing I'm going to talk
63:30
about I don't even know what time it is
63:31
in the word this written they were the
63:34
word that we read all the time hopefully
63:36
I was fed it like baby food some things
63:42
he's talking about our spiritual places
63:45
or physical places some things he's
63:48
talking about our spiritual things or
63:50
physical things some our spiritual
63:53
activities some our physical activities
63:56
so you need discernment with all you're
64:00
asking for everything else why not
64:02
ask let's stand up and do it he said
64:04
make him do it you're gonna ask for
64:07
supernatural discernment it will open up
64:11
the word it will give you greater
64:13
understanding it's wonderful to sit in
64:15
here all this but wouldn't it be
64:17
wonderful if he just gave it to you
64:19
yourself because we're coming more aware
64:24
of the spiritual realm and this earth
64:27
itself would begin to focus on whole
64:31
lines of apparel the way they build
64:33
buildings even neighborhoods even
64:36
schools will be built because of the
64:38
spirit they follow or worship or
64:42
practice so we absolutely don't want to
64:47
be left behind the rest of the world
64:48
okay we have we should have a greater
64:51
understanding of spiritual things than
64:53
this secular world so we're gonna say
64:56
father I asked for and receive
65:03
supernatural discernment
65:05
and sound wisdom that I will bind to my
65:11
soul in Jesus name
65:15
I receive it amen amen
65:22
you can sit down one of the examples I'm
65:31
gonna kill people keep saying I am so
65:34
tired don't save tired but they know I
65:36
keep talking about the knot Flat Earth
65:38
theory okay
65:41
but seriously there's a whole group of
65:45
dedicated committed believers that think
65:53
they have absolute proof without
65:56
question that the world this earth is
65:59
flat because if the enemy can't get you
66:06
sucked into pure deception like freely
66:10
sin it's okay Jesus doesn't care or say
66:13
it's gonna be forgiven and he'll be back
66:15
up in heaven one day and and that's what
66:20
some people preach that I I know I know
66:23
people who were in those churches on
66:25
purpose for two years to see how far
66:26
they would go and so people will start
66:31
just talking about the love love above
66:33
above God love so much this is okay then
66:35
you know he loves you and read all the
66:37
scriptures that talk about love and only
66:38
love with no accountability they've even
66:40
made ho Bibles to only left lots of
66:43
stuff out so there's no accountability
66:46
now that is deception there's a little
66:48
bit difference confusion
66:51
misunderstanding of the spirit realm or
66:54
no understanding of the spirit realm and
66:56
spiritual places is really what the
66:59
whole Flat Earth is based on they don't
67:01
know but the spirit realm is they don't
67:04
or they wouldn't be saying that because
67:05
one of the scriptures they used to prove
67:07
the earth is flat is the Bible talks
67:09
about the four corners of the earth
67:13
north south east and west
67:19
but they don't think that means that
67:21
they are literally saying that the earth
67:24
has corners and another one they use is
67:28
it talks about the pillars of the earth
67:31
the earth is set on the pillars of the
67:33
earth that also is a spiritual thing
67:37
that's not talking about a physical
67:40
thing there are two angels over 2,000
67:45
miles high that God stood with the earth
67:48
like pillars until we needed them in the
67:52
very last days but they're picturing
67:55
pillars holding up this Flat Earth so it
68:00
holds it in place and I guess it doesn't
68:01
fall over or float somebody I don't know
68:03
about that one and there's a couple more
68:06
than use but but they're taking them not
68:08
only out of contacts there's spiritual
68:10
things that they're trying to say are
68:12
physical things because lack of
68:15
knowledge of the spiritual realm so how
68:20
many people know the earth is not flat
68:22
see amen please amen
68:27
I get emails all the time I go no it is
68:32
not
68:33
it says God sits upon the circle of the
68:38
earth so if it's a circle it can't have
68:42
corners it is a good point it's the word
68:50
then they don't know what to say well
68:53
that doesn't look didn't it that doesn't
68:55
literally mean it's round why don't you
68:59
go back to geometry class or maybe
69:02
kindergarden I'm not making fun of them
69:04
I'm being really serious because if
69:06
they're there if they are fiercely
69:09
forcing this upon people to believe this
69:11
then they should take seriously go back
69:15
and see what a circle is everybody say
69:18
it's round so that wipes out one whole
69:23
Scripture they use and why don't you
69:26
realize
69:28
north-south-east-west that goes like
69:30
this okay
69:32
nor I'm known doing wrong
69:33
north-south-east-west something like
69:37
that those are the four corners of the
69:40
earth it's actually a direction it's not
69:43
even something you can see so if the
69:47
earth was flat you would see had corners
69:49
and so none of that works out even in
69:53
your natural mind so I don't know where
69:55
their mind is but God help them all
69:58
remove the blinders so you don't waste
70:00
their time right now if he can't get you
70:04
into deception he will absolutely get
70:07
you into diversions and what happens is
70:10
you're going forward and all of a sudden
70:12
you get sidetracked you're not on his
70:14
path anymore that means you're not going
70:17
forward in the kingdom you're over here
70:19
like this by the way that's a circle I
70:23
got to stop doing that people go you're
70:27
being mean to the Flat Earth people know
70:29
I'm trying to bring some sense into them
70:31
or understanding that you're not
70:36
pursuing the right thing or you'd have
70:38
the right answers there are spiritual
70:41
places in the earth all over in the
70:44
earth and they don't see that they only
70:47
see this if a God says they see right
70:49
here it's what they see that's how far
70:52
they can see if all your head is just
70:55
man's head knowledge if you don't have
70:58
sound wisdom or understanding which is
71:02
knowledge of the Holy One if you're not
71:04
pursuing the spirit if you don't have
71:07
Holy Spirit invading you all the time
71:10
becoming your best friend getting in
71:13
your face sharing truth in the
71:14
scriptures showing you things to come
71:16
revealing the hidden things of God not
71:19
to flatter
71:23
I just can't even imagine I tell you
71:27
what happens not but you know how many
71:29
people think heaven is a flat place in
71:30
the sky he's and yet he framed the
71:34
worlds he framed the worlds okay and
71:38
they think when it talks about his house
71:40
it's a building you couldn't contain God
71:45
in a building first time he visited the
71:50
earth you set the mountains on fire by
71:52
walking past them you could hear him
71:54
walking from miles of and the terror of
71:57
God fell upon them because they realized
71:59
he's much bigger and greater than we
72:01
thought he was
72:03
he is our Papa he's not well he is our
72:10
spiritual Papa but literally we came
72:13
from him first we were in him we lived
72:16
in him he's passionate he's consumed
72:20
with passion and love for you so much
72:22
that it is turned to fire flames of fire
72:26
with passion that burns for you over the
72:30
stones of fire that pushes the rainbow
72:33
out of him if you put a light under
72:35
gemstones it shoots out a rainbow so the
72:39
father sits on the throne filled with
72:41
these massive gorgeously just almost
72:45
unspeakable with Beauty gemstones that
72:48
have blue fire flames burning up around
72:51
him inside of him and it pushes that
72:54
rainbow outside and it moves in and out
72:56
of him in waves like that and his eyes
73:00
are blue flames of fire that your father
73:08
who spoke everything into being every
73:12
single thing he wills that with his will
73:14
how important is your will your reals a
73:19
spiritual thing you can't reach in and
73:22
touch your will
73:23
you can't cut it out and show it to
73:24
somebody you can't cut your soul out and
73:27
show it to somebody your soul has a mind
73:32
it has the will and it has emotions
73:36
which are all of your actions and your
73:39
feelings that you display every day of
73:41
your life
73:42
those are still spiritual things so you
73:45
do have a lot of spiritual activity you
73:47
know that or to think that but it's
73:49
displayed in the natural realm and seen
73:51
in the natural realm but that comes from
73:54
your soul as a man thinketh in his heart
73:57
so is he that heart that word heart
74:01
means the core it doesn't mean your
74:04
human heart beating is that's a physical
74:06
thing and your soul is not a physical
74:09
thing it's a spiritual thing it can't
74:11
ever be separated from your spiritual
74:13
body you can't separate them okay so
74:17
your spirit man's affected by what your
74:20
soul gets fed your soul will affect
74:24
every part of your being it's at the
74:25
very core of your being in here very
74:27
core is your soul and what you let in
74:31
the eyes are the window to the so what
74:36
you watch goes into your what goes into
74:41
your soul you will think about you will
74:44
keep thinking until you choose it with
74:46
your will when you choose it with you
74:48
will you will then act it out so how
74:51
important is to guard your heart the
74:57
very core of your being guard it protect
74:59
your soul protect it from things you see
75:02
you hear you say you feed your soul all
75:05
day long that spiritual thing you're
75:07
feeding it
75:09
so that means spiritual beings are drawn
75:14
to what you are displaying from your
75:16
soul so if you feed your soul darkness
75:21
what are you going to attract yourself
75:24
if you feed it full of joy celebration
75:27
excitement creativity and life and hope
75:31
and joy what is going to be attracted to
75:35
it God's angels and God himself
75:41
so that's why this time is so important
75:45
why does he give revelation about the
75:47
soul which is a spiritual thing
75:49
manifests its sons and daughters of God
75:52
you have to walk free of the enemy
75:56
because God's not going to allow you or
75:59
give you power to do greater works or to
76:03
shake the earth itself speak to the
76:06
ground have crops come up purify the air
76:09
by speaking with his frequency from your
76:11
voice
76:12
stopping earthquakes and making them put
76:14
it back the way it was before he's not
76:16
gonna let people do that if they're
76:17
filled with darkness can you see that
76:19
because you can't take power over the
76:21
darkness if you are filled with it
76:25
because if it's in your heart you'll
76:27
think about it that means yes what you
76:30
won't your God it will really see her
76:34
it even talks about it being seared it
76:37
gets syrupy because you get too much of
76:39
the darkness in you say Amen this is
76:42
like this is why it's called boot camp
76:46
okay I know when my husband see boot
76:49
camp he didn't know he could do all the
76:50
stuff he could do so he came out he
76:51
learned different things he could do how
76:53
far he can make himself go I'm strong
76:55
could be the weapons he got and how we
76:57
could use them he is still a marine
76:59
trust me and that man looks so good so
77:09
spirit or spirit realm boot camp God had
77:15
me started he said you will be taken
77:16
everywhere this is the second place I
77:19
have taken it
77:22
Joan hunter on taxes heard about heavy
77:25
come at you there
77:26
they had so many people come in they
77:27
didn't know what to do with them and I
77:29
do know that I'm trying to think in the
77:32
natural now Chuck Pierce sent a whole
77:35
group of his women down to see what it
77:37
was all about he couldn't go so he sent
77:40
a whole coalition down I think like
77:43
there was a bunch of them to attend and
77:46
tomorrow when you come I have a handout
77:49
to give you which I almost never do when
77:52
you see things that are spiritual in the
77:54
physical realm you'll see portals
77:57
opening you'll see things coming out of
77:59
portals you'll see what some of that
78:02
spiritual highway looks like and I
78:05
didn't take them in heaven I took him on
78:08
the earth but the spirit realm was
78:11
opened you know God can reveal what he
78:13
wants to reveal amen he's revealing
78:16
himself more like he never has before
78:18
because we're like him we're supposed to
78:20
be like him right so I never had this
78:24
understanding about the soul but it made
78:26
me I understood why things happened
78:28
after I had the understanding what it
78:31
was and people trying to tell me oh no
78:33
the soul is just the mind it's just a
78:36
mind why do you tell people that other
78:37
stuff that's just gonna confuse them a
78:39
point
78:39
no the so is a spiritual thing and has
78:43
layers just like your body has layers
78:46
and your spirit man has layers because
78:49
God has layers in himself
78:51
Christ has layers and even Holy Spirit
78:53
as unlimited layers he takes a layer of
78:57
himself and sends it somewhere it's a
79:00
hole of him and that's how he knows
79:03
everything all at the same time
79:06
everywhere he sends a layer of himself
79:09
it's him it's not a copycat it's not
79:12
just a little shadow it's him that's how
79:15
he is he sends them wherever he wants to
79:18
when you invite you into and well you
79:20
he sends a layer of himself a hole of
79:23
himself to abide in you that's why
79:27
you're the temple a shadow wouldn't need
79:30
a temple but this is a hole be
79:34
God called Holy Spirit moving into you
79:38
and you have a hole of him he knows
79:42
everything about you all the time
79:43
everywhere you go but he knows
79:49
everything on the earth no matter where
79:51
it is what it is what's going on he
79:53
knows every single bit of it because he
79:54
has coated this artist with his layers
79:56
he just grabs one and sends it like that
80:00
your soul has layers your emotions are
80:06
the layers the more you have the more
80:08
expressed expressive the more creative
80:11
you are and some ethnic groups are more
80:14
expressive because they have more layers
80:15
in their soul and between those layers
80:19
you collect stuff that's where it gets
80:22
collected remember the eyes are winter
80:25
to the soul thing that's why you can
80:28
remember it where does your memory come
80:32
from it's your mind and you express what
80:36
you every time you remember something
80:37
that's not good
80:38
you're gonna get sad or oppressed or
80:42
upset and then me want you to think
80:45
about it over and over and over and over
80:48
and over - especially if you were
80:49
offended or somebody says that mugging
80:50
you he will replay that board all day
80:52
all night oh you go to sleep at wickham
80:53
oh you're still hearing it loose it from
80:57
your soul the word says cast all your
81:03
care upon Jesus because he cares for you
81:05
it's just a good way to cast it because
81:07
you're loosing it out of you and Jesus
81:10
is also the restorer of your soul you
81:14
know you don't know how many even I'm
81:15
saying how many times he talks about the
81:16
soul it's that important what does that
81:19
mean what you loose on earth out of your
81:22
soul he will come down and pull it out
81:25
because he's a restored your soul if he
81:27
pulls it out you have no memory of it
81:30
not addictions not pornography not abuse
81:37
he is showing us such depth of
81:40
understanding of how he put us together
81:42
the spiritual parts he's really
81:44
highlighting the spiritual parts you
81:46
know why so the physical
81:47
parts can be whole because even as your
81:52
soul prospers you your whole being will
81:58
prosper and live and that is one of the
82:01
few promises that promises you divine
82:04
health is tied to your soul your heart
82:07
the core of your being that's why we
82:10
have to have accountability say Amen
82:14
even in heaven the Angels head
82:18
accountability and when they didn't line
82:21
up guess what they went not to a good
82:24
place the woodshed for sure and it hurt
82:30
robot so he is he's showing you he's
82:35
actually dividing asunder it says in the
82:37
word that - it just sort of divides us
82:39
under what it's the spirit from the
82:44
flesh okay so you can live in the flesh
82:48
and be in the flesh which to be fleshly
82:51
mind it is who wants to be death if all
82:56
you think about in your natural head
82:58
that means your natural head with your
82:59
own rights your opinions and you're
83:01
gonna do it your way no matter when you
83:03
don't care what anybody says it's that
83:04
you get hurt or they just don't care
83:05
that your flesh your selfish flesh okay
83:10
you can't even see your flesh cuz I'm
83:13
not talking about this flesh I'm talking
83:16
about in your soul as a man thinketh in
83:21
his heart so is he
83:25
so to be spiritually minded is say life
83:30
that's why you need to know about the
83:32
spiritual things this is like
83:35
grade-school understanding the body
83:37
should have had a long time ago
83:43
your soul has to be engaged it has been
83:47
engaged to be powerful through Christ
83:49
because you let him have his will his
83:53
way you're surrendering your well to
83:57
have his ways
84:00
so if you surrender oil that means you
84:02
don't have the right to tell it what you
84:04
do that means your flesh that's in there
84:07
doesn't have the right to be in control
84:10
you can surrender you can surrender your
84:14
life to Christ you could be born again
84:16
you know you're going to heaven but you
84:18
can have so much flesh on you it's
84:20
ridiculous all you think about is you
84:23
what you want what you want to say you
84:25
know this is the only thing that's right
84:27
no it's always been this way we're gonna
84:29
do this way it doesn't matter what we
84:30
think God is saying or what you're what
84:32
you're discussing or anything we think
84:34
this is it so we're going this way
84:35
that's not surrender people go I have
84:40
rights and want didn't you lay them down
84:41
when you died with Christ because guess
84:44
what if you're a dead man
84:47
you don't have any rights if you're a
84:50
dead man Christ Christ can use you
84:53
really well but Satan can't use you at
84:55
all if you're dead you can't get
84:58
offended if you're dead to the flesh and
85:00
your selfish flesh if you're dead to
85:03
those ways those thoughts Satan can't
85:05
use you he can't win you offend you he
85:10
can't distract you deceive you that's
85:13
why it's important to die to your flesh
85:15
okay not this no greater loveth this
85:21
than a man lay down his life for another
85:22
is not talking about taking a bullet
85:26
it's about you surrendering your rights
85:30
your opinions instead of pushing
85:34
yourself on them and telling them
85:35
they're going to hell God hates them
85:37
because you think this is the right
85:38
thing to say no surrender your own words
85:41
and your thoughts let Christ put his in
85:43
you and bring them life and then they
85:46
want him
85:47
[Applause]
85:51
this is church this is training you to
85:56
do the work of the amazing powerful
85:59
supernatural new creation ministry
86:03
taking the gospel of the kingdom
86:05
carrying the glory around this world
86:08
amen
86:13
so I think I'm done with session 1 so
86:25
tomorrow when you come I will have these
86:29
manuals what do you want to call them
86:32
programs the Holy Spirit keeps calling a
86:34
program because heavens having a show
86:37
right now every show has a program say
86:42
Amen because that's what we're doing and
86:44
there'll be some really legalistic
86:46
people that don't like that because
86:49
their flesh is still in control if their
86:51
spirit man was engaged they would think
86:53
this was very exciting most exciting
86:54
news I've ever heard we get to put on a
86:56
show and manifest for God till we shock
87:00
this world in stunned hell that's the
87:03
show he wants us to do amen so before I
87:08
go I'm gonna declare some of you but I'm
87:10
gonna he told me to share one more thing
87:11
the first show that was put on was in
87:14
heaven and the father did that himself
87:17
he did not need any help from any angel
87:22
no Archangel not even the word not even
87:27
Holy Spirit he didn't need their help to
87:28
kick every single one of those out of
87:31
heaven because one of his weapons is
87:34
lightning the lightning power of God
87:38
destroys and unseats the works of
87:41
darkness it talks about in the word
87:43
thunders and lightnings coming from the
87:45
throne that's coming from him you see
87:49
these blue lightning bolts shooting
87:51
across the throne room and people run to
87:54
get hit by them it's a million megawatts
87:58
of love
88:00
and the thunderings many times are
88:04
actually his own voice because in the
88:09
word says his voice sounds like many
88:11
waters or many thunders because his
88:15
voice has layers when he made the angels
88:22
see he didn't birth them he didn't send
88:25
them from himself he just made them he
88:27
spoke and made them he's he spoke and
88:29
the word made them the proper way to say
88:30
is the father spoke he spoke a word and
88:34
the word made it that's why his name was
88:38
the word all spirit no flesh until the
88:44
day he decided to come down here and die
88:46
for us and he had flesh put on him the
88:49
second show was by his son when he show
88:58
him you know it says that God showed his
89:02
son his reward before he came here he
89:05
showed him his reward it was more than
89:08
one okay if you get rewarded for
89:09
sometimes this more than one thing one
89:12
of them is when someone comes home to
89:13
heaven he walks him personally up the
89:15
steps that throne gives him back to the
89:16
Father
89:17
that's one reward I know Heath they told
89:20
me that some a long time ago that he got
89:22
to do that so I know no matter which
89:25
family members living up there now they
89:27
met Jesus Christ at the gates and you
89:30
scored him up the steps they had a
89:31
celebration in the throne room the
89:33
greatest celebration ever the Father
89:35
which is out of the glory and held them
89:37
to himself and this is what they know I
89:40
came from here and when you meet the one
89:46
who sent you from himself that carried
89:49
you for eons of time loved you carried
89:53
you nurtured you spoke to you saying
89:55
over you wrote books about you made
89:58
plans for you he he's your father
90:03
was willing to send His only Son
90:07
what a sacrifice that's love that's love
90:11
and had that flesh put on him and then
90:14
the greatest there were two things that
90:17
really that he told me he suffered the
90:21
most about one was the cup he had to
90:23
drink a sinless perfect being to drink
90:27
all the sins of the world in the garden
90:30
of the cemani that was one of the
90:32
hardest things yet the other thing was
90:33
being separated from his father did not
90:36
hear him for those three days was in
90:41
hell Abraham's bosom first thing he
90:43
crossed over to hell by himself that was
90:44
something they'd never done before
90:46
because God was about to put the second
90:49
show on and Christ stood up on the third
90:53
day according to Colossians and spoiled
90:56
and ruined and crushed principalities
91:01
and powers so badly they cannot change
91:04
their image back after he was done with
91:07
them that was a second show the third
91:12
show is gonna be done during the kingdom
91:15
age by the greater works the signs and
91:19
wonders the generation that will be on
91:22
this earth that will live and and
91:25
experience the powers of the age to come
91:27
which is the Millennial age it will walk
91:29
in those same powers it lived to be
91:31
hundreds of years old like the people
91:33
who live on the earth one crisis on the
91:35
throne those people it'll be time for us
91:39
the vital Christ to put on the third
91:41
show and torment the demonic blind them
91:45
with the light of glory that comes from
91:47
us unseat them crushed
91:50
what they were doing you know take away

00:00
we ask that you would be glorified and
00:01
Lord as we honor cat in Jesus name Amen
00:06
let's give her a hand as she comes oh
00:08
very good very good
00:10
thank you lord thanks um thank you
00:20
I just got zapped by you that's upside
00:27
down that won't help me welcome
00:29
everybody can you hear me okay is this
00:32
okay
00:33
I get it a little bit closer is that
00:35
better okay and I have a gift look at
00:40
this little mousey
00:42
he is my laser because before I could
00:45
you could not really see you I don't
00:47
know if you can see that you may or may
00:49
not see it but whatever uh well the good
00:53
news is everyone should have your your
00:56
manual who doesn't have one is running
00:59
he does not have one of these and I
01:02
don't know if you have anymore but
01:03
there's a couple people raising their
01:04
hands raise your hand if you don't have
01:07
one just like this cuz you probably
01:11
already looked at it but we're gonna go
01:15
through it together and I've only done
01:18
this one other time but the people
01:20
didn't have it like until like right at
01:22
the very very end of anything I've never
01:25
done anything like this before but God's
01:27
always make me do new things he would
01:29
not let me create a syllabus and he said
01:32
do not ever call what you do a
01:33
conference he said we need encounters in
01:37
this time so our conferences everyone
01:41
out there all you pastors leaders start
01:43
calling it an encounter name it what you
01:46
want to but call it an encounter
01:48
we need encounters with a living God we
01:51
don't need another conference to get
01:52
head knowledge we need our God to invade
01:56
us amen
01:57
he actually called this a program he
02:01
said you're not gonna do a syllabus
02:02
which is like this thick we read it go
02:04
through it scripture by scripture then
02:06
put it in a closet somewhere I used to
02:08
do that and so this is actually got
02:11
pictures because God is all about images
02:15
manifesting and demonstrating for God is
02:19
showing his image and his power so in
02:23
this time on the earth
02:25
one of the main Commission's I have
02:27
besides revealing heaven is to reveal
02:30
the spirit realm so we know what he
02:34
means when he talks about the spirit and
02:35
the flesh in the Bible many scriptures
02:38
talked about that those are usually
02:40
things concerning your soul the way you
02:43
react respond or what you're saying of
02:45
what you're doing is either in the flesh
02:47
or in the spirit and we all know what
02:50
the word says to be spiritually minded
02:52
is life to be fleshly minded is death
02:56
that means you're not producing anything
02:58
that anybody needs uses or wants and so
03:02
more and more he wants us to walk in the
03:04
spirit learn the ways of the Spirit
03:06
operate with the Holy Spirit be more
03:09
spiritually minded than flesh means your
03:13
human mind your human reactions your
03:16
human understanding he wants you more
03:18
and more to understand in the spirit
03:20
then you can walk in the spirit because
03:23
then you have life in you and coming
03:25
from you and so one of the most things
03:27
lacking in the body of Christ is an
03:30
understanding of what is the spirit
03:33
realm because that's where you came from
03:35
that's what we operate in all your
03:38
authority your declarations your decrees
03:40
even your prayers you've been praying
03:42
aren't about this physical realm you're
03:45
releasing them into the spiritual realm
03:47
they go up to heaven which is a
03:49
spiritual world and they were responded
03:52
by spiritual beings by the host by
03:55
Gabriel's angels whatever the respondent
03:58
in the spiritual manner that impact the
04:00
physical realm so most people understand
04:04
while I'm praying this is a spiritual
04:06
thing I'm doing but most all their other
04:08
activities
04:09
they don't think of it as being
04:11
important to understand the ways of the
04:13
Spirit and what the spirit run around me
04:15
so if you were here last night
04:17
you really if you weren't here last
04:20
night you really seriously need to get
04:23
that that tape you need to get it
04:25
because I talked about how we operate
04:28
the spirit where in the Bible is talking
04:31
about things that represents just
04:33
scriptures
04:34
they're talking about the spirit realm
04:36
or spiritual places and spiritual
04:38
activities that people think that's
04:40
talking about the physical realm and so
04:42
there's scriptures in the Bible
04:43
connected to the spirit and when it's
04:45
collected to this physical connected to
04:47
this physical realm and we have to
04:49
understand if we're going to rightly
04:51
divide the word then you need to know
04:54
which ones he's talking about because it
04:57
changes your life and so that was the
04:59
first night and I've never actually done
05:01
that ever before in a meeting I usually
05:04
would strictly talk about the spirit
05:06
realm and start talking about what it
05:07
looked like what went on there some of
05:09
the beings that were there how we will
05:12
this world is becoming more and more
05:13
spiritually minded I'm talking about
05:15
even the secular world when I say
05:17
secular I'm talking about the ones that
05:19
are not believers I know we could call
05:22
them the lost the unsaved the wicked the
05:25
the nicest term you can use a secular
05:27
okay there's the there's the believers
05:30
about it Christ then all the rest the
05:31
world is the secular world not connected
05:34
to God not knowing God and they need to
05:36
know him everyone came from him that
05:40
ever came and existed on this earth they
05:42
all came from him and that's why he said
05:45
he wants the vilest sinner set free
05:49
there's only one unpardonable sin that
05:53
means it can never be pardoned so even
05:56
the vilest sins you see happening in
05:58
this world today no matter how horrible
06:00
they are they can be forgiven if people
06:03
sincerely ask to be forgiven and repent
06:06
for them the one thing that can never be
06:08
forgiven is if you had a relationship
06:11
with God like Lucifer did Lucifer was
06:15
not Satan he became Satan he chose to
06:19
birth iniquity from himself it was found
06:22
in
06:23
him certainly wasn't anywhere in heaven
06:25
nor in God knowing the word nor in Holy
06:27
Spirit it was birth and and I've talked
06:30
a whole lot my 80th 81st meeting I think
06:36
and this climate is very dry I'm I'm
06:43
from Florida we get a free spa treatment
06:45
women every time you step outside and
06:48
you have 100% humidity so we don't
06:50
wrinkle easily okay our skin is always
06:53
soft unless we go up north and then it
06:56
feels like sand so there is benefits to
07:00
being in 100 humidity atmosphere people
07:03
pay a lot of money for that okay we get
07:05
it for free just living there so I go
07:08
back home and get my spa treatment but
07:13
more and more God wants you to know who
07:16
he is as your true father why he calls
07:21
you his sons and daughters why he
07:24
welcomes you home
07:25
not as someone's husband or wife or
07:27
mother but he welcomes you home as his
07:30
sons and daughters because he bursts him
07:33
births all of us from himself we lived
07:36
in him I talked a lot about that last
07:38
night and when I was just in Canada I
07:40
was in Saskatchewan Canada or it ended
07:43
up by being seven meetings instead of
07:45
like four and this place had never heard
07:47
of me before they sat there stunned and
07:50
undone and there was one person I'm
07:53
telling you descent one person in the
07:54
last meeting I had planned to speak
07:56
about something that was heaven culture
07:58
and he said there's one person here I've
08:00
got to change their mindset about me so
08:03
you're gonna do something different you
08:04
never done and I went I showed the whole
08:06
big picture started with heaven was just
08:11
heaven and when God began to create
08:13
things in heaven he created the Angels
08:15
how we did that all the way to us living
08:18
in him the whole time he was doing this
08:20
he's been from the beginning to the end
08:21
the end at the beginning and the whole
08:23
time we were in him before he made the
08:25
earth we lived in him and so we were we
08:29
were used to going places with him we we
08:31
could see and understand who he was and
08:33
then that was taken away from us when he
08:35
sent us
08:36
himself he actually made a time space
08:38
planet so that he could send us to have
08:41
a body you had a little spiritual body
08:44
of light you were made out of light and
08:46
that's in them and by the way the food
08:48
in heaven is all made out of light
08:50
you eat all you want to there's no
08:52
weight gain no food allergies I'm just
08:54
gonna put that there for free people
08:56
celebrate they worship they eat they
08:58
fellowship they worship they eat they
09:01
eat they fellowship they worship they go
09:03
on tours of heaven they do all kind of
09:05
wild fun things and they eat everywhere
09:07
they go
09:10
Jesus has a sweet tooth if you got one
09:14
blame it on him so there's just a few
09:19
things about about heaven but right now
09:22
I'm gonna be talking about heaven on
09:24
this earth and how we are actually being
09:27
connected to it it is invading at an
09:30
accelerated rate that means the ways of
09:33
heaven the things that are in heaven
09:35
even things they wear certain things
09:39
they say you're gonna hear new words
09:41
released I release them all the time
09:43
about the way they talk in heaven and
09:45
places they visit those things are being
09:47
created on the earth
09:48
and that's not a mistake that's a that's
09:50
happening now because if heaven this is
09:54
if it's gonna be on earth as it is in
09:57
heaven
09:58
that means we're going to have things
10:00
similar to what's in heaven created on
10:03
the earth new inventions and ideas are
10:07
coming that will actually change your
10:09
entire life the way we live even the
10:12
cost of us living is going to change
10:13
because of these new inventions and then
10:16
we will be doing some things on earth
10:18
just like they do in heaven like
10:20
painting with light painting with light
10:23
like houses cars a hair will be done
10:26
with light color not like chemicals and
10:29
you know put enough foils in your here
10:31
you could contact Mars every woman knows
10:34
what I'm talking about if you've ever
10:36
had your hair done it's going to make it
10:38
simpler because in heaven they live this
10:42
amazing life filled with Wonder splendor
10:45
and the greatest technology ever
10:48
is in heaven and especially with
10:51
Holograms they do a lot of things with
10:53
Holograms only it's not just light it's
10:55
actual beings and you go to actual
10:58
places in Holograms with Holograms it's
11:01
really a way of life it's heaven culture
11:04
so one of the greatest technologies you
11:07
see on the earth will be done in
11:08
computers and other systems and ways and
11:10
things that we get to enjoy and do will
11:13
be done through Holograms and you'll see
11:16
more and more of those invented and put
11:18
out there it's gonna be amazing why do I
11:20
want to escape during the greatest times
11:22
on the earth and that means if this is
11:25
going to happen things have to improve
11:27
in almost every arena of our life like
11:31
wickedness and darkness we push back in
11:33
regions where they do that on purpose
11:35
but in many regions of light and glory
11:38
and safety that will be created on the
11:41
earth that we will live in and so a
11:44
whole different change we've already
11:46
been shifted onto God's timeline and he
11:49
has his own time he goes by not man's
11:51
say amen
11:53
most of you won't even be here during
11:56
the perilous times or the tribulation
11:58
that is an extremely short period of
12:01
time and God still has to have us carry
12:03
the glory first of all learn how to
12:05
carry yet what it is how it operates and
12:08
then the knowledge of it being carried
12:10
around this world many times over
12:12
shaking the world and stunning hell that
12:15
hasn't happened the fire has not
12:18
happened the baptism and Fire has not
12:20
happened in mass and it will happen it
12:23
will come in waves from heaven and the
12:25
angelic are a part of that baptism and
12:27
fire I'll show you in the word it says
12:29
his angels make his ministers flames of
12:33
just like in the upper room so that
12:36
hasn't happened in case you're wondering
12:38
the wealth of the wicked and I was
12:40
actually gonna have us all stand up and
12:41
open the vault
12:45
you're already concerned you already
12:48
consumed in the atmosphere of heaven in
12:50
this room and so many prophetic things
12:52
and words and visions and things will
12:54
come to you just sitting there just tell
12:56
open your hand say God I want it
12:58
I literally was gonna have us date up
13:01
and open the vaults that have been
13:03
holding back this is the time for this
13:06
great well to begin to because people
13:08
are running after God's time and they
13:11
realized beginning to realize who they
13:13
are we shouldn't be held back for any
13:15
reason because in heaven because there's
13:18
no sin there's no sin in heaven there's
13:21
no evil in heaven so when it's not a
13:23
part of you when Christ's children said
13:25
there's none of him in me he meant the
13:28
enemy he meant the devil and he lived as
13:30
a man in this world with the devil not
13:32
in him had more fun wreaked havoc to the
13:35
religious hierarchy of his day and broke
13:38
all the kind of laws and traditions to
13:40
show them this is the now time of God
13:42
right then it was a now time for Christ
13:44
to be walking on the earth than when he
13:46
made everything demonstrated manifests
13:49
the power of God that he actually was
13:51
over time now under time over the
13:54
weather not under the weather that he
13:56
could accelerate propel in time he could
13:58
hold time still he did all these things
14:00
walking as a righteous man that's why
14:04
they causing the son of man he had to be
14:09
just like us although inside he was
14:11
still God he couldn't use his God powers
14:14
he had to actually accumulate and walk
14:17
in righteousness pursue every level God
14:20
revealed to him on the earth he had to
14:22
choose with his will every day of his
14:24
life to say yes to what the father was
14:27
asking him to do that's why he that's
14:30
why he got to the point where it didn't
14:31
matter where he walked life came and he
14:35
spoke life wherever he went and that he
14:38
didn't mind judging the leadership of
14:41
that day that was lying to the people
14:43
burdening the people stealing from the
14:46
people and they didn't like him because
14:48
he was a great threat to the way they
14:51
lived their life which was going to
14:53
change so this is the time of change
14:56
again change has come to the earth again
14:58
you're not waiting on it because you're
15:01
hearing these words live in heaven
15:02
culture that's on earth as it is in
15:05
heaven take power over the enemy engage
15:08
with the hosts of heaven heaven is a
15:10
weapon
15:11
bash the enemy you always wanted to hit
15:12
him anyway right with the only way
15:14
you're physically literally going to do
15:16
that is to sip the host of heaven on
15:18
every demonic being that's anywhere
15:20
around you and they will crush them bash
15:23
them literally I I have seen acts of war
15:27
between the army of light and army of
15:29
darkness and army of darkness always
15:31
loses they actually lose parts of their
15:37
being you can't kill them but they get
15:39
marred and scarred because there's no
15:41
life in the darkness they can't get
15:43
healed and yes the army of heaven
15:47
sometimes they get kind of beat up they
15:49
get worn and all their warring but
15:51
there's always healing refreshing for
15:53
them they get to go back to heaven and
15:55
play take a break and then be sent back
15:58
here to war on your behalf and they're
16:01
out there for you all the time and when
16:06
you when you pray or when you command
16:08
this is the time to come and people go I
16:11
don't like that
16:12
did Christ command you better say yes
16:15
did he command the hosts of heaven did
16:21
he heal the sick did he not tolerate one
16:25
demon around him was he ever attacked by
16:28
demons did he multiply the food so that
16:33
many was never hungry he wasn't poor he
16:37
had a treasure to carry his money he
16:39
paid for the upkeep in the food of all
16:41
the men that were with him sometimes
16:43
bought food for everyone who came to
16:45
hear him which was thousands of people
16:47
he had homes
16:50
he had wealthy friends he even had
16:53
sinners that liked him because he did
16:55
really good ethical excellent contracts
16:59
for carpentry you ever wonder what he
17:03
set with sinners they were business
17:05
connections
17:06
he took the gospel through the business
17:09
world of that day and so did Paul Paul
17:15
made fabrics work with fabrics made
17:17
tents made banners he was a businessman
17:20
even Peter was a fisherman he was a
17:23
businessman
17:23
Luke was a physician he was a
17:25
businessman if you just go on down the
17:28
line God use business people they
17:32
already have ethics they understand
17:34
protocol they understand you know
17:36
honoring those in authority it was much
17:38
easier for him to use business people
17:40
than just people religious that's why
17:45
you're hearing things about the
17:46
marketplace the marketplace ministry
17:48
that's what Jesus did he had a
17:50
marketplace ministry when he was on the
17:53
earth a master carpenter who was sought
17:56
out because of his gift and he was
17:59
remembered and so was Joseph so get
18:01
ready to be in business it's going to
18:06
begin to happen God's gonna give you
18:07
witty ideas and inventions or connect
18:09
you to people that you have a part of
18:11
that business that they need he's gonna
18:12
bring people together for that and he's
18:14
even gonna connect and I said this when
18:16
I was here the last time he's gonna
18:18
bring Orthodox Jewish businessmen and
18:20
partner them with believers in business
18:24
and that is already happening it's
18:28
already happening you're this is this
18:31
world is changing and people who want to
18:34
hide because I think it's the end aren't
18:36
even gonna be a part of it and guess who
18:39
he's calling to be a part of it us those
18:44
who follow him you know it's nice to be
18:47
a fan of something but why not follow
18:50
follow means you're running after what
18:52
he's got and you want to act just like
18:54
him and people didn't like it when I
18:57
started saying take authority over the
18:59
weather teaching them how to deal with
19:01
the hurricanes and tsunamis the fires
19:02
and let me tell you what rains went and
19:05
put out a lot of those fighters when we
19:07
told it to and that one hurricane got
19:10
beat up so bad it didn't know what it
19:11
was doing and I'm from Florida and no
19:15
matter what they showed you on the news
19:18
it was not that bad because their own
19:24
words were saying how horrific is that
19:26
it would be it would be debt it would be
19:27
like death to people if you stayed you
19:30
would die that people were leaving like
19:32
by the millions I didn't go anywhere
19:36
because I'm over the weather not under
19:39
the weather and we even changed the
19:41
course of that hurricane because it was
19:44
drought on the on the west side of
19:46
Florida there was a lot of drought the
19:48
farmers if there things would have never
19:50
gone to market if they didn't get the
19:52
rain they needed on their orchards and
19:54
their other products of produce they
19:56
were making and so we actually told it
19:58
not to go off to the right we sent over
20:00
to the left of Florida and mainly up the
20:03
center to the west - and it soaked all
20:05
of that and they were saying Tampa will
20:07
be wiped out the city be wiped out and
20:09
never even touched Tampa and yet the
20:12
Weather Channel was there trying to say
20:14
try to show devastation and people saw
20:17
them mocking it some of the things they
20:21
show them from past hurricanes I'm just
20:23
letting you know then they tried to show
20:27
Jackson was one the worst hit I'm
20:28
telling you I live there we had some
20:32
tree limbs come down the three areas
20:34
that flooded always flood downtown
20:38
there's an overpass if you drive through
20:40
a rainstorm you want your cars going to
20:42
be under water so it always floods see
20:44
and Marco I worked there you'd walk
20:46
through water up to your knees just from
20:47
a rain storm so they had flooding in
20:49
those areas on Black Creek if you if you
20:52
want to live there you should have your
20:53
house on stilts about 10 feet high
20:55
because that Creek always overflows its
20:58
banks and the waters receded and people
21:01
did I'm not saying that wasn't some
21:02
damage but there was not death and
21:04
destruction like they forecast and some
21:07
of those videos that were showing what
21:08
from past events someone who lives in
21:12
Kissimmee they saw them mocking what
21:15
showing people how horrible it was and
21:17
it wasn't they lived there and they
21:19
actually I think it was Roy fields was
21:21
telling people it wasn't as bad as they
21:23
said some of the lights went out but hey
21:25
we're used to that when thunderstorm
21:27
comes and my and my house was not even
21:30
touched we had a few pine calls hit pine
21:32
pine cones hit the roof that was it
21:36
and mainly what happens is when arranged
21:38
well hard the trees get heavy so they
21:40
fall on a power line and then it puts
21:43
everybody's lights out they go remove
21:44
the tree hook it back up and his fix so
21:46
it was not anything like they had said
21:49
it was going to be because the body of
21:50
Christ for the first time came together
21:52
as weather warriors and they were we are
21:56
over the weather because Christ stopped
21:58
the storm and when he woke up he look at
22:01
the disciples like what's wrong with you
22:04
he'd actually taught them that what is
22:06
wrong with you why did you wake me up he
22:09
expected them to stop it so this is
22:12
something we're supposed to walk in it
22:14
is our right as a believer we are over
22:17
the weather we are over the earth we are
22:20
over not under amen and so he's actually
22:25
starting a move called the weather
22:26
warriors and there'll be people who are
22:30
Watchmen that will spot everything going
22:32
on they will alert all the weather
22:33
warriors that begin to bash it take
22:35
authority over it and you're gonna see
22:37
the weather begin to change around the
22:38
world because that Devils been driving
22:41
it and powering it and riding in it to
22:43
bring death and destruction if we're
22:46
over all the power of the enemy that
22:49
doesn't mean leave the storms out or the
22:53
fires or the droughts you're right and
22:58
we really haven't just living our life
23:01
letting it go on we're just giving all
23:04
that authority than anything mean to run
23:05
over some beat us up kill steal and
23:07
destroy
23:07
and yet Jesus came to bring life and
23:10
bring it more so start living abundant
23:13
life so I'm glad he opened the bolts and
23:16
that seriously happened because that was
23:18
something God said you was gonna happen
23:20
tonight so I thought I would be doing
23:21
that but nope it was pastor
23:23
so everybody's hold your hands up and
23:26
say I receive the world
23:28
bring it on we are over it not
23:33
controlled by it amen
23:38
make sure you receive that word amen so
23:46
so I'm gonna share a show a few things
23:49
we'll actually share a few things I
23:51
almost never talk about products I
23:53
forget I have them and yet when I go and
23:56
share I'm sharing from these things I
23:58
already have produced and put out there
23:59
this is one of my newest ones it's
24:02
called culture of honor that's how we're
24:04
supposed to honor each other on the
24:05
earth how we honor people from the past
24:08
and then it takes you to heaven how how
24:10
they honor people in heaven by the way
24:14
they live their life on the earth how
24:15
even the hierarchy of heaven the Father
24:17
Son and Holy Spirit is honored by the
24:19
angelic and how they honor each other
24:22
this is heaven culture the honor of
24:25
culture is one of the main things that
24:26
you will see when you go to heaven or
24:28
your chapter you're caught up there amen
24:30
and so that's it this other one I talked
24:33
about look at last night born again this
24:36
is not just telling you receive Christ
24:39
you get born again you're a new creation
24:41
get a Bible start reading it and go to
24:44
church although I I'm saying all those
24:46
aren't important to be connected to
24:48
those who believe in operate in the now
24:51
time of God not that the others aren't
24:54
important but in that time when God used
24:57
that he is now using the body of Christ
25:00
corporately to actually get out there
25:03
and do the work of the ministry by
25:04
demonstrating how to live heaven culture
25:07
on this earth it's not a hard assignment
25:10
trust me
25:11
and so this is called born again from
25:13
the moment you say yes to Christ what
25:16
happened in the spirit realm what
25:18
happened inside your entire spiritual
25:21
being what happened in heaven what
25:23
happened in eternity what happened in
25:25
hell this is going to tell you exactly
25:27
what happened what what you get depart
25:30
deposited into you by the by the son by
25:32
the father by the Holy Spirit what
25:34
happens in the Lamb's Book of Life what
25:38
does that look like what is your future
25:40
then look like
25:42
what not to fall back into you how to
25:45
order your life now that you are a
25:47
believer and a follow of Jesus Christ
25:49
the traps of the enemy operations of the
25:52
spirit realm I'm telling you this is it
25:54
right here for people they say give it
25:57
to them the other student they're not
25:58
ever gonna fall back into the enemies on
26:00
they'll never lose their seat that's
26:02
been established for them I'm not saying
26:06
that they may not go to heaven I'm just
26:07
saying they won't be powerful they won't
26:08
be successful they need to have an
26:10
understanding from the moment they're
26:12
safe what happened and this talks to
26:14
them about the spirit operating in the
26:16
spirit how their spiritual being how
26:18
they are a living soul what to do with
26:20
their soul how to loose things from
26:21
their soul if they're getting if they
26:23
encounter things after the born-again
26:24
it's very it's a little tiny single CD
26:26
it is a powerful witnessing tool and we
26:29
actually was recorded this at this
26:32
church with his pastor lay down his life
26:34
got got kicked up by the Baptist he's
26:37
got the Holy Spirit and it's called new
26:40
new freedom its new freedom fellowship
26:43
in a little Oklahoma Missouri that has
26:46
one blinking traffic light and the sign
26:50
says the little town where big things
26:52
happen and so we actually recorded and
26:56
dedicated to his memory he has now in
26:58
heaven reaping all his rewards but it's
27:01
powerful is God said I'm gonna finally
27:03
reveal what happens when you're born
27:04
again you know what the new creation
27:07
revealing of the Kings this is the
27:08
spiritual Kings that he is king over he
27:13
is a king of spiritual kings those are
27:16
levels of authority and Dominion that we
27:19
can go after in this time those are
27:21
eternal positions not temporal the Bible
27:25
says we are kings and priests unto our
27:27
Lord those are spiritual positions for a
27:30
spiritual Lord who is a spiritual
27:31
Kingdom is powerful male or female Kings
27:35
[Music]
27:37
male or females there are no Queens and
27:42
people go what about that if the guys
27:44
the guys if you can be part of the Bride
27:49
of Christ do you
27:51
it really what realized as a spiritual
27:53
position I hope you say yes so in the
27:57
spirits you can be a Bride of Christ
27:59
with your male or female say Amen so in
28:03
the spirit realm you can be a king with
28:06
your male or female it's levels of
28:08
authority and Dominion you are taking
28:11
yourself that take you to those very
28:13
high levels of authority priests lords
28:16
and kings are eternal positions and this
28:20
is a really powerful CD and it talks
28:22
about and it gives you scriptures of
28:24
course everything gives you scriptures
28:26
and then this one is really funny this
28:28
is called superheroes there I am in a
28:30
superhero costume
28:31
yes I've worn one and spoken it before I
28:35
don't wear the spandex okay you won't be
28:40
seeing that but I have what I call
28:43
superhero blue I do have an outfit I
28:48
wear it and the Holy Spirit makes me
28:49
wear it especially I do it in healing
28:51
rooms for some reason that's Ryan de Bie
28:53
wearing it
28:54
Santa Maria healing room I think this is
28:57
where this was taped and it's a double
28:58
one because they just let me go they
29:00
didn't care how long I went and I did
29:01
not know that the pastor who's a great
29:04
character behind me was showing scenes
29:07
of The Avengers Superman Batman all of
29:14
those other superheroes and I actually
29:15
talked about and this is very
29:16
fascinating it talks about why the world
29:19
is wild over them why do they seek after
29:22
somebody who can help rescue be a role
29:25
model for people that they bring hope
29:28
and a future to people's lives why do
29:31
they run after that how Christ is our
29:33
own superhero but how we now become
29:36
heaven superheroes it's very focused
29:40
it's very good and the first time I ever
29:42
went back and we and recorded parts of
29:44
it you couldn't hear clearly
29:46
we spent a lot of time making this so
29:47
this is real powerful you are having
29:49
superheroes and they're all cheering us
29:51
on amen so that's that's the end of
29:54
those there you go
29:59
yes you may give it to him so that was
30:09
my little commercial amen I've told
30:14
people it is one of the best witnessing
30:16
tools you can give anybody give it to
30:20
him they will want to belong to Jesus
30:23
Christ it shows him in all his power all
30:26
his glory the sacrifice he made by
30:29
changing his image from the word to the
30:32
Son of God what he literally gave up to
30:35
do that we know what he did on the earth
30:37
but you don't know what he gave up in
30:38
heaven that he had flush put on him for
30:41
the first time I will always have that
30:43
flesh through all of eternity because it
30:46
was to become acquainted with us and and
30:48
he would be acquainted with our
30:50
sufferings and our trials and it changed
30:53
him even when he did that and made him
30:55
love us more even living amongst us when
30:58
they were rejecting him he forgave us
31:00
for that but it really showed who he was
31:02
as the word where it talks about him
31:04
being in the word how we work together
31:06
with the father step in the father he
31:08
would go somewhere the father would
31:09
speak what he wanted and the word
31:11
stepped out and made it and then it
31:14
takes you to the Scriptures world jesus
31:16
said you and me and me and you I mean
31:17
there's so much evidence of the word of
31:21
Christ what he gave up for us and what
31:24
he meant when he was saying those things
31:26
when he was on the earth of course
31:29
that's talking about something spiritual
31:31
again when you go home to heaven you
31:33
step in the Father Holy Spirit steps in
31:35
Jesus steps in and we are all one
31:37
together and anyway so but we're gonna
31:41
talk about spirit realm boot camp right
31:43
now and at the end if at all possible on
31:46
living hands on every person in here
31:48
[Music]
31:50
and I'm gonna lay hands on you and
31:53
impart unto you revelation for operating
31:57
in the spirit realm
31:58
I've never done it before I've released
32:02
the life of God I've read I have
32:05
released the life of God I've released a
32:07
lightning power of God I've released all
32:11
kinds of things into people but never
32:12
this so this is new this is new and this
32:16
is gonna become like a movement spirit
32:18
around boot camp and people actually be
32:20
able to come get trained and go get
32:21
these managers and go do it yourself
32:23
okay I can't go everywhere and so at one
32:27
time I'll actually will have a an event
32:29
where we what we do training like
32:32
training with everybody specifically to
32:34
train you how to share this and you
32:36
already know it's gonna include living
32:38
heaven culturing men and how many people
32:41
have never heard me before can I see
32:42
your hands
32:43
a few people Wow well this is a new time
32:48
on earth and I am living heaven culture
32:49
right now you're seeing heaven culture
32:51
on my head
32:52
heaven is one of the most beautiful
32:54
places
32:56
God gave me a commission I didn't ask
32:58
for the Commission I personally pursued
33:01
I got born again at 4 out of 65 and I'm
33:05
getting younger because Christ is the
33:09
restorer of our youth so if all you're
33:13
talking about is becoming old you will
33:15
be you actually have me tell people and
33:20
your words are powerful your words got
33:24
you where you are right now where you
33:27
are right now in your life your words
33:29
did that even though people may have
33:32
been involved people came against you
33:34
they did things to you maybe not even
33:35
maybe even horrible things but your
33:38
words what you're saying right now about
33:39
yourself what you think about yourself
33:41
what people are saying about you you
33:43
don't have to accept any of that you
33:45
accept what God has said about you
33:47
you're wonderfully and perfectly made
33:48
you came from him he is your father he
33:51
made everything that was ever made he
33:53
has great plans for you he doesn't have
33:55
bad plans for you he sings over you he
33:58
wants you to have deep beautif
34:00
sleep sweet sleep he'll give you sweet
34:02
dreams if you ask for them whatever you
34:05
ask for from him he will give it to you
34:07
so get up and ask for sound wisdom
34:09
supernatural discernment excitement
34:13
expectation celebration you know God
34:16
carries that it's in him all the time or
34:19
he couldn't create if you were sad even
34:24
just sadness will stop you from being
34:26
who God wants you to be if you walk
34:29
around sad and you don't know why don't
34:30
keep it in there something happened you
34:34
50 years ago stopped letting it make you
34:36
sad loose it out of your soul because
34:39
whatever is in there you're gonna think
34:40
about an enemy we'll make sure he
34:42
replays every bad thing you did those
34:47
images are in you you loose them out of
34:49
your soul it's like they were never
34:51
there and the next time I go back and
34:54
speak in a men's prison I'm gonna teach
34:56
every one of them how to do that I they
34:59
will loose every crime they ever
35:01
committed the crime won't be in them
35:03
when they get out they will never go
35:06
back to crime prison is a good example
35:11
of a soul that's all messed up and they
35:13
don't know what to do with it they don't
35:15
even realizing that are helping to keep
35:17
themself in that in that situation in
35:20
position if you've been in poverty a
35:22
long time it's probably because you've
35:24
been saying all along we don't have
35:25
anything we never will we can't do that
35:27
we can't buy that we can't have that
35:29
guess what you're doing you're stealing
35:31
those works you are you shall eat the
35:35
fruit of your lips as a man thinketh
35:37
inside himself so is he and the more you
35:41
say that you begin to believe it and the
35:43
more you believe it you live it so let's
35:45
change the way we've been living our
35:47
life and start saying things that God
35:50
says about us I before I knew any of
35:53
this stuff I get up in the morning I'm
35:54
gonna start saying what God said about
35:56
me and every time I said it I said I
35:58
would feel more powerful in him and he
36:01
would open up his self and reveal more
36:03
of him to me because I was actually
36:05
saying I believed he existed we don't
36:08
have any problem talking about things
36:10
all around us going on you see
36:12
but you know what it's not seeing as
36:14
believing believing is seeing what you
36:17
begin to believe you will see in your
36:20
spirit man and said that's not even in
36:24
the Bible calling those things that be
36:27
not as though they were yes it is if you
36:32
want change start saying what you want
36:36
changed and then say and I'm willing to
36:39
be obedient to change anything you want
36:41
me to change and then he'll begin to
36:43
give you a list I lived every single bit
36:47
of this I'm sharing with you I lived
36:48
every bit of it I I had to go through
36:51
this I had to actually see that this was
36:53
truth it was in the word I just believed
36:56
what it said and one day the more this
36:59
is if you don't even trust God if you
37:02
don't trust people because the things
37:03
that happen to you loose all the junk
37:05
all the abuse all the negative words
37:07
hateful defiling words all the profane
37:10
things that you've heard or said or seen
37:12
loose it and get out of your soul buying
37:15
the love of God if you just start
37:17
without yourself to bind the love of God
37:19
and the presence of God to your soul and
37:21
then just start saying God I don't want
37:23
to live this way anymore I want my
37:25
family to prosper I want my soul to
37:27
prosper I'm gonna be just like you you
37:32
can't remember anything just get before
37:33
God say I want to be just like you guess
37:37
what that's what he wants you're
37:39
actually agreeing with him he sent you
37:42
here to represent him and to be like him
37:44
it's in the word let us make man in our
37:47
image and after our likeness but we
37:51
walked through this world like well this
37:52
is my lot no he didn't give you that lot
37:56
man may have the enemy certainly was a
37:58
part of that but that's not what God had
38:00
plan for you
38:01
those things he wrote in that book about
38:03
you for he sent you was all the great
38:05
things he had for you these are my
38:07
purposes my plans this is what I've sent
38:09
you to do this is what I've called you
38:10
to you and yet we listen to a man says
38:13
all the time or the arts and
38:16
entertainment media which pretty much
38:19
75% of everything they put up there's
38:20
bad
38:22
say man you feel yourself with that
38:25
you're gonna think about it any man you
38:29
can have a good time enjoy your life and
38:32
have fun you just need to be aware of
38:34
what is not good for you and what it
38:36
would is very good for you amen
38:38
and I speak to the Hollywood the movie
38:41
industry all the time I've already put
38:43
them on notice they don't stop putting
38:45
the darkness out there they're gonna
38:46
bomb and they're gonna lose all their
38:47
money I've even talked to him about them
38:50
the habitation of God coming to the
38:53
earth I don't care what they think they
38:56
need to know truth too because when they
38:58
see it happening guess what they're
38:59
gonna know my gosh is what she's talking
39:00
about
39:00
it really is happening people aren't
39:03
coming to these movies we better tweet
39:04
them they make a perfectly good movie
39:08
then they put like 12 profane horrible
39:10
words in there they have to put one or
39:13
two scenes that aren't good at all to
39:15
make them get either pg-13 or R rating
39:19
even though they can clearly look at the
39:22
history of Hollywood and see the five
39:25
top grossing movies of all time
39:30
RG and PG movies so why don't they want
39:34
to make them because if they make them
39:36
that means you can bring your family
39:37
that means more people but they're
39:40
because their minds are seared and they
39:42
live in darkness what they produce is
39:45
darkness they almost can't help what
39:47
they're putting out of them because if
39:48
it's in you that's what you will express
39:50
how much what you will write and that's
39:52
what you will you know give out to
39:54
everyone to see so they need to get
39:57
saved or at least be aware even though
40:01
you may think the world lives like this
40:04
they don't all live like that even the
40:08
part that's not Christians there's still
40:09
a good moral majority in this nation
40:14
that doesn't want all that junk
40:16
and they've already already five of
40:18
their top movies they put out have
40:19
bombed and they've lost millions but the
40:22
other ones that are just simple people
40:24
can't stop going to them because they
40:26
can take their families their friends
40:28
and if you want to take it up a notch
40:30
then you can go look at that stuff I
40:32
don't take you up a notch it takes you
40:34
down
40:35
unless you're following Satan then I
40:38
know where you will end up and you won't
40:41
like those that you won't like what you
40:43
get there they're not just no breakfast
40:46
in hell there's no life in hell there's
40:53
a song that says that there's a song
40:54
does anybody remember who wrote this
40:56
song and my the Newsboys in the father's
41:01
house or something like that it's called
41:02
yeah and he actually they say that
41:05
there's no breakfast in hell and what
41:08
man they got that right do you know the
41:12
noise boys I was a Christian group and
41:15
they were ahead of their time but their
41:17
songs it was awesome so yes I could go
41:21
into a lot of different things right now
41:22
but I want to go ahead and and talk
41:25
about the spirit realm boot camp and and
41:28
so if you got you if you got your little
41:30
thing just hold it up and let's look at
41:31
it and I will tell you this your natural
41:35
mind may not understand much of this but
41:39
your spirit man will really pull it in
41:43
your spirit man will be so excited that
41:46
your spirit man is being fed and today
41:48
they're getting a cafeteria including
41:50
dessert getting the whole meal including
41:54
dessert the creature on the front of
41:57
this is not a cloud this is a spiritual
42:01
being I didn't cover that part but
42:04
spiritual beings some of them appear
42:07
transparent some of them are filled with
42:10
light and glory this one certainly is
42:12
filled with light and glory and if you
42:16
look it's a profile at standing like
42:18
this and it's got its hand like this can
42:20
you see that right under its chin it's
42:23
hand is literally like this and it has
42:26
one big eye do you see yet in that eye
42:29
there's only half of a lens because the
42:32
other part records
42:36
you can actually see your face in the
42:38
eye if my mine I can but there's
42:42
actually a face and this is this this
42:46
fear this this angels name I actually
42:49
set a host the hosts are made well the
42:53
angels are made in drops okay their
42:56
maintenance ribes the first tribes
42:58
weren't the American you know Indians
43:01
they weren't the Jews they were the
43:03
Angels when God created angels he
43:06
created tribes of angels and some of
43:09
those tribes were put under Michael some
43:11
were put under Gabriel and then the one
43:13
whole group that was worship angels were
43:15
put under Lucifer and by the way the
43:18
only ones he got were the ones that were
43:22
under him Lucifer did not get one host
43:26
of heaven from Michael he didn't get one
43:28
single one of Gabriel's
43:30
none of them would believe the lies that
43:32
he was telling they just wouldn't
43:34
believe them they knew who God was so
43:37
and he puts marks on angels
43:40
so marking belongs to God there you go
43:44
and Leviticus in the original scriptures
43:47
that weren't have been translated fifty
43:50
times and people in today's language
43:52
have made a couple that say don't put
43:54
tattoos on you and that's not what was
43:57
said this was about the culture of the
43:59
day okay it says do not mark yourself
44:01
with the marks of the dead and I can
44:07
just tell you what's coming to the body
44:08
not just hair color in Psalms you should
44:13
read all of them
44:14
and there's a scripture in Psalms that
44:16
says some will worship me and song some
44:18
and dance and some will put my marks on
44:20
them in this time I happen to know I've
44:24
got some of my own children they got has
44:26
had them creep marks and put them on
44:28
them that represent him they're young
44:31
people on fire for him and they don't
44:34
mind sharing with any single person or
44:36
individual no matter how wicked how
44:39
dangerous how you know no matter what
44:41
they got tattoos piercings everywhere it
44:43
doesn't matter they will start sharing
44:45
about the kingdom of heaven
44:47
and what time it is and that they came
44:49
from the very heart of God and lived in
44:51
him and they will listen to them they
44:56
listen to me because I have pink hair
44:58
that's not even a threatening color okay
45:01
little piggies and little babies are
45:03
pink they're harmless it's also used on
45:10
Valentine's Day is one of the colors
45:12
that represents love
45:14
I didn't pick my air color I didn't even
45:16
choose to cholera had orders from
45:20
headquarters because I would be speaking
45:24
to the world and tweaking the body of
45:26
Christ this is heaven culture if you
45:30
made the rainbow why wouldn't they wear
45:32
in heaven amen
45:34
so this is a being one of one of the
45:37
hosts of heaven and which is all tribes
45:42
of angels these these there's more than
45:44
one of these angels as a whole tribe
45:45
named Scout this is a scout I'm gonna
45:50
you're gonna hear me talk in some
45:51
military terms because I mostly talk
45:54
about the army of heaven and it talks
45:57
about them through all the word even how
45:59
they physically fought on behalf of
46:01
Israel I think and if I'm correct Frick
46:05
was it true that one angel slayed 85
46:08
thousand a hundred and eighty five
46:11
thousand I'm so sorry guy whichever one
46:14
you are up there one angel slayed a
46:18
hundred eighty-five thousand astral
46:20
people wicked army was coming against
46:23
because people now mostly in this day
46:28
they attacked the spiritual army of
46:31
darkness we all know that there is a
46:33
devil I hope you know there was a real
46:35
devil some people now are saying there's
46:36
there were never was a Satan there's
46:38
people like him that's called deception
46:42
there is a real devil Christ wasted him
46:46
on hell and the third day he was kicked
46:49
out of heaven his name used to be
46:50
Lucifer it talks about him all over in
46:54
the Bible I don't know how they get
46:55
around that they probably leave those
46:56
scriptures out but there's a real devil
46:58
he hasn't
47:00
me all the Angels that were kicked out
47:02
of heaven with him had become so defiled
47:05
it changed their features Satan is not
47:09
creating demons he cannot create life
47:11
and give life to anything he just can't
47:16
do it he only can kill steal and destroy
47:18
so all those Angels he reserved a few so
47:22
they wouldn't look to file but they are
47:24
that can appear to people that's why you
47:26
need to know how to test any angel that
47:28
shows up to you and says come and go
47:30
with me you say are you of the Spirit of
47:33
the Most High God who sent his son to
47:35
die for the sins of this world and I may
47:37
tell you if they are not they will
47:39
either say nothing to you or they will
47:41
disappear and then you evict him out of
47:43
your room but whatever you do don't go
47:47
with them and people are saying yes
47:49
because they want to have an encounter
47:50
and it's fine if you want to have an
47:53
encounter and there are many angels
47:54
right now who are sent to catch people
47:56
up to heaven but you need to test them
47:59
how many people got that say Amen it
48:03
will happen eventually because more and
48:05
more are present on the earth more and
48:07
more people are having true encounters
48:09
in heaven or true encounters with God's
48:12
angels and because that happens the
48:14
devil has to mock something to bring
48:17
confusion to people he even did that in
48:20
the past so that's why you need an
48:23
understanding of the spirit round both
48:24
sides are out there they're always
48:27
active a lot more activity out there in
48:29
the unseen round than the seen round and
48:31
in this day we need to know and be
48:34
empowered and empowers you when you know
48:36
this it's not - but fear in you is to
48:39
make you fierce against the enemy people
48:42
it doesn't say that yes it does it says
48:44
the violent take up by force
48:46
spiritual violence rising up in you that
48:49
having causes and encourages for you to
48:52
come and come against the army use your
48:53
weapons pull down strongholds /
48:55
platforms bash those demons get them
48:58
thrown in or dry place
49:00
it's called pushing back darkness if we
49:04
have power over all the part of the
49:06
enemy no matter where they're operating
49:07
what they're doing how they're doing it
49:11
when they're doing it you
49:12
you as a believer have power full power
49:15
over them
49:17
that doesn't mean hide in your closet
49:20
unless that's your encounter room and he
49:26
more in this more nor than ever before
49:29
because of more spiritual things coming
49:32
to light in the earth and people having
49:34
encounters you need to know who you're
49:37
having an encounter with and in when
49:41
you're when you have that understanding
49:43
you are empowered that means you have
49:45
the right to say yes or no to them just
49:47
because they come up and say come on
49:49
doesn't mean you have to go okay now if
49:52
Jesus comes in person and he wants to
49:56
take you who take you anyway which has
50:01
happened to me the whole time I'm
50:03
starting to ask him he'll say why are
50:04
you asking me you know who I am gonna go
50:08
kid never mind but even I test him
50:12
sometimes if I haven't seen him or know
50:14
of them before a lots of times God will
50:16
say I'm gonna send an angel this is what
50:17
his name is this is what he's gonna be
50:19
bringing you a message for me this is
50:21
what he'll be talking about I'm like he
50:23
could just give it to me his health but
50:25
he's letting me experience encounters
50:28
and the angelic are here to help us okay
50:31
the ones that blow unto God care about
50:33
you very much they've been given
50:35
assignments to keep you in all your ways
50:36
defend you protect you even that your
50:39
foot there will be a time when your foot
50:41
can't even be dashed against a rock I
50:43
mean you won't be hurt or harmed this is
50:48
what Heaven culture is taking you to
50:51
because it doesn't happen in heaven say
50:54
on earth as it is in heaven so Thursday
51:00
from all harm all accusations
51:02
there's no offense there's no anger no
51:05
violence of any kind whatsoever no fear
51:09
whatsoever everyone cares about you they
51:13
like you they want to know you they
51:15
invite you over all the time they want
51:17
to go on tours with you that you you'll
51:19
know and more and more the deep things
51:21
of God's this place you can go through
51:23
the chamber of underst
51:25
which is where you meet with the father
51:26
one-on-one in heaven every believer but
51:30
next to their mansion has a garden with
51:32
a key that Christ gives you himself and
51:34
I've seen people where all the time when
51:36
you go in there he comes to see you no
51:38
matter how often you go in there Christ
51:40
will come and see you so yes they want
51:43
to know you and spend time with you
51:45
it is a different way of life but we
51:47
don't have to wait to die and heaven you
51:50
exist to live down here we've pretty
51:53
much been existing so if we're living on
51:56
notice that they do in heaven that means
51:57
we will exist now to live not be crushed
52:03
and broken and left abandoned because
52:07
even if I used to tell people if I lost
52:09
everybody and everything I ever had and
52:12
I just stood on a street corner with
52:13
just me I would have everything because
52:17
Jesus Christ I live in him he lives in
52:20
me I know him I know his heart
52:22
I know his ways I know his plans why
52:25
would I fear anything because he is on
52:27
my side this is what he meant when that
52:30
scripture said why should I fear when
52:32
God is on my side we need to live like
52:38
this you celebrate all the time and if
52:43
things are happening around you you
52:44
change them you take power over the
52:47
enemy don't wait for him to show up at
52:49
your door you start taking it before
52:51
anything happens
52:53
those hosts will guard and protect you
52:55
they'll keep things from you from
52:57
happening to you they'll go in the
53:00
traffic they'll move the traffic out of
53:01
your way they're going the turbulence on
53:03
the plane and move the turbulence away
53:05
from you they'll give you favor with
53:07
every airport person in customs and
53:09
security at check-in in the restaurant
53:14
you'll have favor in heaven they live
53:20
like that so if we're living heaven
53:23
culture then we get those benefits we
53:26
don't even have to die in our body to
53:28
enjoy it
53:30
but we have been calling it in our
53:34
father who is in heaven holy is your
53:37
name now this is the part where you have
53:39
to really start looking at the scripture
53:41
in like parts okay we have identified
53:44
that we're talking about the father say
53:46
the father Jesus said there's none good
53:50
but the father and he loves the father
53:55
he wants us to know the father
53:58
we came from him we're his offspring so
54:01
you have just identified who you are
54:03
saying this to in other words you're not
54:06
saying these words to Jesus Christ who
54:08
is our Savior who is our King right
54:11
we're talking and Jesus said to say this
54:14
didn't he
54:15
so if this is something Jesus said to
54:17
pray he was bushwhacking every Christian
54:20
to do something that would call in a
54:23
whole age on this earth people go the
54:27
kingdom ages and anyone in the Bible
54:29
quote the scripture with me you've just
54:33
identified you were talking to the
54:34
father okay that is his world his home
54:38
in my father's that is a world called
54:43
heaven are many mansions in that
54:48
scripture you're identifying again whose
54:50
house are we moving to the father's
54:53
house so you are now talking to the
54:56
father whom who has his house is the
54:59
world called heaven and you're giving
55:01
him an invitation our Father who is in
55:06
heaven holy be your name your kingdom of
55:12
heaven come what does that look like
55:15
your will being done on earth just like
55:20
it is in heaven that's a whole culture
55:25
you're not talking about the culture of
55:28
this world right now you're saying I
55:30
want a whole new culture I want to live
55:33
on earth like they live in heaven that
55:35
is what you said and I'm be the glory
55:38
you know we we have been talking to him
55:41
for years and inviting him to come
55:44
to bring the kingdom age there will be
55:46
the kingdom operating on this earth in
55:50
our lives seen in us around us us being
55:53
blessed by it
55:54
not being attacked not being sick our
55:57
souls prospering handling the wealth of
56:00
the wicked being above in every area of
56:03
society of government of Education in
56:06
the news media in arts and entertainment
56:08
all of it to medical arena all of it
56:12
because in heaven everyone excels their
56:16
gifts are operating at the greatest
56:17
level they create they invent and they
56:20
celebrate all the time wouldn't you like
56:25
to live that way on earth as it is in
56:29
heaven
56:30
so people say well you can't do that you
56:32
just looking to go on earth as it is in
56:34
heaven
56:36
so we have entered into that time
56:39
resurrection morning 2012 we stepped off
56:44
a threshold of time and stepped in a
56:46
whole new age on the earth God measures
56:50
time by events so when an event that's
56:55
been going on is full a fullness of time
56:58
comes
56:58
sometimes it takes into a new season of
57:01
our life or something new God's doing
57:04
but when it's time for a whole new age
57:06
to come on the earth that is huge
57:10
because when a new age comes to life
57:12
drastically changes and many new things
57:17
come and a new season you experience new
57:19
things
57:20
you see God doing new things but in a
57:22
whole new age they got it designed for
57:25
us to opera in to be known in this time
57:27
as manifested sons and daughters that
57:29
means it's going to drastically change
57:31
so that's the time you're in we're not
57:34
waiting on it it's here you have to say
57:37
yes so this back to this being in I
57:41
don't know if you you you can't see the
57:43
picture between screen anyway I already
57:46
told you that you can clearly see that I
57:48
anyway it records the activities of Hell
57:51
and then you know God doesn't have to do
57:53
any of this but he loves to be involved
57:55
in our lives
57:56
he loves to engage
57:57
the angels and to doing things for him
58:00
because they have something to do and
58:02
that's gonna make something that will
58:04
happen to us or infect us in some way so
58:07
this is one of heavens of one of the
58:09
tribes called Scouts this angels name is
58:11
scout the Holy Spirit told me and you
58:14
can see the glory all over it I mean
58:15
it's just good like the glory running up
58:17
and down if I can get it on the screen
58:18
oh are you
58:20
I used to battery dying anyway Wow all
58:22
the way up here you can see the light
58:24
all over in this being and and he hides
58:27
well in the clouds and then me look at
58:29
that and they go well that's nothing
58:31
because the enemy's brain is not as
58:33
intelligent as the hosts of heaven
58:35
because when they fell they lost some of
58:38
their intelligence they don't know
58:41
everything all at the same time they
58:43
don't even know really God's plans for
58:45
us but when the time comes for us to
58:47
start manifesting they know there's a
58:48
new time and therefore they increase
58:51
their activity but it's not gonna do any
58:53
good
58:54
because of who you are what God is doing
58:56
with us right now so listen listen if
58:58
you can come to if you can look at the
59:01
next one I don't know if we can actually
59:03
see that and I don't know if it if you
59:05
found did you find the unseen realm say
59:10
yes if you can find where I have the
59:14
portals and there see I have files I
59:18
have probably over a hundred pictures of
59:20
angelic and you can tell that it's a
59:24
creature and I continue the thing about
59:28
Gabriel's angels he's over most all of
59:32
them look like us they look like a human
59:34
most of the army don't look anything
59:37
like us they have some kind of a body
59:40
they have arms and legs sometimes some
59:43
are just huge massive eyes with like
59:45
facets in them and they have wings on
59:48
those eyes that go around and record my
59:50
eyes go to and fro on the earth isn't
59:53
just God looking it's eyes that are part
59:55
of the host that he's sending to record
59:57
things yeah this is this is a real
60:00
portal that this one is I'm Tara member
60:04
where this one is this is Kansas
60:10
you can see some of the faces they look
60:13
kind of scary kind of if I had to call
60:15
it scary right across from this marker
60:16
do you see that head it's huge it's like
60:19
it's huge it's right to the left of this
60:22
on the corner you see it looks very
60:25
fierce right how many people can see it
60:28
say Amen okay that is one of the hosts
60:31
of heaven you can see the eyes right eye
60:36
sockets right below that you see his
60:38
mouth kind of open mm-hmm
60:40
yeah yeah it's right like the portal
60:43
open portal looks like a heart see that
60:45
yeah and you see eyes looking down from
60:48
inside at the very bottom kind of to the
60:51
left you see two eyes those creatures
60:53
haven't come this is a portal an open
60:55
portal to heaven and normally it looks
60:57
like it has part of the rainbow around
60:58
them this is not the Sun this is an open
61:02
portal a true portal into heaven and
61:04
these creatures are coming out to fight
61:07
to go to war and there's one on the two
61:10
i'ma say on this side also to the far
61:14
right you'll see a face right here it
61:16
looks like a lion kind of like a lion
61:18
face well that there's one that looks
61:20
like the moon you'd be surprised how
61:22
many of the hosts actually have a head
61:24
like the moon like a crescent and so
61:28
these creatures I know it's makes a
61:30
little bit harder that I can't show you
61:31
I'm talking about at the top where the
61:33
arch of the hearts are there are lion
61:36
faces they have like pink outline to
61:38
them they're not really big at the top
61:40
of that but I just mainly wanted you to
61:42
notice the portal we're gonna look at a
61:44
couple portals that thing has passed
61:46
through these are creatures of heavens
61:48
army coming in to go to war and so
61:51
that's called an open heaven and when
61:54
Christ come into the heavens to open an
61:57
open portal happened and I'm just
62:00
letting you know he did that as a
62:02
righteous man he said many times I come
62:06
in the heavens to open because he was
62:09
say commanding everybody say Christ was
62:12
commanding
62:14
say God said Khomeini me that didn't
62:21
mean he was telling you to tell him what
62:22
to do that meant you were saying what
62:25
was gonna happen if we're ruling
62:30
remember if we're ruling we command
62:34
that's declaring and decree what you
62:38
declare and decree that's not you saying
62:41
God I want you to do this when you're
62:42
declaring decrees going to happen I will
62:45
be free I will walk in the light of God
62:48
I will be a carrier of his wealth I will
62:51
carry the glory I will do what Christ
62:53
did and greater works you're declaring
62:56
something that's not asking say not
62:59
asking commanding it's important if you
63:04
rule your kings and priests into your
63:07
God we have the right to command because
63:09
Christ did and what he commanded was
63:11
always what God wanted because you know
63:13
him so these portals open whenever God
63:17
sometimes just does it sometimes when
63:20
things new anointings new Mantle's right
63:22
now these portals are opening releasing
63:24
wealth because we declared it it's
63:28
already happening so let's go to another
63:30
one if you have another one who this I
63:34
showed it a long time ago I used to have
63:36
these prints with me and this is a being
63:38
looking down like this and that light is
63:41
the top part of his head you see a
63:44
mustache and a beard and dark like dark
63:47
hair all above him like up there at the
63:48
top his forehead there's one eye there's
63:51
his nose can you see it say Amen
63:53
how many people can't ask me your eyes
63:58
to be open do that portal you just saw
64:05
never might judge you there were lines
64:07
at the top of it looking in well well
64:10
let me see these little small things you
64:12
see right above here all those are Lions
64:16
that came in there is a whole tribe
64:19
there's a huge Lions head
64:21
right to the left of this thing there's
64:24
two eyes here his muzzle right here
64:27
right underneath here this is the hair
64:30
see the see right under here see the
64:32
dark hair you see the dark clouds below
64:36
this from here to here there's dark
64:39
clouds that is this beings hair you're
64:42
looking at who's looking down like this
64:45
so you're looking at the top of his head
64:47
can you see it now then you see a
64:50
rainbow around his face like right here
64:52
around his face you see that rainbow
64:55
that's where the portal was and then
64:57
right at the butt of that one part you
64:59
see his nose a mustache and a beard he
65:02
looks sort of like Jesus if you had that
65:05
up right it would look like Jesus it's
65:08
it's not Jesus though he is a guardian
65:12
he's a guardian over the state of
65:14
Florida and that wasn't Kansas that
65:17
portal was the one in here is Kansas
65:19
this one but if you look at your paper
65:22
does that look like a heart do you see
65:25
the rainbow kind of around it yeah see
65:28
that's a different that's that's a real
65:29
portal in Kansas but it looked very
65:31
similar to the one you saw up there that
65:33
look like a heart with the colored light
65:35
around it and so right below where his
65:39
head is if you look right below you see
65:42
the face of that line that's looking
65:44
full out so the so up here underneath
65:49
here this from here to here is that
65:52
being the top of his head's up here
65:55
that's where his hair is right below us
65:57
here is his forehead with the colored
65:58
light running around his whole face like
66:01
that that's his I blow here in the
66:04
middle of that light is his eye and then
66:06
below that is his nose and it's all
66:08
looking down so that is uh this is the
66:11
guardian angel every state has a
66:12
guardian angel and below that his head
66:16
is this huge line that came in with him
66:19
and down down underneath here right
66:21
above are all those small faces if you
66:25
could blow that up those are all small
66:27
lines and some of those were the ones
66:28
looking in at the top of the portal so
66:31
let's go to the next one
66:33
and all these things came that you're
66:36
gonna see it came through the portal and
66:38
the next picture is probably here you go
66:40
that being you just saw looking down
66:43
picked his head up turned it and blew
66:45
the breath of God out of his mouth and
66:47
the very center of the picture well
66:50
right underneath this thing is the Lions
66:53
Eye you see the pupil see the round
66:57
pupil okay so this is something if I
67:00
think there's what the lines I
67:02
underneath here underneath here is the
67:04
other Lions Eye then you see his muzzle
67:08
at the end of his muzzle is that angels
67:12
head you see the whole head you see the
67:14
forehead the eye sockets the nose you
67:17
see that light that bright light in the
67:19
middle is the breath of God he's got his
67:21
mouth open you can see his chin under
67:23
that how many people see that let me see
67:25
your hands this is a real encounter and
67:31
all the women on my staff we were all
67:34
going to a women's conference at one of
67:36
our friends places in Fort Lauderdale
67:38
and about part of the way down this
67:40
whole encounter happened and and we got
67:42
these pictures so yeah so that's the
67:44
same being you saw with the dark hair
67:46
you even see the place right underneath
67:49
here you see like it's kind of punched
67:51
in cuz he picked his head up and turned
67:54
it and he's blowing the breath of God
67:56
out of his mouth and there's other
67:59
beings and there's so many I'm not gonna
68:01
compliment so this is this came from
68:03
that one open heaven at four o'clock in
68:05
the afternoon in Florida is not dark and
68:08
so and the Sun wasn't even on that side
68:11
it was over on the east this is looking
68:13
towards the west close to floor so let's
68:16
go do another one this is not the same
68:20
being but this is a being that came
68:22
through at the same time and if I
68:25
outlined it from here is his head with a
68:28
count he's looking forward like this his
68:31
face is like a crescent this bright
68:34
light you see like let me get this right
68:37
underneath here is his eye and then you
68:40
see his cheekbone which has got a lot of
68:42
bright light on it okay
68:45
can you see it so you're looking at a
68:49
profile again you see his head looks
68:52
like a crown on it like this his eye
68:55
which is really big and his nose is
68:57
sticking out from there and then his
68:59
chin with his beard you can see him in
69:03
his chest underneath his head or eyes
69:05
like up above this part you see almost
69:09
like eyes in the middle of his chest up
69:12
about this part this this angels name is
69:16
Zoey he has eyes in his chest like here
69:20
are you giving me a pointer oh I don't
69:25
mind doing it well you already know
69:30
where it is
69:30
okay you need a step stool okay okay
69:37
where is where's this beard did you know
69:40
that's not his beard you can't reach it
69:47
alright why don't you point to his chest
69:49
that has all the eyes in it let me have
69:53
the pointer just no no no no no no no no
69:57
show you this part I'll be out be back
70:00
on the camera in a minute okay this part
70:03
right here our eyes in this chest you
70:06
can see the eyes you can see blue eyes
70:08
all this is like this zigzag her eyes in
70:11
his body okay over here actually is the
70:15
head of a big lion his eyes his nose
70:18
this is a huge lion that's with his
70:20
creature okay in this creature I'll be
70:23
careful at the cords okay this arched
70:26
part right up here is his head the crown
70:28
of his head he has a crown on that is
70:31
his cheekbone that's all bright white
70:33
see it there's his eye
70:36
this is his cheekbone that's his chin
70:38
with his beer right there and what he's
70:41
going into looks like a bunch of peacock
70:43
feathers you see the colors that is
70:46
called the dark glory it talks about God
70:49
hiding himself in dark clouds of glory
70:51
all of this part looks like all on the
70:54
left edge he's going into that glory
70:58
it's coming down over his face that's
70:59
white part of us over his nose and and
71:02
on his face this creatures going back up
71:05
into heaven through the dark glory and
71:07
they groomed the living creatures
71:09
there's you some new news that's
71:11
actually what there's a whole tribe and
71:13
I knew this but I didn't know an ancient
71:16
Hebrew writings it actually talks about
71:18
the Zoe that groomed the living
71:21
creatures who don't know who the living
71:24
creatures are read revelation 4 well it
71:28
talks about the living creatures the
71:29
four creatures around the throne of God
71:31
that cry out they have eyes in their
71:34
bodies and in their wings this creature
71:37
was created to groom them and I thought
71:43
what I used to see when I looked at it
71:45
was I thought it was the head of an
71:46
eagle it looks sort of like an eagle and
71:48
God had me going to zoom in I literally
71:50
standing here can see those blue eyes in
71:52
his chest and so that's what he does
71:56
that I can see the big lion head and
71:59
this is what this appeared in the
72:00
physical realm so we were seeing the the
72:04
spirit realm exposed in the physical
72:06
realm
72:07
and you see all that green and blue to
72:09
the left that's the dark clouds that God
72:12
hides in the south man let's see if
72:15
there's there may not be one more in
72:17
that series are you looking at the host
72:18
or the unseen the host okay I don't know
72:23
if there would be another one in there
72:24
or not is that the last one he's
72:28
outlined
72:30
I did it because so many people kept
72:34
saying I can't see him can you see him
72:36
now
72:37
everybody should say yes that is what
72:43
you're looking at and I outlined it
72:45
because people kept saying I can't see
72:47
it so this plate it's a plate that you
72:51
see that has like the zig zags on the
72:53
end all those are living eyes in his
72:55
body and that's his face right there
72:59
there's his beard he had this covering
73:01
on his head but he had a crown on him
73:03
and and so he's going back up into the
73:06
dark glory and if you go back to the
73:09
other one now you'll actually be able to
73:10
see him you see him now that's why I
73:17
outlined on your page whatever page
73:20
that's on you see at the bottom that is
73:29
a different one but still the same thing
73:32
I could see them clearly but it was so
73:34
amazed me yeah it helps to have them
73:41
outline because then when you look in
73:45
the sky you're gonna go WOW okay it
73:48
doesn't have to look like a human face
73:50
with human clothes wearing them when you
73:54
look up in the sky sometimes you'll just
73:56
see layers of eyes rows of eyes because
74:00
the army when it comes to fight they can
74:02
layer spiritual beings like 50 could
74:05
stand where I'm standing because they're
74:07
layered beings they're spiritual beings
74:10
so anyway I didn't even know about that
74:12
for several months and the hoster said
74:14
you go back and look at that you're not
74:16
seeing it yourself
74:17
so I actually zoomed in on it and I went
74:19
I got someone done I'm like this is
74:22
amazing and the reason why I know their
74:25
names and what they do is because the
74:27
Holy Spirit told me so I don't know if
74:30
so you didn't find the one that said the
74:32
unseen realm okay there you go now he's
74:37
on your paper can you see him better
74:44
this is not a cloud people call them
74:49
clouds this is a real literal spiritual
74:52
being they look kind of transparent
74:55
looking they don't have like a body like
74:58
ours like this if you ever hugged an
75:01
angel it would feel like hugging straw
75:05
if you ever hug one and it really when
75:09
you hug them even when people go to
75:10
heaven if they hug them it feels like
75:12
it's it feels like they kind of give
75:14
even the powerful ones it feels like
75:16
they're not made out of straw
75:18
they have real bodies they use their
75:20
arms and legs and that this one looks
75:22
like a lion and his name is Rex he's
75:26
part of the Royal Guard a tribe of
75:28
angels that all look like lions and
75:30
they're sent to guard the Kings the
75:32
priests and the lords and people have
75:35
said I see lines in the sky everywhere
75:37
because in there and there and then
75:40
their wings come from their neck
75:41
you see his wings when he goes up that
75:44
when one goes the other way he also has
75:48
eyes in his bodies got one by his mouth
75:50
there's an eye he actually has two eyes
75:53
here right here he's got a flat nose
75:55
like a lion and underneath his long
75:58
moustache she's got long mustache and
76:00
his hand is further down he's holding a
76:02
scroll in his hand like that it's a
76:05
living scroll to life
76:07
and it's name is justice because justice
76:09
is coming to divide of Christ
76:13
he was assigned to earth during this
76:17
kingdom time and he actually is the head
76:20
of the army I command he also had orders
76:24
in that scroll for me to command that
76:27
scroll was sent by the father and from
76:32
that time on when I got back home he
76:34
said you have to invite the Royal Guard
76:36
to come and be your weapon to put on
76:38
strongholds for you I I didn't I didn't
76:41
just hear these words he actually showed
76:43
me the being that would be the head of
76:46
the army so I started with a hundred I
76:48
have a billion you know why I send them
76:52
places they don't want to be bored okay
76:55
if you come in an army you better be
76:57
sending them all the time and you better
77:00
give them commands if you wake up in the
77:02
middle of night go outside and give them
77:03
one
77:04
like today from my hotel room they were
77:07
waiting when I open those curtains I
77:09
knew they'd be waiting and I had told
77:11
them that I was going to send them into
77:12
Denver to put on every stronghold of
77:15
Pharmacia of marijuana the misuse of it
77:19
and they were gathered so I couldn't
77:22
even see the end of them they were
77:23
always just waiting and so when I just
77:28
said I take power over all the part of
77:30
the enemy working with and empowering
77:33
the use of marijuana the lies of
77:36
marijuana the destruction it brings it
77:39
takes you out of your natural mind it is
77:41
not good for you no matter what they say
77:43
I lived in the 60s I saw what it did it
77:47
actually did ruin people's lives it
77:49
caused so many accidents from people
77:51
doing that and then driving and it
77:53
doesn't do good no matter what they say
77:55
it's just not good it talks about not
77:58
using that in the Bible it talks about
78:00
our not having anything to do with the
78:02
necromancerr which is witchcraft is in
78:05
the Bible and so I sent them to pull
78:07
down and be strong expose every illegal
78:11
especially the illegal use and I even
78:14
told them you go expose every person
78:17
group or place that is illegally used
78:21
that stuff and then it said they make it
78:25
clearly known expose what it really
78:27
represents take the blinders off the
78:29
eyes of the people I sent them to Denver
78:31
from here and because they're really
78:36
making it look like it's a good thing
78:37
it's not a good thing and the police
78:40
won't tell you they don't know how to
78:41
handle it but they don't even know what
78:43
to do with it because their shops
78:44
everywhere and when they say fresh green
78:47
they're not talking about salad and
78:49
they're every they're everywhere cuz I
78:52
just went through there and so I told
78:54
them I and I'll and I mean one second
78:56
later looked in the sky was just nothing
78:59
because they had left they left
79:02
instantly want to sent them so I expect
79:04
things that start happening and I don't
79:11
know if you have got is there another
79:13
one after that that's a close-up so you
79:16
can see his face can you see his
79:20
mustache oh they'll go see out again you
79:23
can see almost like fur or hair on him
79:25
and you actually can clearly see the two
79:28
eyes he's got two eyes he actually has
79:30
eyes along the side of his face right
79:32
here like those little groups of things
79:34
their eyes I know we think they have to
79:37
be uniform like we're going to have eyes
79:40
on a creature no there could be like a
79:41
whole mass here and then some here and
79:43
they can see no matter where they turn
79:45
their head they can see that that what
79:47
the enemy is doing around them and you
79:50
see that deep okay you see the deep dark
79:52
blue in front of that angel and then
79:55
what Rex is the one that looks like a
79:58
lion if you go back there real quick
80:00
you'll see a rift you see a rift that is
80:04
not the natural world you're looking at
80:07
through that rift that is what he came
80:09
in out of and so usually if there's a
80:13
it's still a portal it's just a
80:15
different kind of a portal and he came
80:17
in from there and then although all the
80:19
rest of the sky was like a light blue if
80:21
you can go back to the other one you'll
80:22
see light blue around
80:24
there's some kind of a light-blue off to
80:26
the far left corner that was the natural
80:28
sky but that deep blue around him is him
80:30
coming in I actually have pictures of
80:33
him my husband was with me goes
80:34
something was coming in over there he's
80:37
Scottish she's got five layers in his
80:39
soul so he doesn't get excited about
80:41
anything but fishing and he goes oh
80:43
something's coming in over five storeys
80:46
of condos this creature was bigger than
80:49
those five storeys of condos and he came
80:51
in flat and you could see him flat when
80:54
they come in from the spirit realm the
80:56
physical realm they're flat cuz they're
80:58
spiritual beings and then when they
81:00
fully manifest you see their whole
81:02
appearance and then and I took a bunch
81:05
of pictures of them and I was really
81:07
glad I took those pictures and and and
81:10
so that Scout you can always see the
81:11
glory somewhere on them you can see the
81:13
light of God on them and so I think
81:15
that's enough I'm going to talk about
81:17
one of the ones I don't know if they
81:19
have oh wait there's Piper see him on
81:21
your paper he sort of looks like a human
81:26
I'll be taking too long doing this I
81:27
hope not you know how many people don't
81:29
know this stuff they don't understand
81:33
their spiritual beings out there warring
81:34
on their behalf he's gonna get the stick
81:37
gotta go get the pointer oh that's his
81:42
nose you plainly see that pointed nose
81:44
right and then then his eyes see the
81:48
pupil in his eye see the pupil oh yeah
81:54
yeah right there's his eye there you go
81:58
and the outline and again for some
82:01
reason I get a lot of profiles of these
82:03
creatures and you see those pieces of
82:07
you see the streams coming up to him all
82:09
these streaks of the of the light he
82:13
actually and I'm gonna bring it back
82:15
next time I come he came off of a
82:17
transport from heaven that almost looks
82:19
sort of like a thin top and began to
82:22
spin and it spun him off in layers I
82:26
have layers of him it's wild because God
82:29
creates and liners remember so this is
82:31
the stream which is left but that's him
82:33
I have different layers of him coming on
82:36
these streams I could actually
82:38
picture the things spinning and these
82:40
light waves started coming off and it
82:42
was it was he was coming he was
82:44
transported and deposited this was
82:46
across the street of my home because
82:50
remember the army I had asked to come
82:52
they came and this is Piper and he's got
82:55
a like a Scottish ham on his head see
82:58
the plume it may not show you in here
83:02
but because this is a spiritual being on
83:05
the top of that plume our heads nothing
83:09
weird say we serve a mysterious God say
83:16
there are strange creatures in heaven
83:20
but to heaven they are normal we are
83:24
strange and he came oh I hope I know at
83:33
one time I outlined the other one but he
83:34
comes because the army came and he's the
83:37
inspector of the troops he was there to
83:39
inspect all the troops that were
83:40
assigned to me and he pipes with a pipe
83:43
like a little flute and his name is
83:46
Piper and he inspects those troops and
83:48
he looks huh he SC that points right
83:54
there so anyway he's fierce isn't he he
83:57
looks tough yeah and he makes those
84:00
troops believe he's tough because if you
84:03
had a sergeant that trained you in boot
84:06
camp I promise you they didn't look
84:08
happy or nice or even treat you nice
84:13
because they were to whip you in shape
84:15
my husband all the time talks about Camp
84:18
Lejeune where he was trained in the
84:20
Marine Corps if you swatted a mosquito
84:22
you dog a six foot by six foot grave and
84:27
put that mesquita in there and covered
84:30
it up chat you're right and if one other
84:35
troop laughed they dug a six foot by six
84:39
foot trench and found something kill the
84:43
mesquita and put it in there
84:45
because they were telling you better not
84:47
show one bit of emotions about what's
84:50
going on or you will have the same
84:52
punishment so those guys who train the
84:56
troops or inspect the troops they have
85:00
to be fierce they have to be focused and
85:02
it's no different in Heaven's army we
85:06
have armies because they have armies
85:09
they have positions
85:11
I trust you they have people that
85:13
inspect the troops they have troop
85:15
transports that bring the troops they
85:18
have captains they have generals they
85:20
have all kinds of Admirals in the Navy
85:22
they have lieutenants they have
85:25
positions of authority in the army and
85:28
so does heavens army so you're getting a
85:30
seat part of heavens army so wait if
85:33
there's another one let's see it this
85:35
one's a little bit harder to see but up
85:38
in this left-hand corner if you look
85:40
really good you can see a creature
85:41
riding on the head of an Aragon in the
85:44
middle of the picture you see a face
85:46
this got spikes on his head spikes going
85:50
right there see them and this head is
85:54
sort of shaped like that he's got Troy
85:56
he's got like diamond-shaped eyes move
85:59
it over a teeth there's one what there's
86:01
one and right across is the other eye
86:03
it's got again white white white he's
86:06
got like a mustache
86:07
that's his head and this creature over
86:09
in the left hand corner that looks like
86:11
he's got a crown on his head and his
86:15
eyes are right below it I / I you see
86:19
the shoulder of his arm right over to
86:21
the right of his face there's this whole
86:23
shoulder like this like bent there's a
86:27
shoulder on the other side and he's
86:28
riding he's got like a kind of a leather
86:30
skirt on right below his torso and his
86:34
leg is on that part of the creature
86:36
comes down and he's riding on that thing
86:40
into battle can you see
86:48
so that's an Aragon a different kind of
86:51
Aragon there's actually another creature
86:53
with him you can kind of see the face
86:55
kind of next to the head of the Aragon
86:57
and this was taken was at the beach just
87:01
walking and talking and he was there
87:04
writing in the sky under underneath for
87:08
hours he was old above where I was at
87:10
so they heavens real and they have real
87:14
real real hosts this is trooper and
87:18
coming he's he comes down you can see
87:21
his head he's got a big eye up at the
87:23
top of this white being that's his eye
87:26
he's got a mouth almost like a beak
87:28
coming out right here underneath his
87:31
eyes right underneath his eye comes out
87:33
of him right there and then the back
87:36
around his head if you go up the other
87:38
way that's the top of that going down
87:40
there keep going right there's the top
87:43
of his shoulder again you can see the
87:45
shoulder and his arm his hand is made
87:48
like this his hand is like this right
87:52
down here by his side see the hand yeah
87:56
see the opening in him it looks like
87:58
stairs that dark partner meets his neck
88:01
this an opening and out of him is coming
88:03
heads can you see the heads coming out
88:06
to the right of him come down right
88:10
there go across to the right to the
88:12
right right there's one and right next
88:15
to them is another one like it at the
88:19
bottom that's an angel go down down down
88:22
I'll go to the right that white light
88:24
that is an angel you see the streak
88:27
coming he's coming out and there's heads
88:31
although down his back go back to the
88:34
top of his head and then go slowly down
88:37
his back and you'll see faces keep going
88:40
keep going keep going right there are
88:42
some faces keep going there's a whole
88:43
head keep going keep going right down
88:46
towards the bottom a little bit more to
88:48
the left
88:49
teeny bit left see the eyes eye across
88:52
and that is a nine that's a head so
88:54
these are beings that have already come
88:56
out of here this might be too deep for
88:58
you but you better get ready for the
89:00
deep because we are going into deep
89:01
places
89:03
this is this is not I did not Photoshop
89:07
this I don't even know how to do
89:08
Photoshop
89:09
I'm too busy traveling and speaking and
89:12
main character heaven but this is
89:13
something again now this was in Kansas
89:16
this was in Kansas and the creatures you
89:20
see at the bottom that I've outlined on
89:22
this page right below Piper those troops
89:25
that's the whole line of troops hundreds
89:27
of them made exactly the same in there
89:30
and this is trooper that they came out
89:33
of now the person driving me was a
89:36
prophet and we were there in the middle
89:38
of America to declare stuff and to
89:41
declare different things and every
89:43
resurrection morning I'm there declaring
89:44
with my staff usually 8 a.m. when it's
89:47
like really cold
89:48
it takes me out of my comfort zone
89:50
because I'm usually sleeping but so this
89:53
creature comes down and he opens up and
89:56
then the army comes out and his name is
89:58
trooper because he transports the troops
90:00
some of you thought this is way beyond
90:01
wild but I thought this is what should
90:03
be happening in church you should have
90:07
revelation about the spirit round you
90:10
should know what spiritual creatures are
90:11
you should know what the army of heaven
90:13
looks like and what their operations are
90:16
that's where we came from you came from
90:20
the world where they live it was never
90:23
normal praise God so we're entering into
90:29
times that aren't gonna be normal but
90:32
when you begin to live in heaven culture
90:34
it'll seem normal to you and you will
90:38
begin to have encounters you begin to
90:40
hear God speak revelation to you and so
90:43
you need to understand he does operate
90:45
in mysterious ways
90:46
which means strange to us what God
90:52
usually does isn't the way man does that
90:54
that's what we can't get in our mind if
90:56
it doesn't line up with our mindset we
90:58
don't want it but God almost always does
91:01
something that doesn't line up or even
91:04
make sense to our head in the Bible he
91:06
almost never did anything that made
91:08
sense why rescue a whole group of people
91:11
then send them into the ocean to be
91:13
consumed
91:14
and then have the army chase them dinner
91:16
to the end and see what to die no he was
91:19
gonna do something more he was gonna
91:20
demonstrate and manifest his power on
91:23
their behalf so to us it was a that's
91:26
insanity to rescue a whole you know a
91:30
whole group isn't a group of people then
91:33
send them apparently into destruction
91:35
and Moses had to be willing to stand at
91:40
the edge of that water and hear God
91:44
step into it and the entire water obeyed
91:49
the command and parted and they walked
91:53
not on damp ground not muddy ground but
91:56
they walked on dry ground and in these
91:59
walls of water were all the cysts sea
92:01
creatures and all those things swimming
92:04
in the wall of water that was held back
92:06
by the angelic so there's one thing
92:10
right there that man would have never
92:12
done right so is there anything else
92:17
because I'm gonna try to finish this one
92:25
you can clearly see because I sketched
92:27
dead now this angel is a regional angel
92:32
he's overall the guardian angels of the
92:35
western states yes and I actually know
92:39
his name his name is jolt and he wars
92:43
with lightning a lightning staff that's
92:46
lightning coming off of him
92:48
is coming off of all over him the
92:50
glorious he again has what you would
92:54
think
92:54
and I saw him I was taken to the middle
92:56
of the the desert in Arizona outside of
93:00
Phoenix literally in the desert was
93:03
carried I was about to go do a six state
93:05
thirty-six meetings in six weeks in the
93:09
West and God said I'm gonna let you see
93:12
somebody who has authority some of the
93:15
hosts of heaven where the host of them
93:16
actually is ruling in that area pushing
93:19
back the darkness and he is fights with
93:22
the light my lightning power and he said
93:24
he's right there now so I instantly
93:27
just there and I was standing down from
93:29
him he was huge I mean the mountains
93:31
were behind him there's the mountains
93:32
behind him he was huge and he had this
93:34
lightening staff and it was alive and
93:37
those feathers at the bottom of his out
93:39
garment you see all have living eyes in
93:42
them and and you see the symbol that
93:45
symbol you see it in a lot of the North
93:47
North American Indians you see that
93:49
symbol on their tents on their blankets
93:51
that came from heaven okay and inside
93:55
that symbol are living eyes everything
93:59
on him was alive his eyes were like
94:03
triangular shaped even the pupils were
94:06
triangular shaped like a lightning bolt
94:08
and and off even that the tips of his
94:12
wings you see lightning coming off of
94:13
them and he had been fighting the
94:16
demonic in the desert because God was
94:19
about to do something new in Phoenix and
94:22
and if you don't know for sure King's
94:24
ministry is there and so I was going to
94:29
go speak actually at her place I was
94:33
going to speak I was being interviewed
94:34
by her and that many of the tapings
94:37
you'll see on my website calm you'll see
94:40
them I also have revealing heaven calm
94:42
and he said I want you to know who's
94:44
fighting and when I got there they all
94:46
got undone because I actually I'd
94:49
sketched it took it to my artist at 11
94:51
o'clock at night and I said you need to
94:52
refine this because I have to take it
94:54
and I want to show - Patricia Camus
94:56
people and they said that they had been
95:00
having reports the authorities have been
95:04
having reports of lights in the desert
95:06
like lightning bolts but there were no
95:10
storms and they didn't know what it was
95:14
and so I said well I said this is what
95:17
it is
95:18
and so he was using the lightning
95:21
Paragon to destroy the things of
95:23
darkness that were trying to start over
95:25
there and he probably was protecting her
95:27
in her ministry because she was stepping
95:29
into the supernatural at that time and
95:33
and so he was sense her to protect and
95:35
his name is jolt and we're gonna make a
95:40
t-shirt that says meet jolt one of the
95:47
hosts of heaven and none in the back
95:48
will say who's got your back who's got
95:53
your back okay cuz we got Heaven's army
95:56
that's he's got our back and if there is
96:01
it one more are y'all enjoying these God
96:11

96:15
things these are if you look if you look
96:19
in the very center of the picture you'll
96:21
see a skull just ahead I'm gonna show
96:28

96:29
I mean the very center it is a skull
96:35
right there you see the whole head it's
96:39
like right up there go go up further up
96:44
further to the middle of the picture in
96:45
the dark part right there go around way
96:49
up there's eyes all the way around like
96:53
a head down here's his chin and you see
96:58
demons coming out of his eye sockets
97:02
this is this is a demonic all of these
97:06
are part of the army of darkness if you
97:08
look over here there is a lion
97:11
there's his mane and in his mouth he has
97:17
a part of this being and these demons
97:20
are running as fast as they can this is
97:23
the lion's leg
97:24
this is his body this is all his Mane
97:27
right here there's his eye it's dark
97:30
blue see it so this is one of the hosts
97:33
they really look like a lion someone
97:36
would look like literal lines he is
97:37
attacking this demon right here in the
97:41
sky and out of his the skull of this
97:43
demon are coming many tiny mini demons
97:46
this whole thing right here is a demonic
97:48
this is the body of the skull this whole
97:52
thing from here to here and there's the
97:54
lion's mouth and you see that dark thing
97:56
in his mouth that's its tail so he's
98:02
attacking this is just a random picture
98:04
I got the sky when it was out speaking
98:06
somewhere so that's pretty awesome now I
98:10
know this looks kind of scary but it's
98:13
not this creature and again sometimes I
98:17
need to outline this is his mouth
98:19
roaring there's his eyes eye this is his
98:23
head he has a staff what is some of the
98:27
demonic that he has captured
98:28
there's heads 1 2 all those were heads
98:32
and he has been warring this is over my
98:36
house again they were bringing their
98:37
what they had caught they had caught the
98:40
enemies they caught the army of the
98:42
enemy the dark
98:43
and have them there's another creature
98:45
right now in here see and there's his
98:47
head looks almost like a snail
98:49
there's his body there's his neck he's a
98:52
good guy and this guy has got a
98:55
lightning staff and he's got all of the
98:58
enemy that he captured taking him back
99:00
up to half taking them to whatever they
99:01
take them probably a dry place I didn't
99:05
know that was on there that's that was
99:06
pretty weird say the army is fierce
99:13
because they're fierce against the
99:15
darkness they are not pretty boys with
99:20
harps oh this is a good one you're gonna
99:26
see you actually gonna see a nut you're
99:29
gonna see a witchcraft spirit in a
99:30
minute I was in Mississippi we had a
99:34
something happened in our meeting and a
99:37
woman was there filled with witchcraft
99:38
spirit and she was screaming when I
99:41
started talking about the face of God I
99:43
mean everything was fine I started
99:44
talking about the face of God was like
99:46
stamp of stone and this woman stands and
99:48
screams like non-stop and I was ignoring
99:51
it because the Holy Spirit said ignore
99:53
it he didn't say the woman ignore it and
99:55
so people are standing up rebuking it
99:57
how are you and Jesus because they have
100:02
a lot of witchcraft in Mississippi and
100:04
those people know how to deal with it
100:05
they're intercessors are powerful and
100:07
and I mean it's not like just a little
100:10
spirit of witchcraft I mean they have
100:11
omens hung on people's property and lift
100:14
lift on their doors and things written
100:15
on the door of their houses with symbols
100:17
and and they have driven a lot of them
100:19
out of a good part of that because I
100:21
came and taught him how to do it I
100:23
showed them greater warfare but but this
100:26
and I can't use that Jesus dick so we
100:29
told it and after this meeting my staff
100:32
got together one I'm not happy just
100:33
telling you to leave that person and
100:35
finally when the meeting was over she
100:36
started heading down and I have a black
100:39
pastor friend who lives in Memphis and
100:44
we were in Oklahoma Mississippi when
100:45
this happened and let me tell you when
100:48
those women take their earrings off and
100:49
their gold heels off you better get out
100:52
of the way
100:54
and my sister Jen was sitting next to
100:56
her she goes if she comes anywhere near
100:58
cat I am taking her down
101:03
Laurie lavender and their precious
101:08
people if you live in Memphis go to
101:10
their church it's powerful they live
101:13
heaven culture they live by revelation
101:15
and they're powerful people but they
101:16
came to hear me and so she did she
101:18
wouldn't put him back on so when the
101:20
meetings over here comes this woman down
101:22
right and I'm walking over there and
101:23
Laurie gets right next to me and I'm
101:26
okay it's gonna be okay and so he didn't
101:29
want me to make a scene because that
101:32
spirit wanted a scene he said you're
101:35
gonna hug her and release the anointing
101:37
all you can and release end her and you
101:40
say in her ear get out and when I did
101:44
that you could see her whole face is
101:46
like Jesus went it the spirit left and
101:49
she was crying and weeping and then the
101:51
pastor that the born-again CD was made
101:54
in his church that was his church where
101:56
that happened so he came down and
101:58
minister to her loved on her and so we
102:00
went back to our room our little
102:02
quarters and I said I'm not happy
102:04
telling you to leave them though lady
102:05
we're telling her to get out of town
102:07
and just four members of my staff we
102:09
held hands always said okay you spirit
102:11
of witchcraft get out of town in Jesus
102:14
name and that was it so the next day we
102:17
went into Memphis to look at some stuff
102:19

102:21

around the top of the head and you
106:36
remember that thing had had was a lump
106:38
on it there is on the back of its head
106:40
right there and that witchcraft sphere
106:43
is screaming because it was exposed and
106:48
I knew that it was leaving town because
106:52
we took authority in Jesus name and told
106:55
it it had to leave isn't that amazing
107:02
yeah it was a bad day for them so there
107:07
you see some of the darkness these are
107:08
these are Gabriel's these are some a gay
107:11
girls group they collect the worship and
107:13
every time you worship today every time
107:16
here there's so many angels with these
107:18
beautiful vials about this high and
107:20
they're lavender and they come up and
107:22
they go like this and they come by and
107:24
they keep all your worship they click
107:26
the worship from everybody every person
107:29
their worship goes in there they're
107:30
actually not holding swords they're
107:31
holding these vials but they're filled
107:33
with the the worship it turns into
107:35
golden incense
107:37
it talks about your worship being like
107:40
an incense before the throne of God and
107:42
so these this is a stairway into heaven
107:45
I literally saw the stairway this was on
107:47
the National Day of Prayer in my city
107:49
and God told me take my sketchbook and I
107:52
was sketching the scene and cinnamon
107:54
came up behind me went what is that and
107:57
I want those are angels who said I can
107:59
see they're angels but what is that
108:01
right there that's a stairway to heaven
108:03
I said when those vials are full door
108:05
carrying up and pour him before the
108:06
throne of God and it releases an aroma
108:08
in an incense from our worship and I
108:11
found out it was it was a rabbi he was
108:17
dressed like he was Jewish but I didn't
108:18
I didn't know what his title was so I
108:19
wasn't going on he gave me his card and
108:22
said when that gets done I want that to
108:23
put in my office
108:25
and he said I'm from such a such a
108:27
temple if you ever get time I would like
108:30
for you to come and speak and so there
108:37
it is it's finished and and so that was
108:40
from the National Day of Prayer man
108:41
there were thousands and thousands are
108:43
our city has a thousand churches in that
108:45
and for probably now twelve years the
108:48
pastor's of every denomination even
108:50
Orthodox Jews and if they all come
108:53
together the Messianic and Orthodox he
108:57
we even have Catholic priests come and
109:00
at noon every Tuesday at a business wwg
109:04
a mechanical contractors who's he's a
109:06
strong believer he holds this breakfast
109:08
in his employees lunchroom it's about
109:10
300 people they all come and they all
109:13
agreed to lay down their differences and
109:15
they all hold hands and pray for a move
109:17
of God to come to our city to bring the
109:19
church together to work together on
109:22
behalf of heaven and so so every time we
109:26
have a National Day of Prayer is
109:27
powerful and what you see down in the
109:29
middle you see like columns and the
109:31
middle one has like a red cloth like an
109:33
X on it if you'll notice how they're
109:35
dressed the Angels have their gowns and
109:38
they are wearing a red sashes crossed
109:40
like that and I know the persons they
109:43
they heard that had this vision from God
109:44
to create that you see the columns
109:46
behind them they were actually saying
109:48
that this is heaven this is what I
109:50
having spot is going to be and they
109:51
designed it exactly like what's behind
109:53
them even to the point of putting the
109:55
red sash on there I showed them this
109:57
painting and so mmm heaven comes your
110:00
your your worship is inhabited by God it
110:04
is precious it is powerful when these
110:07
angels travel back up to heaven they
110:09
break holes in the second heaven and
110:11
bash Satan's a Little Kingdom he set up
110:13
there and break holes in it and break up
110:15
buildings because these are spiritual
110:17
things your worship is spiritual it's a
110:20
spiritual weapon going to a spiritual
110:22
heaven so it actually does warfare on
110:24
the way up there so these are gamers and
110:27
they're called couriers or courier
110:28
angels
110:31
[Laughter]
110:33
Thank You Jen for your bit of humor that
110:39
cloud was over our house and Jen did
110:44
Photoshop it no a minion did not appear
110:48
over our house I'll make that perfectly
110:51
clear wearing a mustache and glasses but
110:57
when your sisters writing children's
110:58
books a children's author that's what
111:01
you get that's her revelation of
111:04
something in the heavens this is a pet
111:09
portal if you look right above this
111:12
black part right there's my thumb
111:14
holding my cell phone up and we're
111:17
driving in California on the way to do
111:20

111:22
Francisco and the Holy Spirit said get a
111:26

112:01
that your pets go to heaven and not only
112:03
that that this portal is your pets look
112:05
down and see you on the earth and and
112:08

112:32

112:35

112:40

112:51
was in Florida going down i-95 and we
112:54
were passing into from Georgia into
112:56
Florida and that pet portal was in the
112:58

113:10
it looks like a heart again with the
113:13
color around it that's a portal to
113:16
heaven right above that is a bearded
113:19
being looks almost like I call John back
113:23
straight up from the center of the heart
113:25

113:28

113:30
it'll over a little bit to laugh a
113:32

113:33

113:36
you see the face straight up in the
113:39
middle where the look right there's an
113:40
eye you went past his eye there's his
113:42
face there's his hair right up from
113:44
there is one that looks like Jesus right
113:47
there there are 43 beings in that portal
113:56
and I was standing on the little stoop
114:00
that that black pastor stood on at the
114:04
first school of Bethel school they had
114:07
and the students wanted to explore the
114:11
book of Acts and they wanted to see to
114:14
get filled with the Holy Spirit and they
114:16
weren't teaching that at that time and
114:18
so they asked parem who ran that school
114:21
can we pursue this and he said go ahead
114:23
and pursue it and after pursuing
114:24
pursuing it fell that's the portal the
114:27
Holy Spirit came from it's still there
114:30
from all those times it went from there
114:32
to Azusa Street it fell first in the
114:36
middle of America I went from there and
114:37
that little black pastor was not allowed
114:39
at the time to go in the room and sit
114:42
down
114:42
but parem knew enough not to not to mess
114:46
with God's purposes so he said I'll let
114:48
you sit out on this stoop and you can
114:50
sit on the stool and I'll let you keep
114:51
the door open so you can hear
114:53
he got more than all the students in the
114:55
school dead because of his hunger he
114:58
sold totally gotten invaded with the
114:59
Holy Spirit he took that from there to
115:03
Azusa Street in California so this was a
115:07
portal to open yeah and I and God let me
115:10
get a picture of it so I'm standing
115:12
looking up standing in that same spot
115:14
even took a picture of the doorknob has
115:16
so much glory in the doorknob but it's
115:18
the same doorknob subject which of the
115:20
doorknob and the glory is like coming
115:21
off of what where he's held it open so
115:23
he could hear truth that changed his
115:26
life that started a whole movement of
115:28
the Holy Spirit in our country Amen so
115:31
that's that's the that's where I got
115:33
that picture and put it in there so
115:34
that's an open portal and let me see
115:37
what time is it we're probably gonna
115:39
happen
115:39
Brooke yeah we're gonna have to rock it
115:41
into the next thing so this is really
115:44
just to acquaint you with the spirit
115:47
realm around you it's more real than
115:50
this natural realm and the way God
115:52
created the natural realm was he spoke
115:55
the word stepped out
115:57
he took a scroll at first it looked like
116:00
a drop of water because the River of
116:03
Life flows from God he grabbed it and it
116:05
was became a scroll he took it and he
116:07
stretched it around the spiritual realm
116:10
out in space and then that was the
116:13
canvas for a physical realm that he
116:17
could then put the planets in in the
116:19
stars in and then God treated earth took
116:22
one hand of water to put it on the earth
116:24
where the landmass was one landmass and
116:27
he and that one handful made the whole
116:29
ocean and he made the earth and then
116:32
before he remade it in verse 2 and so he
116:36
created the heavens and the earth he he
116:39
created you and birthed you from inside
116:41
him he wants you to have truth and
116:43
revelation so that you can be great for
116:46
him in this time amen amen
116:48
so I hope you enjoyed that we're gonna
116:50
have is there something else I need to
116:53
do before I do the laying on of hands oh
116:58
okay we're gonna take up the offering
117:00
and and either I can take it up or you
117:04
you better are you sure you want me to
117:06
take it
117:08
I'm just gonna say when you invest in
117:11
what God is doing it is powerful it you
117:16
know we can give and it will be given
117:17
unto you but when you give to what God
117:20
is doing right then in the earth it gets
117:24
multiplied even more because it's gonna
117:26
go for his purposes and not just his
117:28
purposes it's gonna be his will his way
117:31
and this is what he sends to me he says
117:33
if I send it I spend it and that's what
117:39
I live by regardless of what I need or
117:41
what I have to have I let God tell me
117:43
how to spend it because you belong to
117:47
him if you're giving it it's him sending
117:49
it and if he sends it he tells me how to
117:52
spend it and then I spend it where he
117:55
wants it amen so if you want to give
117:58
this is the time to give if you want to
118:00
make checks that make it out to gateway
118:03
gateway I'm not laying gateway on Mount
118:07
Zion I'm sorry I'm yelling yeah why on
118:11
everything everything goes to camp every
118:14
day everything comes to me so if I know
118:17
sometimes people I've seen people not
118:19
trust places and they will walk up and
118:22
give me money later you can trust this
118:23
place okay you can trust them they are
118:26
so hungry for revelation not many people
118:28
would come and let me do this or even
118:30
show you what you were shown because
118:32
they would have fear that it was not
118:34
true or that I was deceiving people I
118:36
don't know how you can deceive people
118:37
when you empower them bring them closer
118:39
to God share who they were where they
118:41
came from
118:42
open up revelation in the Word of God
118:44
tell you what time it is how to operate
118:46
in it
118:46
just be an agreement with God's Word
118:49
that he gave to you tonight a man and so
118:52
when you're ready we'll just go ahead
118:54
and start taking it up so if you want to
118:56
make checks out or give I greatly
119:00
appreciate all of it I take seriously
119:02
your giving of out of your own need
119:06
especially we know in this world it
119:08
costs money which is why the devil
119:10
doesn't want you to have money well it's
119:13
too late that's not going to work
119:15
anymore it's a lie that we have to be
119:17
poor to be holy you're holy because of
119:20
the blood of
119:20
Christ and almost everyone God used in
119:24
the Bible either had money or he gave
119:26
them wealth they were wealthy
119:29
God loves wealthy people that love him
119:33
because the money won't have you it's
119:38
not money that's evil it's the greed
119:42
it's the love of the money that's called
119:46
green that's a flesh thing we talked
119:51
about the spirit and the flesh greed is
119:52
part of the flesh wanting to take over
119:55
desiring things of the world just
119:57
sometimes they already have stuff they
119:59
just want more stuff because it's the
120:01
spirit of greed they can't they can't
120:03
stop doing it okay so it's about being
120:06
selfish and wanting for yourself but if
120:08
you want to help people to help empower
120:11
them to bless them to build things in
120:13
this time on the earth to help help
120:15
support whole groups of missionaries
120:17
send buildings there to be built on the
120:20
property
120:20
you know supply them the whole year
120:22
they're there I'm not talking about
120:23
hundreds of people are talking about one
120:25
person can supply everything that whole
120:27
group needs the whole time that they're
120:29
there this is the time we're entering
120:31
into where you will have wealth to go in
120:34
and buy a city if you need it to for God
120:36
he will he is going to buy up so many
120:40
these major resorts I mean like ten star
120:45
resorts that are not going out of
120:47
business he's going to set up believers
120:49
to go buy them transform them in and the
120:51
orphanage is going to the streets and
120:54
rescue 500 orphans put them in the best
120:57
place they could live he'll have people
120:59
ordered prepared to go in there and
121:00
train them and teach them in the love of
121:02
God they don't have to have little
121:04
hovels to live in anymore
121:06
because in this time we're gonna be
121:08
demonstrating and representing heaven
121:10

121:12
represent heaven heaven has the best
121:16

hey thank you Father for speaking amen
12:31
[Music]
12:41
amen we thank you for your presence
12:44
[Music]
12:52
the stand before the throne of God is a
12:54
powerful life-changing
12:56
[Music]
13:00
your flesh dies I know a lot of people
13:04
say you cannot see the face of God you
13:06
will die you're right your flesh will
13:12
die every thought you had of what was
13:17
important what was great
13:20
who you are what plans you had what you
13:23
thought about others even those who
13:25
attack you it dies it's like dust it's
13:31
like it never existed when you're
13:35
standing before the Holy One and you
13:38
burn for him because you're burning with
13:43
him our God has eyes of flames of fire
13:49
that's his passion for all of us even
13:53
those who don't know him he loves them
13:57
we all came from him we chose different
14:01
paths in our lives some of us just ran
14:05
immediately after him some took the time
14:09
to do it but they are now running after
14:11
them but even if it's at the very end
14:14
they run after him we all will receive a
14:18
great reward he does not want you to
14:23
remember your past when you did not
14:25
belong to him neither does he want you
14:28
to remember or talk about others paths
14:30
their past before they belong to him we
14:35
cannot repeat a matter we cannot speak
14:39
against our sisters and brothers if
14:41
they're born again now God remembers
14:44
none of their past why can never happen
14:48
we cannot hold things against people if
14:52
they repented God and given their self
14:54
to him it's like God said you remember
14:59
it no more that means you act like it
15:03
never happened that is love love is not
15:09
just loving God and hating others that's
15:13
not love because if he sent us to love
15:17
and to be just like him then you have to
15:21
forgive even if people have not said
15:24
something to you even if they haven't
15:27
said I'm sorry it happened you have to
15:30
act like it never happened
15:31
love does not remember that walking in
15:41
real love is living the truth and loving
15:45
others we cannot approve or agree with
15:50
their sin not ever sin is sin last night
15:57
he had me explained that making mistakes
16:00
that's different than sinning making a
16:03
mistake you just say I'm sorry that's an
16:05
apology okay so you can apologize for
16:08
things if there was no sin involved you
16:11
don't have to repent for that but we
16:15
have to be like him that's why he died
16:18
he died to multiply himself it says
16:22
don't think it's bad to count yourself
16:24
equal with him or he would not have said
16:28
we are joint heirs when the father said
16:34
and the son know ye not that ye are gods
16:38
they weren't saying that we were the god
16:42
of everything they were saying that we
16:45
are in their family we are many ones
16:49
many and what they were saying was you
16:52
have the right to have authority in the
16:54
spirit realm you have the right to have
16:56
power over all the part of the enemy you
16:58
have the right to stop the storms to
17:00
stop the earthquakes to multiply food to
17:04
call those things to be not as though
17:07
they were we can do that we are the
17:12
father sons and daughters
17:15
we're joint heirs with Christ he is our
17:19
bridegroom
17:19
[Music]
17:22
we cannot say that we're sinners saved
17:25
by grace anymore because you are not a
17:29
sinner and if you say that you're
17:33
talking about your past he does not want
17:36
you to talk about your past if you talk
17:40
about your past you will stay in that
17:42
place and if you talk about other's
17:45
pasts that are now believers you will
17:49
stay in that time our words are precious
17:54
but they're powerful we cannot ignore
17:57
what the word says about our words
18:00
everything he made he spoke into being
18:04
you speak things into being whether good
18:08
are not good if people are continually
18:13
bashing you and hating you
18:15
you have to forgive them but they
18:17
themselves are putting themself into
18:18
place they're not going to want to be in
18:20
because there are consequences to sin
18:25
even believers who do that are putting
18:28
yourself in a place they won't want to
18:30
be in and I pray for God to have mercy
18:32
on them I've had to forgive a lot and
18:37
act like it never happened even though
18:41
those people may not want to even accept
18:45
that that I pray for them for God to
18:47
have mercy on them to forgive them for
18:50
what they say against me or accuse me
18:52
wrongly of because I tell you the
18:56
persecution is the evidence that I am
18:59
doing right if you're being persecuted
19:03
God said count it as evidence that
19:06
you're standing in the right place with
19:09
him and he does not hold any of that
19:11
against you and I even tell people don't
19:15
even write it down what people have said
19:18
against me I don't want you to write it
19:20
down I have forgive them I want you to
19:23
act like they never did it that's true
19:26
forgiveness because then you won't
19:28
repeating it later you won't be
19:30
repeating it
19:33
you really have to be like that if
19:35
you're gonna represent him you can't
19:38
decide to be that way one day and then
19:40
walk in the flesh the next day when you
19:44
do that you are stepping back you can't
19:47
go forward in the kingdom making
19:49
conquest for Christ crushing the
19:52
darkness pushing it back speaking to the
19:55
water the land the air if you're doing
20:00
that going forward and then all of a
20:02
sudden decide you're just going to get
20:03
in the flesh and blasts people crush
20:05
people with your words you have a step
20:07
back into the flesh you stopped you
20:12
stepped out of the spirit walking in the
20:14
spirit you step back in the flesh this
20:16
is life this is death you speak life
20:21
you speak death you draw a life to
20:24
yourself you draw death to yourself if
20:27
you keep doing that you will not be fit
20:29
that doesn't mean you won't be in heaven
20:31
that doesn't mean he won't love you that
20:33
means you are not fit to go forward and
20:35
rule in the kingdom because when you do
20:41
that there's really no forward motion
20:43
this is what you're doing you can't go
20:46
to the next level of glory if you're
20:47
doing this all the time you're not going
20:50
to be a good witness if you're doing
20:51
this all the time people will not know
20:53
or even believe that you belong to God
20:55
if you love them one moment and then
20:57
you're bashing them if you love
20:59
strangers but you're bashing your own
21:02
family you tell about Christ how awesome
21:05
he is then you repeat everything wrong
21:07
that your family members are doing you
21:10
are going in the spirit and you're
21:12
stepping in the flesh because your flesh
21:14
wants to do that when you're walking in
21:17
the spirit and going forward you will
21:19
not fulfill the desires of the flesh and
21:24
the more you walk in the spirit you
21:27
begin to walk in his ways and you let
21:32
him have his will and when you begin to
21:35
do that consistently he will then give
21:38
you his own thoughts you cannot ask for
21:43
his thoughts
21:44
you can ask for his way you can ask for
21:47
his will and only when you begin to walk
21:50
in that will he give you his thoughts
21:54
and you want his thoughts the more you
21:59
have his thoughts the more you will know
22:01
him and understand him the more you will
22:04
want to be like him and not yourself and
22:10
what you actually becoming is the real
22:13
you that is not touched or controlled by
22:18
the flesh that then cannot be touched or
22:21
controlled by the enemy because the
22:24
enemy cannot use a dead person so when
22:30
you die to yourself to your own will to
22:34
your rights to your opinions to your
22:37
attitudes when you die to that you get
22:40
filled with him and the enemy will run
22:43
from you because you have died that is a
22:48
good place to be if I ever have a school
22:51
it's gonna be the school of dying and if
22:54
you don't come dead we will kill you
22:58
because I love being dead when your dad
23:04
things can't penetrate you the enemy can
23:07
waste his time all day long trying to
23:10
convince you of something and you can
23:12
just flick him away and he will run
23:15
people not waste his time on you trying
23:19
to use you or control you he will have
23:22
no control over you what we allow is
23:27
what we have right now what we have done
23:31
with our own will and chosen with our
23:33
will makes us who we are right now as a
23:37
man thinketh in his soul
23:41
so is he if you don't like you change it
23:46
say something different live differently
23:50
don't let people you know what that
23:53
means but it says got no me and take
23:55
your crown that means if you let people
23:58
wound you or hurt you or put fear in you
24:03
your crown is sliding off your head and
24:06
you let man do that man's words are not
24:10
supposed to hurt us or control us we
24:15
belong to the Living God we don't listen
24:18
to hell
24:19
we don't speak hell's language they have
24:24
one language just called profanity if
24:27
you have an issue with it get rid of it
24:30
because what you speak here will draw
24:34
the light or the darkness to you
24:37
fulfilled with the light of God and you
24:40
let darkness get in when the enemy comes
24:42
to check you out he'll see gray you
24:45
don't want him to see gray in use you
24:48
cannot mix the light with the darkness
24:52
it says don't hide your light how do you
24:54
hide your light you're letting darkness
24:58
in this is a holy time it's an exciting
25:05
time it's a powerful time it is a
25:08
humbling time if you all come believe
25:13
before God then you don't have
25:16
consequences this is a time of blessings
25:20
this is God's time to bless us this is
25:23
our time of great wealth great
25:26
excitement great prosperity joy
25:28
celebration creativity that's the time
25:32
you're in right now we're not living in
25:36
the past anymore we're whatever people
25:39
judge us judged us as we begin to
25:41
believe that God validates you not man
25:49
there's a lot of profits that really
25:51
only hearing God they may hear a word
25:54
and give a word but if that were to
25:57
crushes somebody that's mixed with man
26:02
if you don't say humble before God
26:05
especially as a prophet and you get
26:08
filled with yourself and people begin to
26:10
idolize you that voice that you hear
26:14
gets really thin and you begin to mix it
26:19
with your flesh and the word sounds good
26:22
and it sounds right but what kind of
26:25
spirit is this person walking in
26:29
we can't let self rule us we all have
26:34
wills we have a will we have a choice he
26:37
made us that way on purpose even the
26:39
Angels have a will the Angels have a
26:40
soul they had to choose were they going
26:45
to follow God or Lucifer every one of
26:48
them in heaven was tempted and he won
26:52
one third while he lived in heaven while
26:57
all these dangers lived in heaven they
26:59
knew God they knew he was a creator and
27:01
yet they chose the lie and when you
27:07
choose deception you become so deceived
27:10
you can't see that you're deceived
27:12
people believing these messages that say
27:16
you can freely send all you want to and
27:18
the grace will cover is alive from Hell
27:21
and sometimes you can't convince them
27:24
because they had said yes they have said
27:26
yes the people have said yes I can live
27:28
any way I want to it doesn't matter the
27:30
blood of Christ set me free you need to
27:37
keep your discernment sharp you need to
27:40
stay in the word you need to have a time
27:42
with God time with the Lord on purpose
27:46
if you have to set a clock and say I'm
27:49
meeting with you tonight at 10:30
27:53
and you go sitting-room and you wait and
27:56
just say I am here if you have to do
28:00
that for seven months two years three
28:03
years I promise you one day he's gonna
28:08
walk through the walls and you will see
28:11
him face to face whatever it cost to
28:17
know him it's worth it
28:18
but in running after him you cannot
28:22
abandon your family when you go to
28:27
heaven this is what God will say to you
28:32
he will not say how many people have you
28:35
won he would not say how much have you
28:39
given away to others he won't say that
28:42
he'll say did you love your family well
28:48
that's what he's gonna ask you the ones
28:52
he gave us and put us together
28:54
he chose before this earth was made who
28:58
your family members would be he put you
29:02
in a lineage he made you a generation of
29:06
something and we are accountable for how
29:10
we treat them we cannot force them to
29:12
receive Christ but you have to love them
29:16
you cannot enable them to stay in the
29:19
place they are if they're in drugs or
29:22
pornography or even crime don't give
29:25
them a place to live with you you will
29:29
enable them to stay right where they are
29:33
when they're old enough to know better
29:35
and understand and they don't want to go
29:37
by the guidelines the God has given you
29:40
to live by then they should not live
29:42
with you it's true we had many people
29:48
come and stay with us and if they didn't
29:51
want to go by the guidelines God has set
29:53
for our household we had to ask them to
29:55
leave because they'll bring hell with
29:58
them and you'll be battling it all the
30:01
time
30:03
so make sure you're hearing God clearly
30:05
if he said you help this person and then
30:09
ask him how do you want me to help them
30:11
because some of this some of us have big
30:14
hearts and it's hard not to just run get
30:17
them and bring them in because you have
30:19
such an awesome atmosphere presence of
30:21
God in your home but you want to
30:23
maintain that and if they're if they're
30:25
saying yes to your help they should be
30:27
willing to attend church they should be
30:31
willing to read the Word of God they
30:33
should be willing to allow you to pray
30:35
for them and if they won't do those
30:37
things then they don't have a right to
30:38
be with you amen see if you have
30:44
college-age kids that come home and
30:46
bring their drugs with them don't let
30:48
them stand at the door and say we love
30:51
you but that cannot come in you cannot
30:55
invite your friends over who are wicked
30:56
or living evilly because you're helping
31:01
them to stay in that place my mom would
31:05
just say I'm giving you to God and he
31:07
can help you but you cannot stay here
31:10
if you cannot maintain this atmosphere
31:13
that we have here
31:14
I had a great mom was she's still here
31:19
she lives with me she's still my mother
31:23
although I'm 66 I'm still her daughter
31:27
she absolutely loves my husband he is
31:31
the head of our house right now which is
31:35
very challenging right now since we all
31:38
live in our office I kept telling God I
31:42
wanted office is good change your home
31:43
into an office
31:46
you put everything in storage that is
31:48
yours personally and you make this look
31:51
like an office and we had 14 staff every
31:57
room and that place is the office even
32:00
our bedrooms have desks in it there are
32:03
no beds in there we sleep on sofas or
32:07
nice lounges but we obey we already know
32:12
the place that he's going to give us a
32:14
beautiful place beyond anything we could
32:16
afford and we know he's going to give it
32:20
to us but we obey when you set something
32:22
so make sure you know what you really
32:24
want when you ask him and not only that
32:29
we have the staff around us all the time
32:31
like running our microscope would you
32:36
like to move 14 people in with you if we
32:42
go off somewhere and we can't even say
32:43
we're going back home we're going back
32:45
to the office it's his office he can do
32:48
what he wants to there that's why he
32:51
trusts us because we've laid down our
32:54
own desires and our life for whatever he
32:58
wants whenever he wants it wherever he
33:02
wants it so it's wonderful to share
33:06
beautiful things to people about how
33:09
grand and fill with splendor and not
33:13
just peace but the absence of evil and
33:15
fear heaven is it's wonderful to talk
33:19
about these great days on the earth that
33:21
is for everyone all of his children in
33:25
this time he is offering you to live on
33:28
earth as they live in heaven it's called
33:30
heaven culture it's a new culture coming
33:34
to the earth not created here but
33:39
birthed from heaven and sent here for us
33:42
to tell and show what heaven is who he
33:49
is and who we are and when you choose to
33:52
live that way you live free from sin
33:55
free from lack free from fear
34:00
free from the enemy and heaven comes in
34:04
partners with you the angels are seen
34:07
all the time in her home and around our
34:08
home by people by the neighbors who
34:11
aren't even Christians they either
34:16
change or move really today my message
34:26
for you is how to live heaven culture
34:28
which also means to partner and command
34:33
the army of heaven heaven did not create
34:38
an army to protect itself god never
34:43
created the army to protect him he made
34:48
them
34:50
he doesn't need their protection he made
34:54
them for a purpose every tribe of angels
34:56
angels are made in tribes some of those
35:00
tribes are under Gabriel some are under
35:02
Lucifer and some were under Michael my
35:07
friends are the ones under Michael I
35:11
know some of them by name because the
35:13
father introduced me or jesus introduced
35:16
me our Holy Spirit introduced me this is
35:18
what happens when you become the friend
35:20
of God you become a friend of heaven
35:23
they celebrate your life because they
35:26
know you're gonna speak only truth that
35:30
you will forgive no matter what is said
35:32
or done against you you will bring life
35:34
and hope wherever you go that the glory
35:38
will wash over people the anointing will
35:40
wipe out the evidence of hell and hell
35:45
will burn if they touch that anointing
35:48
you know things about the past before
35:53
the earth was made you're shown things
35:56
about the future even the new earth God
36:00
did that with many of his friends my dad
36:02
was God's friend I found out about the
36:06
Father the Son and Holy Spirit from my
36:08
earthly father and his mother and we
36:11
have seven generations
36:13
of us who knew him most of them are
36:17
living in heaven right now they wanted
36:20
to go to heaven the other thing that the
36:24
Lord is offering is if you want to
36:25
remain till he comes again this is a new
36:30
time a new time when the supernatural
36:34
beyond your imagination will happen
36:36
there is not one human on this earth
36:38
that can gauge what the presence of God
36:42
the Father does when it touches
36:45
something but we will feel that on this
36:50
earth all flesh will feel it that'll be
36:55
a new day you've ever wondered about the
36:58
baptism and fire it has not happened yet
37:00
because you will know when it does you
37:05
the day the Holy Spirit moved inside of
37:07
you packed up his stuff and moved in you
37:11
knew when that day was you knew when
37:13
Christ became your Savior and then if
37:17
you loved him to be your Lord that's a
37:20
whole different thing you knew when that
37:23
happened so when you get baptized in
37:28
fire you will know it you will not have
37:34
to ask someone do I have the fire of God
37:37
because I've only had a measure of it I
37:40
still remember the day the month and the
37:45
year that happened to me when I received
37:49
it I was in church
37:50
and I was thrown and hid the usher
37:53
behind me and through both of us back
37:56
three or four rows into the congregation
37:59
it burned me like a blowtorch it burned
38:02
everything off the walls of my heart
38:04
that was not God it took away the memory
38:08
of some things that I didn't want it
38:11
catapulted me out of this world into
38:15
heaven my spirit man was taken out of me
38:21
and it was taken back in time it was
38:25
like you see on
38:26
Star Trek or Star Wars when they go warp
38:28
speed I watched he takes you back in
38:31
time and we were flying at such a rate
38:34
all I could see was light shooting at me
38:36
Shh
38:39
and I felt myself traveling it's the
38:41
only time every time he catches me up in
38:43
heaven I'm here and then I'm up there
38:47
and he was taking me back because he was
38:51
blessed that I had obeyed and said yes
38:53
when he asked if I wanted that and for
38:59
two weeks I could only speak in tongues
39:02
my body was in the church shaking and
39:05
they locked me in with a security guard
39:07
my pastor was wise enough to not touch
39:10
me they left a note stuffed up in the
39:14
sleeve my daughter when my mother comes
39:17
to and can crawl over to the side
39:19
call this number my dad will come and
39:21
get her
39:26
guys probably they're like 10 hours or
39:28
12 hours my body shook the whole time it
39:32
was the fire on me it's one of the
39:35
evidences yo shake you'll burn your body
39:38
will get so hot it will burn all fear
39:42
out of you it'll burn out the fear of
39:44
the face of man you'll burn
39:47
fear out of the face of the enemy it
39:51
will make you so bold you stand in the
39:55
highest mountain until everyone around
39:56
you about him all I talk about is a
40:00
father son Holy Spirit heaven the future
40:04
the new earth our weapons he's given us
40:08
crushing the darkness not tolerating the
40:12
enemy changing the atmosphere speaking
40:15
to the ground so produce can come up
40:17
speaking to the storms and the
40:19
earthquakes and the tsunamis and
40:22
avalanches even the fires it doesn't
40:25
matter
40:26
it can't a pulse you into a whole new
40:28
place where you fear nothing because
40:32
that fire you're gonna be baptized with
40:34
comes from the heart of the Father the
40:38
consuming fire that burns in him and
40:41
outside of him that the Lightning shoots
40:44
out of you may expect that to happen to
40:46
you one day
40:47
it's didn't somewhere a lightning bolt
40:49
start shooting on you that's fine with
40:53
me if he wants to do that I don't mind I
40:57
don't mind you're not the same person
41:01
and I only had a measure like a drop
41:08
when that fire touches the people on
41:12
this earth they're either gonna run into
41:14
God or run to get away from it the enemy
41:20
is terrified of that day he tear he's
41:24
gonna be terrified he's gonna lose a lot
41:26
of those who followed him a lot of the
41:30
supernatural be seen openly angels will
41:32
be seen everywhere moving and doing
41:34
things with
41:37
heaven really is invading this earth and
41:39
then the veils gonna be ripped away and
41:41
the spirit realm will be evident
41:45
there's the convergence of the spirit
41:48
realm into this natural realm it's gonna
41:52
happen and no one can stop it from
41:53
happening I'd rather be operating in it
41:58
than be ignorant of it that's why we get
42:07
baptized and fire it is literally a
42:11
separate baptism the Holy Spirit looks
42:18
like he's on fire all the time I see
42:22
fire trails all the time in my house but
42:27
when I go somewhere and sit and get up I
42:29
see fire on that seat everything I touch
42:34
I release it into it it can't be erased
42:38
it can't be washed off it can never be
42:41
watered down it's an eternal thing this
42:46
is what he wants for everyone this is
42:49
his passion for everyone to walk in that
42:51
place I'm not so special that I have
42:55
something you can't have but I chose it
42:59
I chose it every time he asked me
43:03
something I said yes so if you play with
43:08
your foot half way in the world and half
43:10
way in heaven you're not gonna go
43:13
anywhere because you're also like this
43:15
you get pulled from this side then your
43:18
friends are something influential to go
43:19
over here or you watch a horrible
43:22
demonic movie with graphic violence
43:24
profane language and sexuality you're
43:27
gonna be pulled way over here because it
43:29
goes in your soul what you watch goes in
43:33
your soul
43:34
well you here goes in your soul what you
43:38
say goes in everyone's soul that's in
43:41
hearing distance it goes in your own
43:43
soul you have layers in your soul so
43:48
whatever you Lao
43:49
on those layers that get stored there
43:51
that's why you can remember things your
43:57
your soul is your mind what you think
43:59
about your will what you choose to do or
44:05
not to do to say or not to say to hear
44:08
or not to hear you're the right to tell
44:11
anybody who's using profane language I'm
44:13
sorry but you know I don't listen to
44:15
health language and I'd like to spend
44:17
time with you but but you know I have to
44:19
go because I'm guarding my soul I let
44:23
God use my soul if you'd like to do that
44:26
let me know because if you stand there
44:29
and just allow and allowing allowing it
44:31
you're filling it in your soul
44:33
eventually it will come out of your
44:35
mouth amen
44:40
so this is a new way to live it's a
44:43
lifestyle change you're not here getting
44:46
a just a Bible meeting this is not
44:49
something just to try to remember some
44:51
scriptures that's not why I'm here I
44:54
already did that growing up the word
44:57
lives in me it comes out of me all the
44:59
time because I put it there but I've
45:04
guarded my heart and my soul for a long
45:06
time and I realized even in high school
45:10
I didn't have to be around people that
45:11
did stuff I was never part of a group or
45:14
a clique I didn't do drugs that happened
45:19
started in the 60s when I was in high
45:21
school I didn't tolerate it and they
45:23
found out real soon if they asked me
45:25
they would never ask me again so I set a
45:30
boundary boundaries for myself I wasn't
45:34
forced to take those boundaries but I
45:36
set them for myself and I stuck to them
45:39
because I realized even back then I knew
45:42
there was a god I really believed you
45:45
saw everything that I did or thought and
45:48
I knew my own angels because I'm a seer
45:51
we're with me all the time they live
45:54
with you give them some slack okay watch
46:00
something good
46:02
say something good someone wants to
46:04
fight don't fight with them your angel
46:06
will be cheering you on and applauding
46:09
you for speaking life when they're
46:12
giving you death and do you know that
46:15
when someone's bashing you to your face
46:16
you begin to say how much God loves them
46:19
you're piercing their soul with those
46:21
words and those words won't leave their
46:25
soul and there's something in there that
46:27
can fight the darkness in them I've seen
46:31
people in these fights domestic fights
46:34
or just fight somewhere you know
46:36
screaming at each other little demon
46:39
sits here and pricks that person who's
46:41
angry or upset and says to them I hate
46:46
you I can't stand you I don't ever want
46:49
to see you again and out of their mouth
46:50
I hate you I can't stand you I never
46:52
want to see you again and when the
46:55
person across them starts yelling back
46:57
they're doing that because this demon
46:58
jumped to the other person's over one
47:01
little demon this big they'll prick them
47:04
and give him the answer and the answer
47:06
will shoot out of their mouths and
47:07
escalates and then they're screaming
47:10
really horrible things and all is this
47:12
demon jumping back and forth picking
47:14
them laughing and laughing and laughing
47:16
and laughing that they are now
47:18
controlling those people whether they
47:21
are a believer or not you give
47:23
permission so don't do it no matter how
47:30
hard it is turn around and walk away
47:35
because you can stop that stuff we have
47:39
a choice to participate or not
47:42
participate these are all keys to
47:47
walking in the spirit the morning you
47:49
choose God's Way and not your flesh our
47:51
man's way the more you learn how to walk
47:54
in the spirit in this in walking in
47:56
spirit is more important than having
47:58
encounters being taken to heaven having
48:01
all the wealth of the world given to you
48:03
having great influence over people being
48:06
in a high position it's more important
48:08
to walk in the spirit than any of those
48:12
because in your life
48:14
God can use in great ways and you have
48:19
the most unexpected things happened to
48:21
you because you're walking in the spirit
48:25
and you're not fulfilling the desires of
48:27
the flesh amen
48:30
because what you get in return is worth
48:33
everything it's worth everything you
48:37
live in his presence all the time your
48:40
discernment becomes extremely sharp and
48:42
people won't be able to lie to you
48:44
you'll know what they're thinking before
48:46
they say something jesus knew the
48:51
thoughts and intents of everybody's
48:54
heart when it talks about the heart in
48:56
the Bible they're talking about your
48:57
soul why do they do that because you're
49:00
a living soul you are a living soul
49:04
people have described their self many
49:06
ways and held army but when he made
49:08
add-on what did he call Adam a living
49:11
soul when we lived in God we we had a
49:15
soul but we didn't need to use it we
49:17
need to decide where are we gonna live
49:18
what are going to eat what are we gonna
49:20
do we didn't have to make in those
49:22
decisions
49:23
he was our world he was our very place
49:26
of existence and him we lived we moved
49:28
we had our very being but when when Adam
49:33
was formed and the in Christ made him
49:37
the word made him when God spoke the
49:40
word made Adams body and then the father
49:43
leaned over and breathe Adams little
49:45
spiritual being into his nostrils and he
49:49
became a living soul who would then be
49:52
accountable for his actions his choices
49:56
what he was thinking what he was doing
49:58
what he was displaying because the other
50:01
part of your will is what you display in
50:04
your emotions so people know what's in
50:08
your soul and one day the father showed
50:10
me people walk up and they'll go what's
50:12
in your layers they won't say what's in
50:15
your wallet they'll be talking about the
50:18
layers of your soul if you're displaying
50:21
something that is not displaying haha
50:23
you're you're enraged something or you
50:27
just try
50:28
mashing people or you're spewing not
50:32
heaven all over the welcome to go so
50:35
what's in your layers because what I see
50:38
is not God because one day at least all
50:41
the body will know how their soul is
50:43
made and the Father said it will change
50:46
the way the body of Christ lives when
50:50
they realize what they're allowing in
50:53
there is causing them to think or act a
50:57
certain way and you can change that you
51:03
made trauma that wasn't your fault you
51:06
were innocent of it but it still was
51:08
recorded in your soul even if that abuse
51:10
wasn't against you and you saw what that
51:12
was recorded in your soul and it can
51:15
control you for the rest of your life if
51:17
you let it but you don't have to let it
51:20
you can choose with your own will to
51:22
loose that trauma from your soul like it
51:26
never happened because living heaven
51:30
culture means you're using the keys to
51:32
the kingdom every day of your life this
51:37
is a lifestyle he wants you to have any
51:40
lifestyle if you can live on earth as it
51:43
doesn't happen that means something is
51:44
going to have to change is that right we
51:47
had to have new things to understand how
51:50
we could put our self in that place and
51:52
not be affected by hell or man
51:57
the main way you do that is to keep all
51:59
their junk out no fear no offense no
52:05
unforgiveness no drugs no bashing no
52:11
doom and gloom
52:13
no fear at all no one's words that are
52:19
being said to you no matter how bad they
52:21
are you loose every word they spoke
52:24
every word sound image frequency
52:29
thoughts or actions of hell or man you
52:33
can loose them from yourself all day
52:35
long if you have to and you'll walk so
52:38
free
52:40
and your life it will be like you're
52:43
living in heaven they have a protocol to
52:47
do this you get filled with grace every
52:50
day well I have grace I'm gonna be saved
52:52
yeah you are saved you have eternal life
52:54
right but there's another kind of life
52:57
you can live - it's called abundant life
53:00
there's great fun dn't life if you know
53:06
living in abundant life you aren't
53:08
asking for that grace where is it in the
53:11
word or my throne of grace to find Grace
53:16
and help in time of need you need help
53:20
when someone's bashing you you need help
53:23
when you solve some traumatic thing or
53:25
some actions or images that you didn't
53:27
want to see what you see goes in here
53:31
does it say the eyes are the window to
53:33
the soul that wasn't just a remark that
53:37
was truth so your own self what you
53:40
choose to watch you're gonna be held
53:42
accountable for that you don't want a
53:46
lot darkness in the father said this to
53:49
me one day it's not that people or
53:52
businesses or churches cannot win but
53:58
somebody in leadership or chose to let
54:03
darkness get in it will affect you it'll
54:09
affect your whole life if you're the
54:11
head of your household it will affect
54:12
your whole family because then you're
54:15
carrying it with you and if you minister
54:19
and you got it you're giving it to
54:20
people if you're raising the family it's
54:23
going to affect everybody in there
54:25
because you allow things of the enemy to
54:27
come in if you watch horrible things on
54:29
television when your kids go to sleep
54:31
you still let the enemy come in amen we
54:37
allow or don't allow if you've been
54:40
doing that go home open the door your
54:42
house and you dipped all the enemy that
54:44
you have let in there
54:47
I'll go in people's home sometimes and
54:49
I'll see like demons standing right next
54:51
to the television they're not visitors
54:54
they're residents because of what was
54:58
continually watched in the home if you
55:01
ever buy a home that someone else lived
55:03
in make sure you cleanse it because the
55:06
atmosphere remains you're moving into it
55:09
it's there I don't go into a hotel
55:12
without kicking everything out of the
55:14
entire hotel and every room of every
55:17
every room in the hotel no matter where
55:21
I'm staying I'm not living with hell you
55:24
don't know what they watched in those
55:25
television you don't know what they did
55:28
in those rooms you don't know what they
55:30
said in those rooms because I can go to
55:32
a place and hear words that were spoken
55:33
for years ago friend of mine brought to
55:37
me - let me see their new school
55:39
facility and it was where the offices
55:43
were and the wherever I can't remember a
55:45
lot of human man things but it's where
55:48
you come in to sign in you know where
55:49
they read stuff the offices whatever I
55:52
went in there and I heard prayer like
55:55
I've never heard before I had images of
55:58
people laying on the floor crying out to
56:00
God like hundreds out there it was a
56:01
huge place they're crying out to God
56:04
calling in the move of God calling hope
56:06
for the people that were there and
56:08
crying out for their families and I said
56:11
what was this place before they said
56:14
well it's all remodel them and I'm not
56:15
talking about the Tilton what was here
56:18
what was done here they said why and I
56:21
told him what I saw and they began to
56:22
cry there but this is their 24 hour of
56:24
prayer house
56:26
all those prayers that ascended to
56:30
heaven were also still there so words
56:35
remain and some of them you wear on your
56:40
garments the Bible says do not touch a
56:46
garment spotted by the flesh people come
56:54
in my office I see words on them I hear
56:58
words that they weren't saying then my
57:03
people that my staff know that if I sit
57:06
in their chair I'll hurt every word they
57:09
said the night before I will see every
57:11
image of what they watched the night
57:12
before because the more you become like
57:16
Christ
57:17
you know the thoughts and intents
57:19
people's are and sometimes you wear it
57:23
on the outside of you it's a garment
57:27
it's been spotted by the flesh so if you
57:30
buy stuff from the thrift store
57:31
and I'm saying that because I love to go
57:34
treasure hunting I don't have to but I
57:37
love it
57:38
I will cleanse everything I buy whether
57:42
it's a trinket or a piece of clothing or
57:45
anything else that I take from there I
57:47
cleanse it for the kingdom I pick it up
57:49
I cleanse this for the kingdom it
57:51
removes everything that was ever spoken
57:53
that was in the presence of something
57:55
this is what the spirit realm is all
57:58
about this is why you need to recognize
58:00
the spirit realm is real and you don't
58:04
see it with your physical eye but it's
58:06
real and things remain that you release
58:10
in that spirit realm it's wrapped all
58:13
around this physical round when God when
58:17
God was in heaven there was nothing but
58:19
his home his world called heaven there
58:21
wasn't anything there wasn't the planets
58:22
there wasn't this earth there was
58:23
nothing and the word would step inside
58:30
the father and he would go somewhere
58:31
where there's nothing and the father
58:33
would speak and the world would step out
58:36
make it that's why the word says there
58:39
wasn't anything that was
58:39
that wasn't made by the work he was
58:43
called the word because he took his
58:45
words and made them that's how that's
58:49
done when he said Jesus said to the
58:53
Father you and me and me and you that's
58:56
what he's talking about
58:56
they went someplace together and created
58:59
together but the spirit realm is the
59:05
original round it's not just the other
59:08
realm it's not just some kind of round
59:11
it is the permanent eternal realm that
59:15
existed before this physical world was
59:18
here and when God spoke the Lord the
59:25
word there was a little drop of water
59:28
and from it he pulled a scroll and he
59:30
took the scroll and opened it like a
59:33
curtain and wrapped it around the
59:35
spiritual realm that's why at the end he
59:41
said I will take it and fold it away
59:44
like an O garment he's talking about the
59:47
physical realm talking about the plan
59:50
that's this earth people don't like it
59:52
when I say there's gonna be a new words
59:54
you should celebrate if God's gonna make
59:55
it it would be better than this one and
59:59
people go oh no the very core the center
60:01
will remain it doesn't matter
60:02
he says he's folding it all the way like
60:05
a garment you know why he knows where
60:07
the ends are and he'll just fold it up
60:10
and go away and create a whole new thing
60:16
he knows that things remain in that
60:19
spirit realm and people always talk
60:22
about well you know my dead relative is
60:24
living in my house and they turned the
60:26
lights off and I bump things no that is
60:28
not your dead relative no one remains on
60:34
this earth when they die they go one
60:39
place or the other their body may die
60:45
and be buried but their spirit man which
60:49
is very much alive
60:51
remains either in heaven or in hell and
60:55
I've seen both you want heaven because
61:00
in heaven you just to live and hell
61:02
there's not even existence let alone
61:05
living it's as real as heaven is and
61:10
what we say and do with their life will
61:13
attract one side or the other
61:15
that means your angels are with you all
61:17
the time but if you're doing something
61:19
wrong the demons are laughing at your
61:21
angels this is a real life this is this
61:25
is truth you want truth you couldn't get
61:27
all the truth that's why we're held
61:33
accountable and the thing is when you
61:35
begin to walk in the spirit you have
61:38
learned the joy of obedience when you
61:42
walk in the spirit there's not
61:43
consequences
61:45
it's a place you've lived in John was
61:51
Indy say it loud on the Lord's Day so he
61:57
wasn't in the flesh he was in the spirit
62:00
that's when you heard and saw the door
62:02
open and the voice all that that was in
62:05
the spirit when he was walking in the
62:06
spirit he probably wasn't even on the
62:08
Isle of Patmos he was the closest
62:14
disciple to Christ
62:15
he got as close to him as he could he
62:19
wanted to be just like him and this was
62:21
one of the sons of thunder who couldn't
62:23
wait to fight with his brother over
62:24
girls
62:26
he was so changed by Christ by following
62:32
Christ believing Christ he believed he
62:37
had risen from the dead remember that
62:39
John the Beloved the one Christ loved
62:42
the one who loved Christ I love all the
62:45
little tags he gave himself didn't even
62:47
say John the one who loved Christ the
62:51
one whom Christ loved where he loved all
62:54
the disciples but the one who stays the
62:56
closest gets the most of him he even
63:00
took John back in the past how do I know
63:05
because he couldn't make that statement
63:08
John couldn't state make that statement
63:10
the Word was with God and was God and
63:15
there was nothing that was made that the
63:18
word didn't make he would not have known
63:22
that unless he was shown that he also
63:25
knew the word became flesh he knew who
63:28
Christ was before he was Christ still
63:32
same being but the word was all spirit
63:37
he didn't have flesh on him he didn't
63:39
even look the same Satan did not
63:41
recognize him he kept trying to figure
63:44
out who he was do you realize that even
63:49
on the Mount of temptation he but they
63:50
didn't know who he was but he was trying
63:52
to find out because his features weren't
63:56
the same as when he was the world
64:00
because John became a friend not just a
64:06
disciple did you become God's friend he
64:09
shows you things and he takes you places
64:12
he always did that in the past he hasn't
64:15
changed he still does it
64:17
amen so that's why we need to be
64:20
accountable and really care not feel
64:23
like we're being commanded to do it or
64:26
forced to do it guys drink some water
64:34
one day I believe I won't have to eat or
64:37
drink
64:37
I've only eat of him and drink of him
64:42
and heaven you don't have to you eat
64:46
because you want to not because you have
64:50
to even God likes to eat
64:53
does she Christ Christ got ruined by the
64:57
sweets
64:59
his flesh wanted the sweets I don't
65:04
think he much cared when he was just in
65:05
the spirit all the time but when he came
65:07
to this earth grew up like we did he
65:09
fell in love with sweets blame your
65:13
sweet cheese on him we are joint heirs
65:16
with Christ I don't know very many
65:20
people that don't like sweets I will
65:22
raise my hand who likes sweets let me
65:23

70:59
the best part I actually was invited by
71:03
the Lord to go to someone's home that
71:05
was living in heaven they didn't see me
71:06
nobody in heaven sees me when he takes
71:08
me there he hides me in heaven because
71:11
if he did not they know what I do down
71:14
here they know I go there and come back
71:16
here they would be chasing me down the
71:18
streets of gold handing me pictures of
71:20
their family members with their names
71:22
written on it their addresses because
71:24
they know where you live and their phone
71:26
numbers and they would say please go
71:28
tell them I love them I'm making plans
71:31
for them I'm so excited for what they're
71:34
doing today I can't wait to see them
71:36
again that's what they say they get a
71:40
little singing a pom quarter I don't
71:42
know what you call it and every time I
71:43
see a place you would like they put it
71:45
in this when you come up in heaven
71:48
they'll hit it here comes this list and
71:51
then want to take you to every one of
71:53
those places and taste all these
71:55
different foods from different bakeries
71:56
different restaurants I was invited to
72:00
this place and I saw this dining room in
72:02
a mansion would see 100 people and all
72:08
the tables were set like a king's
72:10
banquet and all the family members and
72:13
friends and the prophets and the
72:14
Apostles all came we're coming to eat at
72:16
this person's home and everyone sat down
72:20
and they still think God for the food
72:23
isn't that awesome and then they said
72:25
what they want it appeared on
72:27
everybody's plates
72:28
to perfection Meiji perfection the best
72:33
tasting none of it was ever left on
72:36
anybody when you ate it and we're done
72:40
it all disappeared off the plates nobody
72:44
cleaned it up there is no garbage in
72:46
heaven there's no waste in heaven say
72:49
that's heaven that's where I'm gonna
72:52
live one day
72:54
don't worry about your little grandma
72:56
she's not up there scrubbing dishes for
72:58
a hundred people but I know some
73:05
grandmas that love to entertain and
73:07
actually cook cooking is our gift they
73:10
will have a fully supplied kitchen three
73:12
times bigger than this room is their
73:15
kitchen and there'll be appliances and
73:18
weird things there that we never had in
73:19
the search that they use to prepare all
73:21
the food and what they're given is not
73:24
like real animals that died it looks
73:28
like it because it's made out of light
73:31
they put in their order the angels
73:33
deliver the food and the groceries
73:36
whatever they need vegetables doesn't
73:39
matter what it is side dishes the
73:41
entrees the desserts but this grandma
73:43
that was a grandma that now looks 25 is
73:46
going to cook for all 100 people and she
73:49
I saw her I saw her in her kitchen she's
73:52
gonna make salad and they had salad
73:53
bowls like this she was slicing
73:55
cucumbers as she sliced a cucumber and
73:58
the peel came off it disappeared there
74:01
was no trash whatever she peeled off it
74:04
disappeared and she was just singing and
74:08
so happy some new family members they
74:11
come in to heaven and she was throwing a
74:12
party for them that's what she was doing
74:13
so there was no waste there was no
74:16
garbage but what was left was the best
74:18
meal they ever had so that's like what
74:21
happens when you go to visit someone in
74:22
heaven and that awesome it is worth
74:27
everything you live in the manifest
74:31
presence of God his presence is in your
74:33
furniture piss in your floor's it's in
74:37
the walls even the walls of your home
74:40
will worship God the streets of gold
74:42
worship Him every pebble in heaven has a
74:45
face and they worship God the flowers
74:47
sing the trees sing is a powerful
74:52
beautiful place to live and they are
74:55
watching our lines
75:00
now they don't see a lot of the
75:02
tragedies that happened and they don't
75:04
see every sin that somebody committed
75:06
because it's time to celebrate but they
75:09
know what God's plans are for you and
75:10
they would declare over you every day
75:14
amen if you were angry please please
75:19
hear this if you had a fight with them
75:21
and then they died and you didn't get to
75:25
say you were sorry
75:26
they already forgave you and if you
75:29
mention it to them they won't remember
75:30
it when you get there they'll be so
75:34
happy to see you if it makes you feel
75:37
better just look up and say I'm so sorry
75:39
Bob that fighting out there they're
75:40
gonna go what was that I don't remember
75:43
that they'll remember every good and
75:45
happy thing that you did every gift you
75:48
gave them every time you kiss them every
75:50
time you hugged them they love you more
75:53
now than they did when they were here
75:55
because now they're filled with that
75:57
love this is how while the love of God
76:02
is there can be somebody who killed
76:05
somebody and that person went to prison
76:07
and that person in heaven will pray all
76:12
the time
76:12
God's let them know you I forgive them I
76:16
want them to know you they need to know
76:18
you and they will pray over that person
76:20
all the time to know the Lord send
76:22
someone to talk to them
76:24
let your spirit go consume them but let
76:26
them know you that's how much they love
76:29
him that person gets saved in prison
76:31
they go home to heaven they are best
76:33
friends
76:35
best friends best friends
76:40
that's how far-reaching the love of God
76:43
is that's why he wants us to live the
76:46
way I've been talking to you about our
76:49
life is a witness it's a testimony of
76:52
who we are of who he is and you need to
76:57
know all this because one of the most
77:00
powerful things we do so there's a
77:02
protocol in heaven if you want to live
77:04
on earth like they do in heaven every
77:05
morning when you get up before you get
77:07
out of pad this works I get more emails
77:11
about this one simple thing that
77:14
anything else God has me teach people
77:18
it's the scripture about the throne of
77:20
grace you yourself every day of your
77:24
life can be filled with fuel from heaven
77:28
that will be poured into your being that
77:31
will make you feel different act
77:33
different
77:34
think different and you won't show up at
77:37
your friend's house heaven well it's
77:41
real simple the Bible says that the
77:45
father filled his own son with that
77:48
grace he didn't have to fill a son with
77:51
eternal grace but he had to have grace
77:54
for abundant life because then he could
77:57
tell people I come to bring a life and
78:00
life more abundantly
78:03
you know what abundant life is it's
78:05
being free from all kinds of things that
78:08
come you face every day
78:10
everyday normal things you go to work
78:12
people are egging where you're getting
78:13
blamed for something you didn't finish
78:15
something you're getting blasted by
78:16
somebody or ridiculed by somebody if you
78:18
are filled with that grace from heaven
78:20
it won't even touch you it won't it's
78:23
hard to even be afraid or get afraid
78:25
because fear can't penetrate it it's
78:28
heaven in you by simply saying every
78:32
morning I asked for father because
78:36
remember we're talking about his throne
78:38
father everybody say it father
78:41
say it loud father I asked for and
78:46
receive grace for this day amen
78:52
and right now in my being I feel it
78:55
being porn in it feels like light
78:58
electricity I literally feel if I said
79:01
or five times a day I would feel it
79:03
coming in its fuel and it only comes
79:06
from one place heaven how simple is that
79:10
it did not cost you a dime nothing it
79:13
cost you nothing it is free ask for it
79:17
you have not this is one major thing to
79:23
living on earth as they do in heaven
79:25
because they're filled with that all the
79:27
time they walk in it all the time
79:31
there's nobody nobody gets angry in
79:33
heaven no one's fearful nobody has
79:35
regrets nobody's condemned
79:37
nobody is rejected there's no room for
79:41
it because they are filled with heaven
79:43
you can have that on earth as it is in
79:48
heaven that is the number one thing you
79:51
learn about living on earth like they
79:53
live in heaven I had to do all these I
79:56
do every one of them the second one was
79:58
loosening stuff from your soul it's
79:59
called a soul checkup and I don't do it
80:03
every now and then I probably do it 15
80:06
times a day because of who I am and what
80:10
I'm confronted with I don't keep
80:12
anything inside of me that people say in
80:15
emails and comments on the phone in
80:18
person through a second or third person
80:21
I don't keep it I don't want it I don't
80:25
have to keep it so as soon as something
80:27
happens I go I choose to lose all those
80:29
words unkind harsh negative judgmental
80:33
words I loose them from my soul right
80:35
now I will not keep them and I bind to
80:37
my soul the love and the life of God and
80:40
then I'm joyful all the time I've
80:43
already got fuel from heaven now I'm not
80:46
keeping anything in my soul the keys to
80:48
the kingdom
80:49
what you loose on earth will be loosed
80:53
from
80:55
and heaven will come and pull it out
80:57
because Christ is the restorer of our
81:00
soul if you have cares you cast them on
81:05
him he comes and pulls them out but it's
81:08
the keys of the kingdom you bind and you
81:10
loose I bound the devil for years most
81:13
intercessors buying the devil all the
81:15
time you can buy them if you want to buy
81:17
grab the loose in light of my life
81:18
I know my family's life I'd rather loose
81:20
invite in my home and then buying the
81:23
things of God because what you lose from
81:25
your soul leaves what you bind in your
81:29
soul will remain if you want to be happy
81:33
this is this is real this is real this
81:36
is how we live on earth as we do in
81:38
heaven we do these three there's three
81:41
things it's a protocol first when you
81:44
get right second one you don't keep
81:46
anything in your soul you don't want
81:47
there and the first time you do it every
81:50
trauma you ever had is gone it can even
81:52
addictions we've even had witchcraft
81:54
spirits loose from people's soul when
81:56
they chose chose to loose it from their
81:58
soul it's gone like it never happened
82:01
what you loose on earth is loosed from
82:05
heaven like it never happened
82:07
what you bind on earth it will be bound
82:11
and written down in heaven you can find
82:14
the life of God the love of God the
82:18
presence of God the celebration the
82:23
expectation the creativity is unending
82:27
and guess what you have it in there and
82:32
then you will live like that
82:34
that's what you think on it's what you
82:37
choose it's what you're going to
82:38
demonstrate with your emotions if you
82:41
love joy and happiness and a great
82:44
future and your gift being used you can
82:48
bind every one of those to your soul and
82:50
he was trying to teach us something when
82:53
he said don't let the Sun go down upon
82:56
your wrath otherwise it will stay and
83:02
yourself and you'll get up in the
83:04
morning and you'll be angry
83:06
and you'll think about it you talk about
83:08
how angry are your filling the layers of
83:10
your soul with anger then you can stay
83:13
angry then you'll be so angry nobody
83:14
wants to be around you what is in there
83:19
is what you will become so don't let it
83:21
stay you don't have to keep it you don't
83:24
have to keep depression oppression
83:26
despair or suicidal thoughts you can
83:29
loose every one of them from your soul
83:31
the father spent four earth hours
83:34
teaching me about the keys to the
83:37
kingdom
83:37
he said because you're willing to listen
83:40
I'm gonna show you who Mel cuz if it is
83:43
she came your promises because I'm gonna
83:46
have you trained everybody everywhere
83:48
you go you're gonna train them how to do
83:50
a soul checkup it will change the way
83:52
the body of Christ lives they won't need
83:55
deliverance they won't need six weeks of
83:57
counseling because they won't keep
84:00
anything in them he said and when people
84:03
who do counseling learn to do this those
84:05
people won't have to come back for a
84:07
second visit I have amen I have youth
84:12
centers youth centers youth and by me to
84:17
come and train all their workers how to
84:18
do this and they're crying the entire
84:21
time they say when you youth come to us
84:24
it's on drugs and they're in despair it
84:26
takes it's a year just to get them free
84:29
we'll do in five minutes they can have
84:33
the whole year to get stronger and more
84:36
powerful in God and know who they are
84:38
without carrying that and that's what's
84:41
happening these places are getting
84:43
undone I was shown the future I saw in
84:47
businesses in churches a little thing on
84:49
the door that says soul doctor
84:53
you all need to be so doctors God calls
84:55
me a soul doctor I saw them even
84:59
businesses had them because when people
85:01
get undone or sad or broken you're not a
85:04
good worker you're actually not good for
85:08
much of anything you're in a pitiful
85:11
place I know I worked in a law firm and
85:14
the ones who did the family law the
85:16
divorces and all that stuff like that
85:18
they were always so burdened down
85:20
because they're carrying all that inside
85:22
of them they could be free in five
85:26
minutes
85:28
free from homosexuality we have a young
85:32
person in Lamar Missouri just because
85:36
they lose two from their soul it ran out
85:40
of them and they have never had any of
85:43
those feelings emotions again it is
85:47
powerfullest like you mix the greatest
85:49
deliverance and intercession that you
85:52
could possibly do or look for in the
85:54
earth is available to you personally
85:58
every intercessory group needs to know
86:00
about this it changes the way you pray
86:04
for people how you feel yourself you
86:07
can't carry those burdens I know someone
86:09
who was so burdened down with
86:10
everybody's problems and things you were
86:13
going through she's a powerful woman of
86:14
God it aged her so much she went around
86:17
sad and just broken and I said you
86:19
cannot live like that anymore God didn't
86:22
tell you he had to carry those things
86:23
she loosed him off from her soul and now
86:26
she has a whole new life it will change
86:31
the way we live as the body of Christ
86:32
and the third thing you taught me was
86:35
how to invite heaven's army to be my
86:38
weapon and command the army I don't have
86:42
time to read every scripture that talks
86:45
about us commanding or being commanders
86:47
there are many there are many scriptures
86:51
in the Bible to talk about that I love
86:53
the one where God said come in-you me
86:55
that means you're supposed to be a
86:57
commander that doesn't mean you're gonna
86:58
tell him what to do that means you're
87:00
gonna say what will happen people we
87:03
can't do that what is called those
87:04
things that be not as though they work
87:05
we're saying
87:06
something right there to create
87:08
something right there you should eat the
87:10
works of your mouth you know that that's
87:13
because what you're saying whether good
87:14
or bad is what you're gonna have we're
87:16
already using our mouths to create but
87:20
we need to command command Satan to get
87:23
out of your face get out of your home to
87:26
get out of your finances but we're not
87:29
supposed to fight him our battle is the
87:33
spiritual battle is that true we do not
87:36
wrestle against the flesh but we spend
87:39
so much time fighting each other we
87:42
don't do anything against the enemy amen
87:47
it's really simple there's another
87:51
provision protocol in heaven you have to
87:52
invite we didn't have Christ until we
87:56
invited him is that true amen
87:59
we didn't have Holy Spirit until we
88:02
invited him during 12 us is that true we
88:06
were asking so we received the same
88:11
thing goes for the angelic you have to
88:16
invite them to be your weapon when the
88:19
word says that our weapons they are
88:22
Mahdi it doesn't say it not saying your
88:26
weapon isn't it it says they who are
88:31
they who is created informed by God to
88:35
fight the darkness the army they are our
88:42
weapons who pull down the strongholds of
88:45
darkness around us who shred the
88:48
platforms that demons have been ruling
88:50
from for years but they were not given
88:54
permission to just go attack on the road
88:56
and say they are a military a military
88:59
needs orders
89:02
they need the authority of your person
89:07
giving the orders so who has given
89:10
authority over the darkness
89:12
say it loud so we've been given the
89:17
power say we have a power given to us by
89:22
Christ that is over all the power of the
89:25
enemy
89:28
you can say Christ commanded the host
89:34
even as a righteous man when he's being
89:38
judged by the Sanhedrin he said if I
89:45
wanted to I could call the army of
89:48
heaven to fight on my behalf he was
89:54
showing us we had the right to do that
89:57
so if we have the power over all the
89:59
part of the enemy which by the way we're
90:01
not using it
90:02
or we wouldn't be harmed just to say
90:07
that in the word I'll give you power
90:09
over the brother noon you know I know
90:10
about the stepping on things and all
90:12
that but at the end of it scripture says
90:14
and nothing by any means shall harm you
90:21
Luke 10:19 he wasn't just telling us a
90:27
nice story he was showing us who we were
90:33
so if he did this even walking as a man
90:38
he could come in the hosts are we joint
90:41
heirs did he say what I did you can do
90:44
that gives us permission that gives us
90:48
permission we are not under the Angels
90:52
we are over them we lived in God we are
90:57
his offspring they're not his offspring
90:59
they were all created for a purpose if
91:01
one third of them were created just to
91:04
fight the darkness well it's not in
91:08
heaven no not theirs being threatened
91:12
but he comes here the enemy to kill
91:15
steal and destroy that doesn't mean we
91:19
have to let him
91:23
we are concerned royalty we have a
91:28
kingdom that I'm talking about right now
91:30
living heaven culture is operating in
91:33
the kingdom the pearl of great price
91:36
sell all you have just to get that that
91:39
means give it all up you're flush
91:41
especially yours you're flush your mind
91:44
says stop having to justify everything
91:49
if God's given it to you you just take
91:52
it and then you do it because having
91:57
heavens army to command them the number
92:01
one thing they're going to protect is
92:02
you and I and my husband will testify
92:06
have not been attacked by Satan in six
92:10
years is this true yes it is true
92:14
because why I use the army and I command
92:19
that and when you invite them to be your
92:22
weapon because you have to invite you
92:26
get 100 members of heavens best assigned
92:31
to you and they will live in the sky
92:33
over your home
92:35
they won't come and fight and go back to
92:36
heaven they're being assigned to you
92:40
every King has an army but if that King
92:45
just sat there even in the natural for
92:47
King and then after sat there and did
92:49
nothing with their army they would be
92:50
run over they'd be robbed from they'd be
92:52
killed than having stolen from this is
92:54
this true that's what we've been doing
92:58
that's why we need revelation revelation
93:02
changes everything
93:03
revelation on the Word of God revelation
93:06
honoring God what who he says we are
93:08
revelation on what heaven is what the
93:10
spirit realm is where our rights are
93:12
what our Authority is where our weapons
93:14
are that doesn't mean you don't use the
93:16
blood of Christ the Word of God doesn't
93:19
mean you're not going to use them but
93:20
add this weapon to it
93:22
and this army harkens unto the word of
93:27
the Lord now I know you think that just
93:33
means Jesus Christ
93:35
we are spiritual Lords under the Lord of
93:41
lords and we are kings spiritual kings
93:45
under the King of Kings he didn't write
93:49
down on his side cuz he was talking
93:51
about King David or Solomon it was us in
93:55
this time on the earth literally ruling
93:59
with him we don't have any of that
94:02
authority without him but he gave it to
94:05
us you do really simple you choose with
94:10
your will to invite heaven's army to be
94:11
your weapon and then you thank God and
94:14
then 100 members are signed to you
94:17
immediately and then you learn how to
94:19
send them an assignment you have to give
94:22
them orders you couldn't go to our
94:24
military here and send them some more
94:25
and not have a written out by someone
94:27
who has the authority to give the orders
94:30
and they decide they don't decide I'm
94:33
going to do this order but not that one
94:35
they can't do that oh well we're gonna
94:36
do this but we don't want to do that one
94:38
we're just gonna do this and go back
94:41
their butts would be in trouble they
94:45
would get chewed out they'd have all
94:48
kinds of things assigned to them that
94:49
they don't want to do I'm talking about
94:51
the Earth's military my husband's a
94:54
Marine once a marine always a marine oh
94:56
he had training in Parris Island he
94:58
knows exactly what I'm talking about
95:00
they can't decide to do things on their
95:03
own they have to go to the ones who have
95:06
the authority to give the orders we are
95:12
the only ones who have authority to give
95:13
the orders
95:14
I'm not saying Christ can't be ternoon
95:17
that forever he is now saying as joint
95:19
years you're doing this if you want to
95:21
not be attacked or not harmed or not
95:26
having stolen from you that army will
95:29
keep it from happening they can bring
95:32
back wealth that was kept from you you
95:35
can send them in all the traffic and
95:36
they'll do traffic control and you will
95:38
never have an accident
95:41
never the only time I've ever was when I
95:44
forgot or when he forgot never that's
95:50
part of what they do for you
95:53
amen and then you have to keep doing it
95:57
this isn't a one-time thing you do it
95:59
every day you be strategic make a list
96:01
you know what where do you send them
96:03
wherever the army of darkness is doing
96:08
something especially wherever you go
96:12
send them before you every day even when
96:14
you're on vacation when you're going
96:16
into a meeting to decide if you're gonna
96:18
get the loan or not send the host in
96:20
there to give you favor they'll speak to
96:23
the people like this I like these people
96:25
I'm just gonna say yes I'm really
96:28
serious they will give you favor they
96:31
will open doors for you doesn't this
96:34
sound like a wonderful plan they will
96:39
you can send them to your College your
96:42
students College wreak havoc on health
96:45
what he'll have a bad day let the
96:49
professor's be confounded by the words
96:52
that come out of your child's mouth
96:54
they'll have to give them favor even if
96:56
they don't like them even if they don't
96:57
know them you won't get attacked by
97:01
people bombarding you with hell when you
97:03
go in to sign into the lobby if a people
97:05
used to tell me all the time am I to go
97:06
to the restaurant and get attacked by
97:08
people that the clerk doesn't like me
97:10
that the waitress doesn't like me the
97:12
hotel clerk just crushed me we'll send
97:14
the host before you go in there don't
97:18
ever buy land well setting the host into
97:20
the deal we're sending you I command you
97:23
to go in there you find out anything
97:25
that's not legal that's not right you
97:27
expose it let me know if it's okay I'm
97:30
getting that deal that's why they're
97:33
here who wouldn't want to live like that
97:37
say in heaven they have no problems
97:43
they're never turned on or rejected they
97:47
never have traffic jams everyone chose
97:51
them favor on earth as it is in heaven
97:56
and he even made that possible why not
98:01
30 years ago because this is the time he
98:03
chose to call the kingdom age when we
98:06
would visibly be seen operating in that
98:10
spiritual Kingdom there proof will be
98:12
our life how it is live what we are able
98:15
to have that's the proof it works and I
98:20
had to live every single bit of this
98:22
then I'm telling you if you're married
98:25
this is a free tip please love each
98:30
other
98:30
my husband would laugh every time you'd
98:33
hear me say this and since he knows that
98:36
he really uses it all the time the Holy
98:39
Spirit came to me and he said these were
98:43
lacking anything this is what you do
98:45
when the love goes out the supply comes
98:49
in if you're not loving you're not gonna
98:53
get supply so if you want something love
98:56
even more I'm talking about between
98:57
husband and wife you know what I'm
99:00
talking about say Amen yeah stop making
99:04
war by fighting and start loving and
99:08
make warfare there's like three things I
99:11
have a CD back that are called
99:13
passionate power it is powerful when you
99:18
love one another it's almost the highest
99:19
level of warfare you can make for your
99:21
children for your marriage for your
99:24
finances if you're mad at each other
99:27
loose it from your soul and bind the
99:31
love of God the passion of God for your
99:34
spouse to your soul it'll change your
99:36
marriage in every way all three of these
99:40
things if you live them as a lifestyle
99:42
you will never fail the enemy will be
99:46
terrified at you hell would not want to
99:48
be around you but the host will love
99:51
living with you
99:54
so if you wanted to do that stand up
99:59
leave without that army and I want to
100:02
tell you this you can get strategic and
100:05
make a list and even when the Isis were
100:07
everywhere my favorite thing to do is I
100:10
would command my host to go boating on
100:13
the Strongs the strongholds of Satan
100:15
commanding the ISIS and fear would fall
100:18
on them and then I would say go house
100:21
that the ISIS have a severe crisis and
100:26
they begin to find weapons abandoned in
100:29
the desert in the Mideast they didn't
100:32
know what happened
100:33
the ISIS would drop their weapons and
100:35
run because my host went there they
100:39
pulled down all the demonic controlling
100:42
them it's always about the spirit of
100:44
darkness I didn't fight against the
100:47
flesh I was fighting with the army
100:49
against the spiritual darkness they pull
100:51
down the strongholds those those those
100:53
Isis had no power from Satan because
100:56
they couldn't hear they were removed
100:59
fear and confusion falls on them even in
101:03
games the same thing happens and gangs
101:06
and Marauders and all kinds of drug
101:10
lords and human trafficking everyone
101:12
doing heaven human traffic ministry they
101:14
need to have an army wherever evil is
101:18
you can send them but especially around
101:22
you your household your family your
101:25
close friends I send them all the time
101:27
and the Wyss White House I went there in
101:32
person and I asked for sentinels to be
101:36
posted all the way down Pennsylvania
101:38
Avenue all the way through them all
101:42
through the through the Capitol Hill all
101:44
the way up to the White House to protect
101:47
Trump
101:49
this was before the election and I saw
101:53
them visibly being posted there to
101:57
protect and keep him and his family and
102:00
pens and his family because pence will
102:03
be our president after Tonks terms two
102:07
terms are up and they already have the
102:11
host all around them you can post them
102:15
places and so there's a protocol
102:18
wouldn't you invite them so if you want
102:20
to do that we're going to choose to
102:21
invite them say I choose with my will to
102:26
invite the host of heaven to be my
102:30
mighty weapon I receive them in Jesus
102:35
name Amen
102:38
well now you all have 100 members if
102:42
you're both sided you have 200 if you're
102:46
children I said it with you we have 10
102:48
year olds a command an army from heaven
102:50
10 and 8 year olds that command their
102:53
army is probably into the millions by
102:55
now because they've been doing it for
102:56
years they're growing up knowing these
103:00
truths they lose stuff from their soul
103:02
they asked for grace every morning
103:04
they're living already on earth says
103:06
they live in what are they going to be
103:07
like when they're 40
103:10
relentless against the enemy speaking to
103:15
the mountains and their cast into the
103:17
sea that's what they'll be doing and no
103:21
one can tell them that you can't do that
103:23
they didn't argue in their mind about it
103:26
they didn't say oh no that is not
103:28
scriptural I don't want to write No
103:30
my pastor doesn't teach that no I'm not
103:32
going to do that I don't believe that I
103:33
said you can choose it or you can die
103:36
because then this time there is great
103:39
darkness being loosed on the earth great
103:40
deception great darkness but when you
103:42
live on earth as they live in heaven it
103:44
won't touch you so we are now going to
103:47
send our armies you say Jesus I take
103:56
power over all the power of the enemy
104:01
attacking me my family my household my
104:08
finances my body my destiny I command
104:15
the hosts of heaven to go right now hold
104:22
on every stronghold
104:24
of Darkness shred every platform the
104:29
enemy's been ruling from for years
104:33
against me and my family and I command
104:38
them you trash those demons you bash
104:43
those demons you throw them in a dry
104:46
place and have fun doing it
104:51
go home make toast
104:55
I can tell you they sing they sing while
105:09
they do it
105:10
because they have been waiting for ages
105:12
to do this oh they whistle they whistle
105:21
and if I'm really ticked off with the
105:23
enemy I'll tell them to spit on them and
105:25
then I'll say tell them I sent you
105:29
I wanted them to know that I sent them
105:39
we're supposed to we're supposed to
105:42
commend we are not under hell's foot
105:47
hell is our doormat we are not doormats
105:54
[Applause]
105:56
when it says turn the other cheek that
105:59
doesn't mean you stand and let them beat
106:00
you to the ground
106:01
that means you decide not to blast them
106:04
back God didn't ever say to us tolerate
106:10
sin beating you up I'm talking about
106:12
humans now he never said that and as a
106:14
matter of fact in marriage he never told
106:17
the husband or the wife that you had to
106:20
tolerate sin in their lives they're
106:23
running around if they're beating you
106:25
that is sin he didn't say to submit to
106:29
their sins if they're doing that it's
106:33
okay to leave if it's your property tell
106:36
them to leave
106:37
I had a face-to-face encounter with
106:40
Jesus Christ telling me that I was I was
106:43
married once before a long time ago was
106:45
a big mistake wasn't God's choice
106:47
and for six and a half years I was beat
106:50
up with words and crushed almost to
106:52
nothing and in this is a believer I was
106:55
married to and I never asked God so
106:58
finally he he walks to the wall of my
107:00
been home and says and I finally said to
107:04
God what do I do about it and so he
107:06
walks through the wall he goes now
107:07
you're asking me you're asking me now
107:12
because that was not my choice he said
107:16
so you go break your contract this part
107:19
really surprised me go break your
107:21
contract you made with him because the
107:23
word says what God has joined together
107:27
let not man put asunder it didn't say
107:32
anything about one man put together and
107:37
people are getting married everywhere
107:39
all day no love there's no love a
107:45
covenant is between you and God loving
107:48
one another honoring one another not
107:52
beating some up like a doormat or you
107:54
want to take advantage of them or you
107:56
think they're going to make your life
107:58
easier that is not a wise thing to do
108:00
because your life will be miserable
108:02
it'll be like you're in prison and then
108:04
it will end up being not good at all no
108:08
if you didn't know I can hear people's
108:10
thoughts if you didn't know about that
108:12
and you have a wonderful marriage of
108:13
somebody even if they're not a believer
108:15
then let them remain that's what the
108:18
word says right it's going to honor God
108:21
if they're gonna love you if they're
108:22
going to love you and and you don't have
108:25
they're not sinning all over the place
108:26
then they can state God will accept that
108:29
marriage but for me he had somebody and
108:34
he said this is what the Lord said to me
108:36
if you do not break that contract and
108:38
end that contract and you'll have to go
108:40
repent to him when you said you loved
108:42
him you did those marriage vows you
108:43
didn't mean them you'll have to repent
108:46
and I did I went to repent you see the
108:49
blender at me not him
108:50
do the blender at me and I ended the
108:53
contract and then I didn't want anybody
108:55
I didn't want anybody and God said no I
108:59
have somebody for you
109:01
and is absolutely necessary for you to
109:03
marry them if you're going to complete
109:04
your destiny because with the other one
109:05
you would have never completed it I
109:07
could understand why I wasn't doing
109:10
anything wrong
109:11
I just didn't ask that's an important
109:14
thing to know if it's God amen
109:17
and if you both were not saved at the
109:19
time you got married God will still
109:20
honor that but when you know who better
109:24
and you should have asked so when I met
109:27
him oh man was he good luck oh he still
109:31
is
109:31
we've married 40 years when I met him he
109:40
didn't know who Moses was he didn't
109:44
didn't know anything you probably better
109:46
he didn't have any religious baggage
109:48
number one that's what God said oh no
109:50
he'll become a mighty man of God but you
109:52
are marrying him because you get your
109:54
place where you let God tell you what to
109:56
do if you've died then he tells you what
109:58
to do and if you obey it's gonna be good
110:01
he said no your marrying him I picked
110:03
him when you were still in me you have
110:06
to have him to complete your destiny and
110:08
you will produce holy seed and I need
110:13
that holy seed that's what this is this
110:14
is my conversation with God no you're
110:17
gonna marry him you will have three
110:18
daughters and I need that holy seed in
110:21
the earth so you go tell him yes because
110:25
he wanted six kids and I had told him no
110:27
and I went God said go yep she said go
110:31
do a deal with him he actually did
110:37
he said he loves you so much and will
110:42
always love you so you go do a deal with
110:44
him and you tell him you'll have three
110:46
[Laughter]
110:49
doesn't it sound like a divine thing you
110:54
go tell him you're gonna marry me buddy
110:55
but you'll only have three and they're
110:56
gonna be spread apart and and there was
111:00
one more thing you said to tell him and
111:01
he'll always buy me disposable diapers
111:05
because I had changed diapers on twelve
111:08
of my siblings coming up cloth diapers
111:12
hanging him on the line in Florida where
111:13
I got it would rain every 15 minutes
111:15
they would get mildewed you'd have to
111:17
take them down like eight clotheslines
111:19
I'm talking about eight clothes on
111:21
take them down stick them in a wringer
111:23
washer and right when they go through
111:26
the wringer my brothers are still a bug
111:28
on there I had seven brothers there's
111:32
almost nothing you can say that it's
111:34
going to bother me okay and I had seven
111:38
sisters does a lot of drama he made sure
111:43
I was dead before I left home so I said
111:48
yes and we got married and I I was madly
111:55
in love with him I mean I want to
111:57
encourage everybody here if you've never
111:58
married don't marry do not marry
112:00
somebody you can live with marry someone
112:04
you cannot live without
112:08
the more modest air the more love you
112:12
have each other the greater chance you
112:14
have of it surviving but now that you
112:16
know about loosing from your soul if
112:19
when have you upset each other home in
112:21

114:03
a massive range so I'll have the whole
114:04

114:09
passion if you mean the best barbecue in
114:11
your city you'll have a restaurant and
114:14
serve the best barbecue in heaven it's
114:17
what you've always wanted to do it is
114:19
you well yes is a fisherman oh the
114:25
hunters oh you can still hunt in heaven
114:30
but you do it with like a scope it's a
114:32
camera scope looks like a gun but it's
114:34
just a camera and the way you capture
114:37
something is on the image the image if
114:39
you can see them in the mountain of
114:41
spices you'll go backpacking up there on
114:44
your horses the horses are laughing at
114:46
you the whole time because they know
114:48
you're never gonna find the creatures
114:50
that you're hunting and the creatures if
114:53
they capture you first with the scope
114:56
you go back to their club and there's a
115:00
massive screen like 30 feet 30 feet 30
115:03
feet and there will be your picture and
115:05
then the car will be the creature that
115:07
captured you
115:09
[Applause]
115:12
so nobody guys but it becomes very
115:17
intense extremely and rarely has a human
115:24
being ever captured these creatures and
115:26
so they're determined I'm gonna be the
115:28
first one and they go well I think I got
115:30
some I'm pretty sure I got some yeah
115:32
then you show up and there's your
115:33
picture plastered all over the big train
115:38
heaven is exciting amen
115:43
so I hope you've grown and you've
115:46
learned and you said yes if you do those
115:50
three things then you will live on earth
115:53
that's they live in heaven but it is a
115:55
lifestyle and the more you send the army
115:59
it doesn't have to be just for you
116:01
it can be for family members friends
116:03
missionary groups and if you hear
116:06
something going on if there's a war in
116:07
another country you literally can send
116:09
your army to pull down the darkness
116:11
controlling that whole army and if you
116:13
get people to come together we know
116:15
people who come together once a week and
116:17
strategically send their armies together
116:19
it's devastating it's devastating the
116:23
hell's planes amen
116:25
the more you sound the more you get they
116:30
get multiplied like you don't get
116:32
another hundred if you've been sending
116:34
them for a whole week you'll get 10,000
116:36
then it goes to a million and I've been
116:40
doing it probably around five years or
116:41
so I have 33 billion that I send
116:47
everywhere all the time
116:49
I do sweeps of host states to expose
116:52
every every group of human trafficking
116:55
drug trafficking violence witchcraft
116:59
whatever it is I send them they do is
117:02
sweep cuz I'm gonna make Florida a
117:05
region of light
117:07
[Applause]
117:08
Colorado yeah
117:12
Bessie Denver's ending in the Denver all
117:14
the time you can even send them into the
117:17
laws that they're gonna make that you
117:20
don't want or even after they have been
117:22
made the hosts can go influence the
117:27
people who are over those laws or they
117:29
can expose all the crime that's being
117:32
done because of those laws and they'll
117:35
realize we should have never done this
117:36
you can use it in Congress in your own
117:40
city government in the state government
117:42
and I certainly sent them throughout the
117:46
entire election and the midterm
117:50
elections end every voting booth to
117:55
speak to the people in the voting booth
117:58
they vote for life freedom and justice
118:03
and they will go and they'll come back
118:08
quickly so be strategic the more you
118:11
send the more you get amen and and they
118:14
know it works and we get things from all
118:18
over the world the people that are doing
118:19
this that their lives are never been the
118:21
same so we're gonna live on Earth as we
118:24
live in heaven amen
118:25

122:54
them against darkness every day of your
122:56
life don't forget to ask for grace and
122:59
don't keep anything in you that you
123:02
don't want so let's stand up it'll be
123:04
the last thing we do we're gonna have a
123:06
soul checkup right now we're gonna get
123:11
it done it's like anything else you have
123:15
to choose with your will to do this and
123:18
we know people I tried it didn't work I
123:20
said you didn't really mean it
123:21
they're wanting to be free from
123:23
cigarettes and you can be we've had a
123:25
lot of people be free from that but they
123:27
still wanted them and they still smoked
123:30
them and what well you know if you want
123:33
to give it up you're actually supposed
123:34
to say no if that comes back to you and
123:37
the enemy will try you you just say no
123:39
and so I said well I'm still not sure
123:41
about that but we've had a lot of people
123:43
set free from all kinds of things like
123:45
we talked about including homosexuality
123:47
which is not of God it's the devil
123:50
perverting the image of God because we
123:53
are made in His image
123:55
everyone in Genesis 1:26 was the
123:58
everyone God ever made we were made in
124:01
His image and after his likeness so
124:05
anything that doesn't line up with that
124:06
is something that Satan got into he
124:10
wants to destroy images he wants to
124:11
destroy destinies and I pray they
124:14
actually call me they call me and ask me
124:16
how to be free and they go even though I
124:19
say this is okay I'm talking about the
124:20
homosexuals even though I will tell
124:22
people I love this and I'm doing great
124:24
they're not they said I suffer inside my
124:27
soul fights with me all the time I don't
124:31
know why it fights and when it because
124:33
God put things in you before he sent you
124:36
and it's not agreeing with what you're
124:39
choosing and they said well no I mean I
124:42
really want to go to heaven cuz even
124:44
though I say this is OK inside I know
124:47
it's not OK so no matter what they say
124:50
they know deep inside it's not it's not
124:53
right and so I just take him through the
124:55
word about showing them about the image
124:57
of God and and how he lived in God and
124:59
what his plans are for us and they get
125:01
saved they pray and they get saved
125:03
and then they loosen because then it
125:06
never they don't feel like that anymore
125:07
amen
125:08
so we're gonna choose to lose all kinds
125:11
of things from our soul and then when
125:13
we're done with that we will bind the
125:15
things of God to our soul and you can
125:17
say you had a soul checkup
125:18
but you can actually teach other people
125:20
how to do soul checkups especially
125:23
people you know that are broken are
125:24
really sad they're in fear they need to
125:27
loose that from their self almost
125:28
everything being displayed from people
125:30
99% of the time it is what is in their
125:33
soul as you think it's in your soul so
125:38
are you so people are angry all the time
125:40
or they're in fear they feel unworthy
125:43
unworthiness you know they could have a
125:46
spirit of infirmity you can even lose
125:49
them from your soul and they'll be gone
125:52
so we're gonna say I choose as an act to
125:56
my will and a child of God I lose for my
126:02
soul
126:04
all fear all anger all unworthiness all
126:12

131:18
of your life what would happen you would
131:24
be walking on air that's when the
131:29
greater works if you weren't here the
131:33
other day I talked about how that
131:34
actually just happened to me in Reno of
131:36
all places
131:37
and Reno I just stepped off of the stuff
131:40
and didn't realize it and I literally
131:42
walk down there about this far off the
131:44
ground my sisters like freaking out
131:46
behind me no Mike I'm what I'm like I
131:52
look Turnham like I was standing on air
131:54
and so I say to the father Wow father is
131:59
that as good as walking on water and he
132:02
goes no it's a greater work water you
132:06
can feel the air you can't feel he said
132:12
you better get used to that because
132:15
you'll be doing it it's a manifested
132:18
daughter of God amen if you see the
132:22
rainbow coming out of your head that's
132:24
the image of God if your eyes become
132:27
flames of fire that's the Lord's image
132:30
and the father's image if you have
132:34
gemstones appear on your skin which
132:36
might sound weird you but everybody in
132:39
heaven wears them on them they come from
132:44
the Father they come from his heart he
132:47
has them all so it's one of his images
132:51
gemstones in heaven are so extremely
132:54
valuable because they all come from the
132:55
heart of God they're put on your robes
132:58
of righteousness there in your walkways
133:00
up to you of your home I was in
133:02
someone's home and I saw massive
133:03
gemstones which was what they were they
133:05
had on the on their table as decorations
133:08
decor for this table that probably
133:10
seated like I don't know I've been in
133:12
homes
133:13
a hundred people the dining room I'm
133:15
talking about in someone's home but I've
133:17
been in one even bigger than that
133:19
this one had about baby 460 people and
133:21
the drapes on the windows were so sheer
133:24
they were moving they were living and
133:26
they had pearls this big on the end of
133:28
all the drapes their chandelier was 50
133:31
feet long in their dining room and it
133:35
was real gemstones all from the heart of
133:37
God and their glory was reflected
133:40
because all over the ground reflects the
133:42
glory the sky has the glory the
133:45
buildings are filled with the glory of
133:46
God if you walk and live in the glory of
133:49
God you live you live in the glory down
133:57
here we are practicing because up there
134:01
it will be your life you come in your
134:05
mansion and the mansion will speak to
134:07
you and say welcome home even your
134:13
mansion knows you knows your name the
134:16
disciples will come and greet you
134:18
they'll come and move in for a while
134:19
King David will come and take you in his
134:22
own chariot across the skies of heaven
134:24
on a tour of heaven you go see Paul who
134:27
sits in this garden all the time and all
134:29
you're talking about is the epistles but
134:31
when he gives the epistles he's given
134:32
what happened in the spirit realm your
134:34
HOH testimony changes because you get to
134:36

135:27
about and people will go in they laugh
135:30

00:00
[Music]
00:03
everyone this is my husband captain me
00:16
first time he's been here I'm excited
00:19
man
00:25
can you hear me
00:28
[Music]
00:34
make sure this is on
00:36
it's on now I just had to push that back
00:39
nine
00:40
okay we're on well the time of my
00:45
message tonight is time for freedom if
00:50
you wonder why all the time a lot of
00:53
confirmations on that from God he said
00:55
it's time for freedom so that's the
00:57
title of the message for us to operate
01:00
your freedom in our own personal lives
01:03
and our country especially in America it
01:08
is time for freedom for the body of
01:10
Christ it is time for freedom it's the
01:15
time to rule and freedom amen because we
01:21
all know that the truth will make us
01:24
[Music]
01:27
free indeed and that's really what time
01:31
it is in our lives and especially all
01:34
those who came here tonight you will
01:36
leave with a deposit of heavens freedom
01:39
in you amen and my notebook is blank
01:46
it's here to hang on to I guess I tell
01:51
people if you're gonna talk about having
01:53
an you've been there you don't need
01:54
notes because you will never forget it
01:57
never if you had a dream so vivid ten
02:01
years later you remember if it was in
02:03
heaven then you probably were there a
02:05
lot of people don't know you're taking
02:07
even in your sleep your spirit man can
02:10
be taken in your sleep and that dream is
02:12
so vivid you recount everything about it
02:14
what it felt like the music the aromas
02:18
the experience of just touching heavens
02:20
ground being in the throne room a lot of
02:24
places in heaven and heaven is coming
02:27
and invading this earth
02:30
you know the body will pick up and hear
02:33
something from heaven and they'll say
02:35
that for years and then it actually
02:37
happens and so this is the time for it
02:40
to happen
02:41
heaven is converging with this earth
02:44
that means a lot will change in our
02:46
lives that means we need to start living
02:48
on earth like they live in heaven that's
02:51
called heaven culture heaven has their
02:53
own culture trust me every when you move
02:56
there they know that their life is
02:59
radically different and their existing
03:03
to live down here we have to kind of
03:07
exist sometimes except in this time we
03:09
actually can live in the past you know
03:11
you have to take have a living in your
03:14
life in order to exist you had to make a
03:16
living right but in this time it's time
03:19
to exist to live if we can live on this
03:23
earth like they do in heaven and heaven
03:25
is invading this earth and are all of
03:27
our senses are being brought alive
03:29
moving into manifest and I'm sitting
03:31
there and God says there'll be
03:32
manifestation and demonstration there'll
03:36
be signs and wonders you know there's
03:38
all kinds of things that they're saying
03:40
about this time on the earth and we
03:42
should all be able to experience them
03:44
and actually help make them happen you
03:49
know when Christ was here he was a
03:51
living example for the disciples he was
03:54
training them the whole time he walked
03:57
in his life those last three years of
03:59
his life everything you did or said that
04:01
was training for the disciples well I
04:04
come to Train I'm not here to give you a
04:08
nice word I'm not here to give a nice
04:10
message that might tickle you a little
04:12
bit I'm here to change you to Revelation
04:17
manifestation demonstration signs and
04:21
wonders and I know some of that will
04:24
come from heaven itself but really it's
04:26
because heaven is invading us it's us we
04:29
it is our turn right now to manifest for
04:33
heaven in this earth you know we're
04:35
putting on the show say we're putting on
04:37
a show
04:38
and the show has begun we are the third
04:43
show the first one was the father the
04:48
second one was Christ in hell on the
04:51
third day well we are the third show
04:53
being put on in this earth amen he's
04:56
going to show up and show off in us that
05:00
is a show so if you had if you had a lot
05:06
of showman in you you're ready you are
05:09
so ready a lot of the body has to be
05:12
transitioned into being a very open
05:14
person expressive person doesn't matter
05:17
what anyone says or you know sees about
05:20
them
05:20
God isn't hiding us anymore he's not
05:25
hiding us time for the body of Christ to
05:28
come out of the closet and let the world
05:34
see us operating on the stoats just like
05:38
they do in heaven we're supposed to
05:41
manifest the image of the Living God and
05:44
if you're ready for that you should be
05:47
saying to the father I want to look like
05:50
you and act like you and singing to his
05:53
son I want to look like you and act like
05:56
you and even the Holy Spirit I want to
05:59
look like you and act like you we will
06:03
fulfill Genesis 1:26 what God said let
06:07
us make man in our image there you go
06:10
look like them and operate like them
06:13
their likeness is how they operate
06:17
that's revelation on that scripture
06:20
people think why are they saying the
06:21
same thing twice they're not when you
06:24
begin to understand heavens language
06:26
they can say something to something
06:28
similar to the next word but those are
06:30
always going to be two different things
06:31
their image and their likeness are two
06:35
different things
06:36
their likeness is literally how they
06:40
operate so worse was the operating on
06:44
this earth on this earth like they are
06:46
in heaven that means you may have a
06:49
manifestation
06:50
manifestation is something supernatural
06:52
that people haven't seen before coming
06:55
from you
06:56
I have already had four manifestations
07:03
knew never done before coming from me as
07:06
demonstration of the Living God just
07:10
because I started telling him I want to
07:13
look just like you
07:14
so they've seen the rainbow moving in
07:17
and out of my head say God as the
07:21
father's image isn't it they've seen
07:27
that they've seen my eyes become flames
07:30
of fire amen like my pupils are flames
07:34
of fire and this was just in the last
07:37
few months this has started happening
07:38
and the third thing is that I was just
07:44
in my products table like saying hi to
07:46
people and the father had warned me at
07:48
any time because they gave permission I
07:52
want you all to say this I give
07:53
permission anytime anywhere you want to
08:00
you may demonstrate through me and I yes
08:06
you need to mean that when you say that
08:10
father anytime anywhere you choose I
08:19
give you permission to demonstrate
08:24
through me
08:26
who you are and Jesus Christ I give you
08:31
permission Holy Spirit I give you
08:35
permission to demonstrate and manifest
08:40
through me your image and the way you
08:44
operate so be it
08:47
I receive it amen I'm gonna take a
08:55
minute and remind you of some of the
08:58
things some of the images that Christ
09:00
took on this earth his eyes were flames
09:04
of fire he walked on water he made food
09:08
created food amen he traveled in the
09:12
spirit realm and controlled time because
09:15
it's Ellery them they stepped in the
09:17
boat they were there that's one of the
09:21
things that he did is one of the ways he
09:23
operated he raised the dead even after
09:26
they were stinking he terrified the
09:31
demonic all the time
09:34
amen he walked on water are you willing
09:42
to do that the Holy Spirit the Holy
09:48
Spirit one of his images is littered
09:50
becoming a flame of fire it was a flame
09:54
of fire that couldn't be quenched
09:55
couldn't put out he showed up in the
09:57
upper room and boy did he have drama
10:03
drama comes with him he is called the
10:06
drama king in heaven just wait and see
10:10
what's going to happen he was invisible
10:16
everybody say
10:19
one of the ways he operated yet he had
10:23
many things that represented him in his
10:26
image that he used in this earth a man
10:28
and the father the living rainbow moving
10:34
in and out of him it's not just a
10:38
rainbow it's alive moves in and out like
10:40
this in waves all the time in heaven in
10:44
and out of him that's who John saw in
10:46
the book of Revelation in chapter 4 he
10:50
saw him sitting on the throne with a
10:52
rainbow like unto an emerald you notice
10:57
he didn't say just like an emerald
10:59
because he didn't have a word for teal
11:04
teal is the father's favorite color and
11:09
those bands coming out of him can be
11:12
like that can be one full band that goes
11:15
from him to the walls of the throne room
11:17
it could be like red or blue or blue
11:21
green teal it could be purple it can be
11:25
blue and a red mixed together whenever
11:28
those rainbow that rainbow comes out of
11:30
him when you're in the throne room you
11:32
could have been there seven different
11:33
times and that rainbow was a different
11:35
color every time everyone in this in the
11:38
throne room would turn that color it
11:41
would saturate them and turn them that
11:43
color say that's the father's image
11:52
there are cosmic waves I call cosmic
11:55
waves like I think to me the biggest
11:57
greatest thing is like cosmic it's
12:00
bigger than all the cosmos out there he
12:03
has waves to come through from him love
12:06
I'm telling you the greatest love come
12:09
from him and then the glory when the
12:11
glory comes you hear it has a frequency
12:14
the love and and the glory of God and
12:17
the peace of God they have a frequency
12:20
that comes with him and I've been in
12:22
there before one like this wave like
12:24
continue like a shock wave would come
12:26
from him and it would go like mmm mmm I
12:30
can't even make the sound it was so loud
12:32
and it would penetrate everybody in
12:34
there all the way around him and they
12:36
would get they would get thrown to the
12:37
floor that's that's one of the ways he
12:41
operates it is he also has flames of
12:46
fire his flames the fire are blue his
12:48
pupils are literally flames of fire and
12:51
the glory comes something so great if
12:54
you stand in front of him long enough
12:56
you'll see these flames of fire that are
12:58
his eyes it's one of his images so all
13:04
these amazing images are these images in
13:07
the way they operate from the father
13:08
from his son from the holy spirit he is
13:12
a whirlwind I've seen him come in many
13:14
times as a whirlwind sometimes he was a
13:17
whirlwind of the rainbow and he come and
13:20
he he would be like you know kind of
13:22
invisible but he's actually big he's
13:24
actually got a body arms legs a head or
13:27
you wouldn't have one they all do the
13:31
Father the Son Holy Spirit all have an
13:33
actual body because we're made in there
13:37
or you wouldn't have on those images are
13:44
manifested in different ways and of
13:46
course the Holy Spirit also in the image
13:49
of a dove that was not just a little
13:52
dove with feathers that Dove had
13:55
feathers what were made out of flames
13:56
the fire when he came down and was over
14:00
Christ when John was going to baptize
14:03
him
14:03
remember when he baptized him and that
14:05
dove came down and then they heard the
14:07
voice of the Father declaring who his
14:11
son was and he was pleased in him and so
14:15
they have a voice there's another thing
14:17
about their voice haven't experienced
14:19
that yet I've heard it when it talks in
14:22
the Bible that it was sounded like many
14:24
thunders or many waters because they
14:28
didn't have like today's language to
14:31
interpret that he has his voice is
14:34
layered there's layers in his voice
14:38
that's why it sounds like many many
14:40
thunders or many waters he literally has
14:43
layers in his voice expect that to
14:44
happen to you one day when you get up to
14:46
speak and people are shook they're just
14:49
shook to the core when the hearing
14:50
speaking is like layered like many
14:53
saying it instead of one this is his
14:57
this is one of the images this is this
14:59
is one of the images that they and the
15:00
likeness that they operate in so if
15:02
we're supposed to be just like them you
15:04
better be ready for any of these things
15:05
to manifest to you okay just the works
15:10
of Christ was shocking to people but the
15:13
greater works then he is reserved for
15:16
this time there's time again this is a
15:21
different time if you've never heard
15:24
that said you're not living in the same
15:27
spiritual time that we did even a few
15:30
years ago because I've been talking
15:33
about this for a lot of years a lot of
15:37
many years I've been talking about all
15:39
this happening and you know but God has
15:41
on this timeline a time when that starts
15:44
and we're not waiting on that time
15:47
anymore we are in that time we're in
15:51
that time where we will stand out and
15:53
stand up and show off
15:56
you can you stayed up and you can you
15:58
know you need to wake up and stand up
16:00
and that's nice
16:03
but standing out and showing off is a
16:06
whole different thing that's when you
16:08
can't hide and you'll never be able to
16:11
hide again because God has marked you
16:15
for greatness if you're alive in this
16:19
time even those who don't know him you
16:22
know some of them are marked for
16:23
greatness and so we need to believe and
16:26
have faith and hope for everybody no
16:29
matter how wicked they are God right now
16:32
in this time is moving on the hearts of
16:36
very wicked people he really is and you
16:42
may not see Christ coming from them at
16:45
the time but you'll see a major change
16:46
in the way that they talk and they live
16:50
like the North Korean president
16:58
if people don't realize there is a major
17:00
change in that man that didn't just
17:07
happen for any reason that was God's
17:09
plan he had a plan I'll either change
17:14
him or remove him off the face of the
17:15
earth and many leaders and countries
17:19
right now are in that place because God
17:22
is trying to align as many countries as
17:25
he can to agree with his plan and those
17:29
countries will prosper beyond measure
17:32
because they've heard him and they are
17:35
shifting God is right now shifting she's
17:40
shifting governments to shape that
17:42
nation Korea is going to be shaped by
17:46
God by God as America is right now we're
17:53
being shifted right now do you haven't
17:57
noticed
17:59
in the shifting process all of Hell will
18:02
be exposed people no matter how high up
18:11
the ladder they have gotten if they're a
18:14
wicked if they have a wicked agenda and
18:16
they've been hiding it it will be
18:18
exposed and those who are in leadership
18:23
or in our government or even in big
18:26
business this includes big business - it
18:28
even includes the church those who are
18:32
hiding lying sinning and thinking that
18:36
they could stand here and give the Word
18:39
of God and speak on his behalf if they
18:41
think they can do that anymore not in
18:43
this time they will not and the Spirit
18:47
of God is really moving on the hearts of
18:49
those that are doing it so they don't
18:51
die I'm just as serious about that is
18:57
all the rest because there this is a
19:00
time that's so important to God that
19:02
he's removing all the roadblocks he's
19:05
removing all of the weights anything
19:08
that has held us back to be able to
19:10
prosper to have a voice to have a
19:12
platform everywhere to speak on his
19:15
behalf whether is the business arena the
19:17
governmental arena arts and
19:19
entertainment arena news and media arena
19:21
he's moving on the hearts of people and
19:23
he is shifting even in those different
19:26
arenas you're gonna see major changes in
19:31
all of those arenas when God's gonna do
19:35
something new he always sends a a
19:37
messenger or messengers and they have
19:41
revelation in them the messenger if it's
19:45
about heaven or time or God they have to
19:48
have revelation in them that's not
19:51
something that came from their own mind
19:53
never in my life did I set a time
19:56
thinking I was gonna do any of this I
19:59
had my plan
20:02
me Father Son and Holy Spirit and a nice
20:07
little you know executive apartment
20:09
somewhere moving and shaking the
20:11
business world that was my plan so what
20:15
does he do
20:16
remove me totally completely out of the
20:18
business world well that took that off
20:20
his plan off my plan my plan that was
20:23
gone it was just gonna be me did you get
20:25
that me not a husband not children me
20:30
father said in Holy Spirit
20:32
well that was wiped off you know that
20:34
was quite tough of my plan I obviously
20:36
got married I I have three beautiful
20:42
children that God said they were holy
20:46
seed and he informed me because a long
20:51
time ago I gave him my life he informed
20:54
me you are marrying him he did not ask
20:59
me when you get the place what God is
21:02
telling you that is significant because
21:06
you're not going to fight against your
21:07
gonna say okay yeah I gave you a
21:08
permission which you did tonight and he
21:14
started a 40-year plan on me to prepare
21:18
me for what he was gonna do with me he
21:20
even took me out of my wonderful job I
21:23
had there was high paying and I loved it
21:28
so I thought well you know I'm married
21:30
but I can still work in the business
21:31
world and I loved it I've worked over 25
21:34
years in the business world well he
21:35
wiped that off from my plan by getting
21:38
me fired
21:41
he's gonna make sure I left but he was
21:45
kind enough to tell me 30 days before it
21:48
happened in 30 days you will not be
21:51
working there anymore I was working in a
21:55
law at a nice job with a Christian
21:58
lawyer which was a miracle Oh a
22:01
Christian comedian lawyer which was a
22:03
double miracle so I had a lot of fun I
22:07
love my job enjoyed it didn't know a
22:09
thing about law but was trained in
22:11
business law estate and probate and tax
22:15
law and real estate which I didn't know
22:17
a thing about it and he still hired me
22:18
that's called favor that's also called
22:22
God's plan so he really did he got me
22:26
and shifted me everywhere and then I had
22:30
my three daughters that was a big
22:33
surprise but he also told me that you're
22:38
gonna marry him you'll have a three
22:40
girls and I need them all so you will
22:45
say yes to him because I would say nope
22:46
see one at six
22:51
and I am one of 15 at the not the very
22:56
top if you've never been part of a big
22:58
family especially one of the older ones
23:00
you don't know what dying is you die
23:04
every day so I hope to raise 12 of my
23:07
siblings and now he's telling me
23:10
remember my plan no husband no children
23:13
just the Trinity and me doing big
23:16
business together and he informed me
23:21
each of these times because from the
23:23
time I was young I could hear him well
23:25
but the more I gave myself to him and
23:27
the more I chose his will his way and
23:32
obey I will tell you right now a very
23:36
important keys right his will his way
23:40
not yours a lot of people on his will
23:43
they do it their way it takes longer
23:46
it'll slow things down you may have to
23:49
start all over again sometimes so I
23:51
decided I'm doing it I'm gonna have I
23:53
want your will your way and then I had
23:56
to obey even when it didn't make sense
23:59
and I promise you he is almost never
24:02
going to make sense one of my friends
24:07
recently made a statement she she
24:09
preaches a lot her family have like
24:11
seven churches everywhere and she's
24:14
blocked so she's got a lot of layers in
24:16
her soul she's extremely expressed that
24:19
she's a lot of fun but she will tell you
24:20
the way it is let me tell you she said
24:23
God always ask you to do things crazy
24:27
things he lets you do crazy things that
24:31
don't make any sense to you but yes for
24:33
the crazy things so that it can bring
24:35
the supernatural what usually doesn't
24:39
make any sense either and I promise you
24:43
she was right on when she said that it's
24:46
almost always crazy doesn't make any
24:48
sense because he is not a man he has his
24:53
own plan right so here is after saying
24:58
all that in all these years he then
24:59
began to tell me okay right now you're
25:01
marrying him you're gonna have three
25:03
girls you can have them five years apart
25:04
if you want to but you're gonna have
25:05
them and then as a baby he showed me the
25:10
destiny of each one of them I saw what
25:14
they would be doing I know what they'll
25:16
be doing for a very long time in their
25:18
in their life need some water
25:22
I'll talk to nothing comes out I don't
25:28
want to waste time so Jesus as one of
25:34
the way he operates he wasn't that
25:36
bombed by time even as a righteous man
25:38
and I like to remind everybody yes he
25:40
was the son of God but he walked and
25:42
lived as a righteous man just like you
25:46
he had to face everything you faced he
25:49
had to make decisions how he was gonna
25:51
respond react what he was gonna allow in
25:53
his soul but he wouldn't allow in his
25:55
soul that he would love instead of hate
25:58
he didn't sin he didn't sin he said no
26:02
to sin he had absolute authority and
26:05
power over all the power of the enemy
26:07
that's why he could give it to us he
26:11
would command the heavens to open did
26:14
you hear me say the word command say a
26:17
righteous man commanded the heavens to
26:21
open and he did that more than once
26:26
are we righteous can we command did he
26:32
command the hosts of heaven that's
26:34
another way he operated the hosts of
26:36
heaven are the armies of heaven and he
26:40
even said when he was on trial if I
26:43
wanted to I could call the army of
26:45
heaven to come and fight on my behalf
26:46
did he say that say as a righteous man
26:50
he said that he commanded when he was on
26:56
this earth he commanded the water to
26:59
turn into wine and that was not normal
27:03
wine he commanded the water to turn into
27:06
heavens wine when that be great for some
27:13
people
27:17
he did that all the time because it
27:19
reminded him of home heavens wine is the
27:24
best wine and that's why they said at
27:27
the wedding you have saved the best for
27:31
last
27:32
never have we ever had wine like this
27:34
before never yeah because it didn't come
27:37
from Earth it came from heaven and have
27:42
news for you Jesus did that at home all
27:43
the time
27:44
that's why Mary knew he could do it
27:48
right she knew that he could turn that
27:52
water into heavens wine he did it when
27:55
he was growing up nobody was ever sick
28:03
in his home while he was there the food
28:06
would all be always be multiplied on the
28:08
table he already operated in these
28:11
things and he knew one day he would step
28:14
out and do them remember what Mary said
28:17
go do whatever he says to do and Jesus
28:20
said are you making me step up before my
28:21
time no Mary knew it was time and when
28:26
they came for him remember when he's
28:27
preaching somewhere and they said your
28:29
mother and your siblings are outside
28:31
asking for you they were not asking him
28:34
to come home and preach say Amen or he
28:40
would have been they would have already
28:41
been in the meetings they missed heavens
28:45
wine they missed the food be multiplied
28:48
they missed
28:49
never been sick because of his presence
28:53
these are things he had to learn and
28:55
grow when he grew up in these but there
28:59
came a time in his life when he knew
29:00
exactly who he was he knew his purpose
29:04
from the earth he had to say yes like we
29:08
had to say yes he had to choose to do
29:12
these things you have to choose to be
29:14
chosen many are called but few are
29:19
chosen because they don't say yes to
29:23
being chosen
29:24
that's why I always say say I'll receive
29:27
it because when you say I received it
29:28
that means you're saying yes I want to
29:29
be chosen I had to choose even though he
29:33
was telling me what to do I still had to
29:35
choose to do I had to obey and the Bible
29:39
says those who are willing and she'll
29:42
eat the fatter the it's a promise in
29:47
this time it's really important to make
29:50
sure that you obey even if it doesn't
29:53
make sense and so I told you there were
29:57
four things he started manifesting in me
29:59
the fourth thing the fourth thing
30:01
happened last weekend when I was in Reno
30:06
Reno Nevada I walked on air remember how
30:13
they operate Jesus walked on water I
30:16
walked on the air and I was quite
30:20
shocked and my sister was behind me we
30:25
were going to the greenroom the pastor
30:27
was in front of me to head into the
30:28
green room and I didn't know that there
30:30
was a drop a step this big come to in
30:33
something there's a big step and then
30:34
you've stepped down I didn't see the
30:35
step I just was going because he was
30:38
beacon to me as he was going forward I'm
30:40
speaking to him while he's walking we're
30:42
both talking to each other and I stepped
30:44
off to step into nothing and it felt
30:49
like nothing if you stepped in water you
30:52
would at least feel the water so I
30:56
stepped off and I kept going and then I
30:58
stepped off with my other foot and I'm
31:00
there and I'm your sister like gas
31:02
behind me and and now we're so shocked
31:05
when I look down on this far off the
31:07
floor in the air this is what is going
31:13
to happen to you
31:18
and if you remember even as even at the
31:22
very end of G's Minh when everything was
31:24
done and he was going to go home
31:25
remember he just went up in the air
31:28
Jesus just went up in the air didn't he
31:30
say he walked down there right before
31:34
mine home so I'm just standing there and
31:38
I'm I said to the father
31:40
this is Myall and when is this sort of I
31:46
actually in my mind was speaking him and
31:48
he was answering me my mind and went is
31:50
this like walking on water he goes oh no
31:52
this is better
31:55
he said when Peter stepped out of the
31:57
boat he could feel the water you aren't
32:00
feeling anything and he said by the way
32:03
you better get used to this like
32:06
whatever you want and so my sister's
32:09
like yeah I'm standing on the urine
32:18
aperture on look at her wonder Stan yeah
32:20
yeah in her face is like and I actually
32:27
dropped my iPad I was so so startled and
32:30
at this point the passage around he goes
32:32
what's going on and the mini said that
32:35
my feet just on the floor and I'm like
32:39
that didn't bother me at all and Django
32:41
you know said why don't you just say I
32:43
was walking on it that sounds a little
32:45
bit better than flow I guess it always
32:48
both okay that was say a manifestation
32:52
of the power of God so all for these
32:58
things that have just started happening
33:00
is because I gave him permission I gave
33:04
him permission now he didn't warn me and
33:07
say oh in the minute you're gonna just
33:09
step on you're gonna walk on there he
33:12
didn't warn me about any of these he
33:13
didn't say oh by the way rainbow is
33:15
gonna start coming out of your head
33:17
moving in and out of your head
33:19
and and I've actually had a few people
33:22
together that saw another person he was
33:24
visiting and they were just talking to
33:25
me and I'm
33:26
in the middle of this kitchen and they
33:28
keep going like this like the tryna
33:30
mommy and I'm like what's wrong he goes
33:33
you have a rainbow that's like coming in
33:37
and out of your hat she tried to look to
33:40
see if it was the lights or was 7
33:41
reflecting and I'm he goes no it's the
33:43
rainbow
33:44
about an hour later he goes there's that
33:46
rainbow again I just totally ignored I
33:48
ignored him you know I thought well I
33:50
don't know what he ate for dinner but
33:52
maybe he's tired
33:54
and then the next weekend I went to a
33:57
church and was speaking and one thing
34:00
God the Father told me personally Jesus
34:03
and the father both told me that at one
34:04
point everybody in the meeting would see
34:06
the angels that are with me because
34:09
we're going to see heaven say we're
34:11
going to see heaven lots of heaven you
34:16
come in one day and see all the angels
34:18
waiting you see yours that came with you
34:20
okay and if any I'm coming to do
34:24
something for heaven Oh God
34:26
then you'll see them too in your mind
34:30
you have to stop thinking that you're
34:33
normal we are not like all the people on
34:39
the earth don't have Jesus their DNA has
34:43
not been changed but yours has and the
34:51
other thing too you better get ready for
34:52
as you actually do have power yourself
34:56
people oh that sounds just too oh no you
35:02
have power yet power because Jesus said
35:07
we did he actually gave it to us all
35:12
these are in the Word of God okay you
35:15
just maybe didn't know that you were
35:17
born in the right time the time that
35:20
you're born in is very strategic for God
35:22
and he will wait to a certain event
35:26
happens when an event happens a fullness
35:29
of time has come and when a bonus of
35:32
timing has come that means things will
35:35
be different in the earth that's also
35:38
scriptural
35:39
a fullness of time has come that means
35:42
the old stuff isn't going to be like
35:43
totally gone away but the way we operate
35:46
will be greater and more powerful than
35:48
the way we used to operate in the old
35:50
time and when when John the Baptist made
35:53
that announcement that certainly a
35:55
fullness of time had come
35:56
amen upon the time came when Christ was
36:00
born in the earth another fullness of
36:01
time came when he was going to step up
36:03
into his ministry was crucified on the
36:06
cross that was another time because
36:09
things would change things change when
36:12
Christ was born and things changed when
36:17
he stepped into his ministry and things
36:19
changed when he was crucified on the
36:21
cross and was rose from the dead major
36:24
changes were made this is the time this
36:28
is the time for the body the manifested
36:32
say manifested sons and daughters to
36:37
stand up and manifest in this earth say
36:43
the earth is crying out and it's shaking
36:46
in travail for us to stand up and speak
36:52
to the earth speak to the air speak to
36:57
the hosts for the impossible to happen
37:03
amen
37:04
the earth is not shaking because it is
37:08
the end and everything is going to be
37:09
all over the people who don't know God's
37:14
timing say it is and all the people in
37:17
the church who don't know this is
37:19
sitting on the rapture rugs because they
37:24
want to escape because it's so awful
37:26
well they will be sitting there forever
37:30
these are some of the greatest times on
37:33
the earth that God has written down and
37:35
he's not going to ignore them but he
37:38
expects us to participate
37:41
not escape participate don't escape
37:46
there's another t-shirt and so many of
37:53
the body think is so horrible and awful
37:56
they can't even when you get stuck in
37:58
that place you can't see the good that
38:00
is happening you have filled your soul
38:03
your own soul with doom and gloom wrath
38:08
and destruction and you can't even see
38:10
or understand this is the day of his
38:12
power not the day of his wrath those are
38:16
two different times we're in the last
38:20
days because we're a lot closer than we
38:22
were thousands of years ago we're in the
38:27
last days but not the last day and major
38:31
things will happen a lot of things have
38:33
to happen before the end of time comes
38:37
many many many things we'll be seeing it
38:41
doing it experiencing it but we aren't
38:45
going to escape it you either you either
38:48
feel it and watch it and sit on the
38:51
sidelines or you'll be in it I'm going
38:54
to be in it
38:56
amen so America right now is in it
39:03
America hasn't been brushed to the side
39:05
by god it's a baby nation it's one of
39:11
the it's one of the youngest nations in
39:12
the earth I mean there's I've recently
39:15
visited nations that were thousands of
39:17
years old I've been to them recently and
39:20
I come back here and there's no place
39:23
like here maybe Israel Israel was
39:28
powerful is a beautiful place filled
39:34
with the Spirit of God millions of
39:37
angels are in Israel they still stand in
39:40
the place where Christ knelt in the
39:41
garden had to drink that cup they're
39:44
still in the upper room and I already
39:46
seen the fiery open we're opening in the
39:48
upper room where the Holy Spirit came in
39:50
and anointed all them and the Holy Ghost
39:53
they're still there they're there even
39:57
over Paul's where he was held in prison
39:59
is an open stairway from heaven he
40:01
created an open heaven in the prison
40:05
it's powerful to see the things that
40:07
remain that we're done by those in the
40:10
past that love God obey God and we're
40:14
going to make a lot of those places
40:15
right now in this earth amen so this is
40:20
this is the time to walk in liberty
40:21
freedom
40:22
right and justice and I recently in Reno
40:27
we all know that Kavanaugh
40:29
I'm very political right now I'm doing
40:32
heavens politics executing God God's
40:36
government on the earth so if we have a
40:39
government on the earth from heaven that
40:41
we have to execute for him that's
40:42
politics so you're not going to escape
40:46
politics don't ignore it make sure you
40:49
vote for justice and righteousness right
40:51
and life and
40:54
God needs this nation free of the devil
41:02
which means it's gonna be good for
41:05
everybody here God is not gonna be a
41:09
parser to who's living here they will
41:11
enjoy all the Freedom and the Liberty to
41:14
prosper you know to live in health to
41:17
have new creations and inventions never
41:19
seen before in this country they'll
41:22
enjoy all the stuff that will be created
41:24
in these 24 years of God in the White
41:26
House you've never heard that that is
41:32
not news to me
41:33
and God has hand-picked the person he
41:38
wants there and there's no human being
41:42
on this earth there's nothing in the
41:45
Earth's over there's nothing that can
41:48
take those people from that white house
41:49
[Applause]
42:00
amen
42:02
hey man I hope everybody's happy about
42:08
that
42:09
that God would pick remember he's
42:13
strange he doesn't think like a man he
42:18
picked the most on likely never in the
42:23
history of our country has one man
42:25
caused such an uproar never in the
42:29
history of our nation or even in this
42:32
world except Christ because Christ
42:35
caused the greatest
42:36
uproar and his time he was not liked by
42:41
the hierarchy he was hated by the ruling
42:44
powers and the devil especially despised
42:47
him and tried every way he could to get
42:51
him out of the picture just have
42:54
something here
42:56
you never hear any of this coming
42:59
against someone who isn't gonna do good
43:01
did you notice that the ones you don't
43:05
care about the country don't even know
43:07
what they're doing that might not have
43:09
been their plan but they just weren't
43:10
the right person amen and that means in
43:14
any country it says when when the
43:18
righteous are in leadership when they're
43:20
in charge the people will they will
43:26
rejoice and God does love everybody but
43:29
just like he chose John the Baptist for
43:32
something Moses or something Abraham for
43:35
something Jacob Isaac it didn't go all
43:38
the way down the line David Solomon he
43:41
hand-picked them before they were here
43:44
he still does that
43:46
and it's usually if you look at King
43:49
David he smelled like the Sheep he
43:53
danced and sang in the meadows you would
43:56
not have picked him to be king
43:59
even the Prophet was amazed the ones who
44:03
look tough strong handsome those were
44:07
the ones he wanted to and God said no no
44:11
no no yeah and what about Gideon he here
44:19
all the time from God he actually told
44:22
God no no no no no I must have the wrong
44:24
person nope I'm not doing this no no
44:27
that is not me I am NOT doing it but God
44:32
kicked him did he do it you have to be
44:38
the same way because you know what I
44:41
wouldn't pick me and apparently neither
44:45
would a lot of pastors
44:52
they don't know what they're missing for
44:57
one reason they don't like the pink here
45:00
this is the absolute truth yeah God
45:04
would not do that that's our answer when
45:07
you know I love you but you don't know
45:08
him you might put color on your hair in
45:13
the middle of the night as you're
45:17
walking across a platform to speak turn
45:19
it green then they run wait for it
45:29
[Applause]
45:30
one change something so insignificant
45:37
because image is important your image
45:42
inside is always more important than
45:44
that outside and the thing is I've known
45:47
a lot of these pastors for 40 years
45:50
helped in all their projects my dad that
45:53
we would my family go help in all their
45:55
projects to help the poor the sick paint
45:57
their churches up to bring them food and
45:59
they were blessed beyond measure about
46:01
how godly and awesome we were until I
46:04
fell off the deep man and put pink in my
46:05
hair you choose they choose a man I will
46:16
tell you this their wives coming to my
46:18
meetings
46:23
and the other thing they say is well I
46:25
love what you do but our congregation is
46:27
not ready and when will I see them at
46:29
the meetings they show up I've got a
46:34
pastor something those church I'm so
46:36
glad and love with Revelation so you
46:43
have to choose through your whole life
46:44
you have to choose things and I am glad
46:47
he chose me and I actually like the pink
46:51
hair now it's not going away because in
46:57
this time we're gonna be strange just
46:59
like him we will be different speak
47:02
different live differently and it will
47:05
cause people to come and ask you why
47:07
amen I need a tissue
47:10
oh yeah if I if I if I cry during the
47:15
worship it's gonna be over any man yeah
47:22
Jesus makes me cry a lot the love he has
47:26
for us and he he looks beyond our
47:31
mistakes and the thing is people wanted
47:36
to throw mistakes in with sin and
47:37
they'll tell you have to repent you may
47:39
have made a mistake but you apologize
47:41
for mistakes you don't repent for
47:43
mistakes you repent for sin I'm having
47:46
to teach that to some people there's a
47:48
difference Amen I mean you know I've had
47:52
people say all kinds of things like well
47:54
you lied because you said you would come
47:56
by and you didn't
47:57
I said that's I forgot that's not lying
48:01
lying is saying something that's not the
48:04
true and so they're gonna get a lesson
48:07
if they say things like that to me and
48:09
what no I love you very much but you
48:12
know when you've got 15 phone calls and
48:14
people showing up you gotta make
48:15
decisions for things around the world
48:16
you probably forget some time I said but
48:20
that's not lying okay so I apologized so
48:25
don't let people make you feel like you
48:27
have sinned because you made a mistake
48:29
amen
48:31
okay making mistakes in this world is
48:34
gonna happen sometime right if I got to
48:37
send a letter to somebody you know the
48:40
simplest things but most people who bash
48:42
you by the way they don't have a vision
48:45
of their own the father showed me this a
48:48
long time a lot of the bastards out
48:49
there that bash you online or whatever
48:51
they don't have their own vision so
48:54
people who do they will bash you this is
48:58
truth that's why they can get so mean
49:01
they have nothing in their own life just
49:03
keeping them focused and their going
49:05
forward something they have nothing to
49:07
do and they don't want to do anything
49:08
they look around to see who they can
49:10
pick on let them go just let it go and
49:14
you keep running your race amen because
49:19
you know the enemy will try anything you
49:20
can to get you sad offended wounded
49:26
fearful that will crush you keep you
49:29
back take you off the track and so if
49:32
you can't get you to abandon Christ or
49:34
just say I'm giving up completely he'll
49:37
do whatever he can to delay you or
49:38
distract you so don't let it happen just
49:41
say well I'm not gonna let that it's not
49:43
touching me I'm not letting it penetrate
49:46
me you notice Christ walks like that in
49:47
this earth
49:48
amen so in this time we will do things
49:52
to manifest them and demonstrate for
49:55
them and it won't necessarily be in a
49:57
small crowd so get ready to go to
50:01
Walmart and you're walking in the air
50:03
while you're pushing your cart down here
50:04
down the aisle you know how if you're
50:07
walking your the carts down here see how
50:12
many people come to you say what is up
50:14
with you I am manifesting the Living God
50:20
that sound exciting he's given us a
50:26
whole new way and new weapons and
50:31
demonstrating and manifesting is one of
50:33
those weapons because you are terrifying
50:35
the enemy every time you do something
50:37
like that he'll is afraid right now and
50:42
they and you know what they're not
50:44
really good at hiding that whatever
50:48
rises up and they're afraid but they
50:49
will bash it bash it lies you know and
50:53
misjudgment and everything fails they'll
50:54
do it on purpose to make people think
50:57
that person is nothing
50:59
they're not worth something they have no
51:00
value whatsoever or they're not living
51:02
the right kind of line and they're not
51:04
going to jack the wicked any men but
51:08
hell hell is going to find out that
51:11
heaven is going to expose a lot of that
51:14
amen so we'll know who carries truth who
51:17
lives the truth so we can trust them
51:21
amen
51:22
is a powerful time time for freedom
51:26
everybody say time for freedom that
51:33
means your lies you'd be different your
51:34
children will be raised differently in
51:36
this time we have the right and the
51:39
freedom to command heavens army to push
51:43
back the darkness and crush their plans
51:45
right to raise the dead that we're
51:48
cremated stop earthquakes and make it go
51:53
back the way it was before it happened
51:54
oh stop the storms and not just the
52:02
Hurricanes and you know that has been so
52:05
powerful to work with people over the
52:06
last several months God started the
52:09
weather warriors I didn't and he put one
52:13
more thing on my plate get down there
52:17
and tell people how to take authority
52:18
over those storms
52:20
in this time in the earth you're not
52:22
supposed to have destructive weather say
52:26
I receive it Jesus didn't tolerate the
52:31
storm and that was not the only one he
52:36
stopped it wasn't the only one he
52:40
stopped you do realize the Bible is sort
52:43
of like a basic outline because the
52:48
Bible says itself if everything in all
52:50
the works that Christ did were written
52:52
down the books would go around the world
52:55
so how much do you not know about
52:59
he didn't just raise the people from the
53:02
dead you read about in that Bible it was
53:05
an example okay well while we raised
53:08
someone from the dead they were dead for
53:10
four days Wow way to spend thirty days
53:14
and you're your family members ashes
53:18
have been sitting on the Shelf in the
53:19
closet the mantle and you go oh well we
53:22
forgot to have their celebration service
53:24
so you're bringing a little ashes and
53:27
set it there you better be ready for
53:29
this one and Jesus says to you and you
53:34
hear him get everything laying hands on
53:36
that John come in the ashes come in
53:39
their life in their spirit to come back
53:41
into that body and it burst open and
53:46
there is a whirlwind of ashes right here
53:49
in wherever they're having the
53:50
acceleration there's gonna be a
53:53
celebration and those ashes go out
53:55
places they stopped and there's the
53:57
person I tell you they'll be miraculous
54:01
miraculous conversions
54:04
and salvations in the celebration when
54:10
they go in Jesus name I command that
54:12
spirit of the whatever tobe white to
54:15
come back into his body and that earned
54:17
burst and that whirlwind of ashes come
54:20
up say he can put the ashes back
54:23
together even if they sprinkled him on
54:27
the ocean he knows where every molecule
54:32
of our body is and he can bring it all
54:38
back together say that is a greater work
54:46
I've seen many of the greater works and
54:50
their greater or he would not have said
54:53
they were greater right so you know it
54:57
be praised against uh they pray against
54:59
the storms and everything and your
55:00
prayers probably made a difference but
55:03
when you command Christ commanded the
55:08
storm to stop he stopped the winds and
55:14
he calmed the waves amen
55:18
so we do greater works so we stop
55:21
earthquakes who make it put it back say
55:26
Amen well you believe it or not it's
55:30
gonna happen this is the thing if he
55:33
ever wants you to do something like that
55:35
you will hear him you're not going to
55:39
sit down and make a list I'm gonna go do
55:40
this on this day those type of things he
55:42
will say it to you and you will hear him
55:45
and he showed me that happening in the
55:47
earth
55:47
I was taken forward and I saw what
55:50
happening I saw a young person in
55:52
California they've been a massive
55:54
earthquake buildings crumbled everywhere
55:56
hundreds of people died in this
55:59
earthquake and they ran out in the
56:01
street and they said stop and then they
56:07
said put it back in Jesus name
56:13
and the earth began to shift and all the
56:17
parts of the buildings came up out of
56:18
the ground and put the building back
56:20
together the bridges came back together
56:23
and all the dead were raised and back in
56:25
the offices or the stores are walking on
56:27
the street where they were before it
56:29
happened
56:32
say greater work we will do them in that
56:39
powerful Jesus said all the works I did
56:44
you will do and even greater works you
56:47
will do we didn't know what the greater
56:50
works were is those things a plane
56:55
crashes everybody dies the news media
56:58
run to record it and show it and the
57:01
person with the microphones are believer
57:03
and Jesus says to them bring them all
57:06
back to a life and they command over
57:09
that whole thing you will go back the
57:12
way you were I command every spirit of
57:14
every person somebody come back into
57:15
their body and life will be restored now
57:17
I know I've told you before all the
57:20
people came back from the dead that were
57:22
burnt but the plane also came back
57:24
together like it never happened and
57:28
because she was the reporter they all
57:32
saw it all over the world because he's
57:37
not doing things in secret they will be
57:41
done openly manifests the way word
57:44
manifest means to clearly and plainly
57:46
make known you're living in those days
57:52
and I'm just giving you a warning a
57:54
heads-up then it will happen to you
57:58
sometime in your life
58:00
it's gonna happen and the mass dead
58:04
raising the raising of the masses of
58:06
dead it's going to happen in our
58:09
lifetime it's going to happen
58:13
that means if somebody went somewhere
58:15
some evil harming and the use chemical
58:18
warfare and the whole entire place was
58:20
dead you will go in there and speak
58:25
God's Word whatever God says for you to
58:27
say you speak and everyone who is dead
58:29
would be alive whole and well and all
58:32
the any remnants of that chemicals on
58:35
the entire city the ground the air the
58:37
water will be gone in Jesus name people
58:42
are gonna know and this is his real
58:46
reason for doing that they will know
58:48
there is a God and we only do this
58:53
because of him we can't do this without
58:57
him but we will do it for him and with
59:01
him and God's plan is to erase the whole
59:06
gray area that says there is no God so I
59:13
know I've seen millions of Muslims
59:16
running to the kingdom I've been shown
59:19
millions of homosexuals run into the
59:22
kingdom and as they ran into the kingdom
59:26
they got all their body parts back like
59:29
God made them God does care about them
59:35
and I can tell you this
59:36
I'm messing around this some of those
59:38
people has some of the greatest callings
59:41
on their life
59:43
or the devil would not have messed him
59:46
up and they think you were born that way
59:48
but God doesn't make anybody that way
59:50
because that is not his image and we are
59:53
made in His image there'll be some of
59:58
the greatest witnesses amen
60:03
Jesus even appearing before the scene he
60:06
not the Sanhedrin you know he just said
60:10
to me I already did that he does have a
60:17
sense of humor and he's like but here
60:19
beside me walking with ya I know he's in
60:21
me but he's also walking with me he'll
60:24
tell me things to say thing to talk
60:25
about because he loves this time amen
60:30
he's been appearing in person to the
60:33
Taliban even to some of the ISIS like
60:39
face to face with them someone I know
60:44
was going around preaching these they
60:47
preach a lot in the Middle East and they
60:49
went into this country where they're the
60:51
the Taliban were actually in this
60:53
country he's fearless this person is
60:54
fearless he's done all kinds of certain
60:56
signs and wonders for God in those
60:58
countries and then he went in that
61:00
country and separately I thought if he
61:04
was going on the sides to be one of us
61:05
all these Muslims came out to him and
61:09
the one in the front had a Bible under
61:11
holding a Bible on their head they were
61:14
walking to him not with guns now in
61:18
machine guns not wanting to blow him up
61:20
which was what most of them I do their
61:22
walk around with a Bible on his head and
61:25
they went up and said the 1-cos speaking
61:27
that's it did you bring Bibles with you
61:29
you have any Bibles because I've been
61:33
reading this one to them and they want
61:35
to know that God they want to know Jesus
61:38
Christ do you have any Bibles you have
61:40
Bibles that we can have because of one
61:46
of them having the Word of God they
61:48
didn't burn it they didn't throw it away
61:49
God moved on them to read it and they
61:53
begin to see a different kind of God
61:56
then who they worshiped and that whole
61:59
group got saved that was that was a
62:02
suddenly the other thing that is for
62:05
this time are suddenly say suddenly say
62:09
something will happen overnight
62:13
and it will change me forever it's
62:17
called a suddenly
62:20
[Music]
62:21
it's called a suddenly because we're in
62:26
an accelerated time even in our own
62:29
country here in America so many things
62:32
have already been shifted and begin to
62:34
change in a short amount of time over
62:39
the years we've fought there's been so
62:40
many jobs lost in this country it wasn't
62:44
just because of one one leader it's just
62:47
happened the economy has really gone
62:49
down and this time it will prosper and
62:51
flourish like it never has before
62:53
because of God's plan of our obedience
62:56
and because Jesus is here taking over ok
63:00
that there will be one suddenly after
63:03
another in our economy and and since we
63:06
now have a righteous man in the Supreme
63:09
Court and I started talking about
63:11
Kavanagh and stopped but we will have
63:13
one suddenly after another in this
63:15
country because this is God's plan and
63:19
we're ready for it amen but but in a
63:24
little bit over just a year or so two
63:28
million jobs have been created in this
63:31
country and in my own City I see signs
63:34
everywhere we are hiring hiring hiring
63:37
hiring we have so much hiring going on
63:40
in our city and when I visit places I
63:42
see those same signs they're hiring
63:45
because they have money and their
63:49
business is increasing that means they
63:51
need more people this is a good time to
63:54
get into business amen and I like to
63:58
tell people what Jesus says to me he
64:00
said I was sawn I was sent into the
64:03
business arena I was first known in the
64:06
business arena a carpenter he said my
64:10
father did not send me as pastor Jesus
64:13
he didn't he sent him as a business man
64:19
who could connect with every area and
64:22
everywhere whatever the arenas were he
64:25
could connect with him because he was a
64:26
businessman
64:28
why was the eating with the sinners
64:31
people wanna know how come he was sit
64:32
with sinners because he had business
64:35
contracts with them
64:38
he was a master carpenter he had the
64:41
best home they knew he did really good
64:44
stuff so he had all kinds of business
64:46
contracts all the time
64:47
Heymann had him with the sinners and
64:49
they liked him business is a good Avenue
64:54
to take the gospel that's why he's
64:58
sending me as a business woman I know I
65:04
have revelation I know talk about the
65:07
wild things of God he gave me that
65:08
revelation he gave it to me
65:12
I never said John said okay I want this
65:14
this and this I only asked him for love
65:17
I wanted to love him I asked him for
65:21
more love I'm gonna be like my earthly
65:24
father was who was filled with so much
65:26
of the love of God
65:27
he literally loved his enemies and had
65:30
fun doing it i understanding i
65:33
understand the blessing that curse it's
65:35
a whole lot more fun to bless people who
65:36
don't like you it gives the devil a
65:40
really bad day and it goes into the soul
65:43
of that person and it makes you happy
65:46
cuz it's better to give dad my dad lived
65:51
by that so I give away stuff all the
65:53
time
65:53
I had them come home from work there'd
65:55
be stuff missing
65:58
he knew I gave it away my dad did that
66:02
we get I give away food people give me
66:04
suffer give it away I get money I give
66:06
it away that's why I have a CFO that
66:08
takes care of the money I won't be able
66:11
to go anywhere I'm gonna make any
66:13
products when I first got products at
66:15
game all away I gave all my books away
66:18
I'm gonna bless you here's okay 500
66:21
books away marbles where's the books I
66:24
bless the people she says those were
66:26
supposed to be sold so we could get more
66:29
and then you can take some of them and
66:30
give them away blessed people so from
66:33
now on those products aren't coming to
66:34
you they're being shipped to me every
66:39
what happen on the products table
66:42
because my dad has such a heart to love
66:45
and care he didn't care what color you
66:48
were he didn't care what he didn't even
66:49
care what your faith was he was gonna
66:50
love you bless you and feed you he was a
66:55
good example for me that's why you got
66:58
to have people that can do the other
66:59
stuff even in business you can have a
67:02
visionary the visionary he's so excited
67:05
and passionate about everything if you
67:07
don't have something there to help you
67:08
with your money you're gonna have none
67:10
unless you have both of those gifts you
67:14
need someone who could be administrator
67:17
if you're thinking about going to
67:18
business make sure you have that other
67:20
half that you don't have you can have a
67:23
vision the parks look amazing but if you
67:25
don't have someone to make sure things
67:27
are done right or kept like all the
67:29
licenses and permits are renewed the
67:31
insurance is being paid you know the
67:33
taxes are being paid you better have
67:35
something that can do that keep track of
67:37
stuff for you okay and keep it multi
67:40
trillionaire didn't give whole
67:42
warehouses away if you want to this is
67:49
also a time for money to be manifested
67:52
in great amounts to us the wealth of the
67:56
wicked
67:58
and then I receive it - I'm gonna
68:02
receive that and people gonna want oh we
68:06
know we're getting out of here why did
68:08
you why'd you tell those people those
68:09
things we want to leave I want that's
68:11
not contain ship time you don't know
68:13
what time he's coming back that's what
68:16
we have some pins back there magnets as
68:18
they roll up your rapture rug that's
68:23
Holy Spirit yells that everywhere he
68:25
goes
68:25
roll up your rapture rug that's not what
68:31
he meant by occupy but that's what I was
68:37
taught my whole life in church Jesus
68:42
could come next week you might come
68:44
tomorrow oh and I don't think you know
68:47
that I think we should be encouraged to
68:50
be here stay here do something make a
68:55
difference and don't buy the c-rations
68:59
it tastes awful I don't even think the
69:03
raccoons would eat them people would
69:07
send us stuff in the mail when I don't
69:08
think I want this we throw it on the
69:11
back patio we have a raccoon you know
69:14
assembly that comes every now and then
69:15
they picked it up and threw it back down
69:18
and what we are not eating those okay if
69:22
the raccoons with Needleman a garbage
69:26
they are a bitter one I don't want it
69:29
amen
69:31
they like doughnuts
69:37
those raccoons were getting like that
69:39
fat we finally finally have stopped
69:43
feeding Emily because when we leave
69:46
there
69:46
no one's gonna feed them okay they're
69:48
not it doesn't say that the Lord will
69:50
set a table for them you could set a
69:53
table for us so yeah people come to my
70:01
house and the raccoons are staring this
70:03
like last door and they'll go down knock
70:07
on the doors if you throw something out
70:15
there like a sub sandwich they'll scrape
70:17
all the lettuce and tomatoes out not
70:21
eating that stuff peep out that you're
70:27
hurting the know we've never had a
70:29
single one die that have been
70:33
flourishing bountifully prospering in
70:36
every way the only issue is we've got
70:41
something to keep him away from coming
70:43
over the preserve work next to preserve
70:44
and the cats we feed out front
70:47
guess he's meeting the cats yeah they
70:51
know they're smart they came around the
70:53
front to get the cats food we have to
70:57
got them running away away of course
70:59
they know us so they're like wow you've
71:03
just moved dinner to the front you go
71:06
everything moves Pico there make sure
71:08
the raccoons yeah but there go go away
71:10
go away they like us
71:17
that's why I my I actually just redid my
71:21
whole bio to send out to the pastures
71:24
now who invite me and I've added to a
71:28
tormentor of demons apply for a job
71:34
somewhere to put it on there and see
71:36
what people say to you it is a great
71:41
thing I've had 25 years business
71:46
experience you know and all these people
71:48
and companies I've worked for and
71:49
everything and then I say you know and
71:51
you go on down the little list there you
71:53
know I've done this done that achieve
71:55
that wow that whatever and then I go I'm
71:58
a tormentor of demons I speak to the
72:03
weather you know and the storm stops and
72:07
I live with my husband so many years of
72:09
success with the resident raccoons is a
72:12
crazy squirrel and some rescue cats
72:16
that's either going to impress them with
72:18
nothing to do you I don't I don't have
72:21
to give up resumes now but that would
72:23
have been really nice to give that out
72:25
right be different this is the time for
72:33
great extreme extravagant favor for the
72:37
body of Christ like we have never had it
72:40
before and God told me in America there
72:45
will be a time when people will be proud
72:47
that they have you know Christians for
72:50
their friends the singers will be proud
72:52
to announce oh why not have a couple
72:54
Christians that are my friends they go
72:57
you have Christians what do they talk
72:59
about do they raise the dead you seen
73:02
them raise the dad do they have fire
73:06
coming out of their head
73:08
because we saw some of that on the
73:10
internet we want to know do you know any
73:13
other Christians that might want friends
73:15
cuz they're not doing that right now but
73:21
they will it's a time for freedom and
73:25
I'm also fill this in for free but there
73:29
will come a time that even the wild
73:32
animals will be at peace with us in this
73:35
earth they won't attack they will have
73:39
no fear of us because we'll have so much
73:41
of God's presence and our life they will
73:45
trust us and I'm talking about four
73:48
generations that will happen and then
73:52
when the last last days come there's a
73:54
scripture in the Bible that kind of
73:56
talks about that but it talks about the
73:59
beasts of the field will come and attack
74:00
the people and the people will be
74:02
shocked because it hasn't happened for
74:06
generations because of heaven being in
74:09
this earth and we allow it to be in our
74:11
lives we operate and and you know in the
74:14
supernatural with Jesus Christ he lives
74:17
in you he's gonna operate through you
74:20
then things are going to be drastically
74:23
different in this earth if you apply for
74:27
a job in the government you'll probably
74:28
be hired immediately because you have
74:31
Christian on your application this
74:35
government will be so radically changed
74:39
and justice will be given like it's
74:42
supposed to be given and now I'm gonna
74:46
go back to Cavanaugh for a few minutes
74:48
when I was watching that where they
74:51
actually gave the vote remember he won
74:54
by two votes that was probably by two
74:57
Democrats that changed their mind some
75:00
some of them did actually vote for him
75:02
when they were confronted I think it was
75:06
that one senator the stood up and said
75:07
that he was ashamed of all of them he
75:10
said they're lying and you know you are
75:12
lying but trying to prove Cavanaugh to
75:16
be a victor victor to be a perpetrator
75:21
he said when you say that he is wrong
75:23
he's committed a crime you're lying and
75:26
you know that person was paid and she
75:30
was paid Cavanaugh has been innocent his
75:34
whole life a strong believer a loving
75:38
family man even in high school in
75:40
college so many people who knew him came
75:42
up they didn't put him on the way to see
75:44
him but they told the news reporters in
75:46
anyway you never probably saw that in
75:48
the news they had so many more people
75:51
standing with him than against him but
75:54
they were desperate because nothing else
75:57
was working so they chose lying and
76:00
deceiving which is wrong and I'm talking
76:05
about this is about our justice system
76:07
this is about telling the truth this
76:10
whole thing was about telling the truth
76:11
is that right it wasn't just a position
76:15
it was about the Supreme Court or
76:19
they're supposed to you know make sure
76:22
truth is being done and justice is being
76:25
given while they weren't given him
76:26
justice and the father was telling me in
76:29
heaven he will win that seat and I will
76:32
make sure he wins that seat I don't care
76:35
what they try what they say he is
76:37
absolutely innocent and he himself will
76:39
have justice in that moment and he said
76:42
and when he wins the seat he is one to
76:46
see for heaven on the Supreme Court
76:51
because he's a believer and he said yes
76:54
to God we said yes to God you give him
76:57
permission to operate in you in your
76:59
household in your business and so when I
77:02
was watching all this going on God said
77:04
when they said you know he had one God
77:06
said this moment I am sending three
77:09
special ops angels to be with him the
77:14
whole time he's on the earth the whole
77:16
time he's in the Supreme Court which
77:18
will be a long long time
77:20
he said these angels will keep him from
77:22
all harm and no one who comes against
77:25
him will succeed and he said these
77:27
angels are some of them wants the hosts
77:30
the army who fought for Israel in the
77:33
flesh that's why they're special ops
77:39
special operatives
77:41
that's how importance is to God he said
77:45
when he won he won me a seat God said he
77:50
won me a seat in Supreme Court
77:52
[Applause]
77:58
he is serious about justice and at the
78:04
moment that they said that he had one
78:06
you know it was fifty two forty eight
78:08
and it's them they said he had one I
78:11
heard millions of little babies in
78:15
heaven celebrating and I heard them
78:22
shouting now in America freedom will
78:26
come to all the little babies and what
78:29
was allowed for us to die will be struck
78:33
down and the future is gonna be great
78:39
for the little babies being born in
78:41
America amen if you think heaven wasn't
78:45
involved in that they were very involved
78:47
even the ones living there were involved
78:50
but especially the little babies and
78:53
ones that were aborted that live in
78:55
heaven they were shouting and
78:56
celebrating they knew what was going on
78:58
in the earth they knew how important
79:00
that he won that seat because they will
79:02
overturn Roe vs. Wade
79:03
[Applause]
79:16
thank you Jesus
79:27
amen
79:31
heaven is very excited about this time
79:34
if you have family members living there
79:37
they are all cheering right now because
79:41
heaven is shifting our government so
79:45
they can then shape the future of this
79:48
nation and people will come to this
79:53
country to find God amen so this is
80:00
definitely a time for freedom and
80:05
everyone will benefit from it even the
80:09
ones who didn't want it and you can get
80:11
so far into deception you don't
80:13
realizing you don't realize because of
80:16
the heat of the moment and being used by
80:19
the enemy you cannot even you can't even
80:23
I'm trying to think
80:24
I don't not very good with with human
80:27
words yeah you can't comprehend what
80:29
you're saying yes to how that would
80:31
affect your future and they're not
80:33
realizing that they were damaging the
80:35
future of their generations coming on
80:37
the earth and then I will just talk
80:39
about the agenda because I will and God
80:42
wants me to the agenda of this
80:45
Democratic Party now not even before but
80:49
now has has really regressed into
80:53
darkness so much because they filled
80:57
their self with hate and judgment and
81:00
lies that were given and even the fake
81:03
news are getting physical I mean mental
81:05
therapy mental help because they've
81:08
messed up their own soul as you think it
81:11
in your soul or your heart that is what
81:14
you will become so what they spew down
81:17
all the time that's why they can't let
81:20
it go they have become the very thing
81:24
that they gave out to everybody they ate
81:27
it themselves every time they said it
81:29
and winning their soul and they don't
81:32
know how to be healed they don't know
81:34
how to be made whole
81:35
families were separated I know people
81:38
there family members will not talk to
81:41
them if they voted for Trump they've
81:43
written him off their list like they
81:44
never existed because their souls were
81:49
filled with darkness
81:50
I know Trump wasn't perfect God knows he
81:54
wasn't perfect but if we dug far enough
81:57
back and almost everybody's past we
82:00
should took every every part of the
82:01
media let's go back in their past 30
82:03
years and see what they were doing how
82:07
about all those senators how about all
82:09
those Democrats that were voting against
82:10
Cavanaugh why don't we go back in their
82:13
life and see what they did way back when
82:16
but when we give our lives to God and
82:25
whether you know it or not
82:27
Trump has given his heart to Jesus
82:30
Christ he's given his heart to Jesus
82:34
Christ I know a lot of leaders who he
82:35
calls in all the time Deacon consol he
82:37
stands in the counsel of the godly which
82:41
is another reason why the Liberals don't
82:44
like him because they don't want
82:47
godliness they don't want righteousness
82:49
they thought it was bad enough that
82:51
Trump won and they didn't like him but
82:54
they realized he was giving God a place
82:56
in the White House and welcoming God in
82:59
our country they really got terrified
83:01
thinking it's all over if he stays in
83:04
there we'll lose everything we've gained
83:06
over the last twenty thirty years we'll
83:08
lose it all
83:10
we need to do something to stop this but
83:15
they can't they can't and every time
83:19
they try to do something they desist on
83:22
heaven they will lose they'll lose in
83:28
the elections they'll lose in areas of
83:31
business they lose in areas of the
83:33
government because this is God's divine
83:36
time and when you said right before the
83:38
election I'm turning that map red
83:41
whether anyone likes it or not I'm
83:44
putting my hand on America I'm gonna
83:47
move across it when they wake up in the
83:49
morning they will find out that map is
83:51
red was it red well get ready for the
83:56
midterm elections
83:58
[Applause]
84:09
it's gonna turn it red again because
84:15
this is his plan and it goes from the
84:17
top down and our president is saying yes
84:21
to freedom yes to liberty yester
84:25
prospering yester protecting our country
84:27
yes to a sound military yes to the
84:30
rights of the believers being restored
84:32
right over to in the Johnson amendment
84:34
they said they couldn't speak from their
84:36
pulpit about about the but you know
84:40
about voting his stuff they couldn't
84:41
have a political platform at all which
84:44
wasn't fair because every other group
84:48
could do it it didn't matter what they
84:51
were they could be Satanists and they
84:54
still let them have a political platform
84:56
it didn't matter what kind of platform
84:58
that but then but not Christians because
85:01
we are a threat to the darkness amen so
85:08
God is moving powerfully on our country
85:13
so when Cavanaugh won that was a great
85:17
victory for justice for generations so
85:25
you should be really excited and
85:27

85:29
God chose this time and he said I'm
85:32
starting with America because I know
85:35
who's going to win I know what their
85:37
whole plan is I know the body of Christ
85:39
had been praying and praying for years
85:44
that he would come and heal our land and
85:48
all those prayers were collected in
85:51
bowls and they were chipped amen they
85:56
were chipped so everyone who prayed that
86:01
prayer Chronicles for generations in the
86:04
past are a part of our victory today
86:07
amen because he is healing our land
86:12
and things are going to get better not
86:17
worse amen
86:19
so vote Republican I November to make
86:25

86:42

86:58
won't be doing he knows it all he's been
87:01
from the end at the beginning the
87:02
beginning to the end and he knows all of
87:05
it and he knows who he chooses is going
87:09
to be what he wants him to be amen so I
87:13
don't even know what time it is what
87:14
time is it okay see I don't that's too
87:18
small so that's what he wanted to talk
87:24
about tonight
87:24
he had me wear my patriotic
87:30
and before when you allow the burning of
87:36
our flag that flag will fly high
87:39
everywhere and that image is being put
87:42
on every kind of product possible you'll
87:46
see a lot more red white and blue I saw
87:48
hope businesses painting their
87:49
businesses red white and blue I did
87:53
everywhere I went and you know I've been
87:55
placed aboard the red white and blue
87:56
buildings clothing with it on it even
87:59
some cars were painted red white and
88:01
blue and I promise you you watch and see
88:03
how many me how many automobile I didn't
88:07
know what to call them
88:08
the manufacturers Saint you Holy Spirit
88:10
begin to send those cars and trucks out
88:13
painted red white and blue it's going to
88:18
happen more and more and more and our
88:20
flag will be honored because it
88:22
represents Christ event it represents
88:27
Christ and America belongs to God
88:30
America is a Christian nation
88:33
[Applause]
88:40
so I'm always happy to talk about
88:43
America that is beautiful because God is
88:47
here amen and along with that and the
88:51
body of Christ beginning to manifest in
88:55
amazing stunning shocking miraculous
89:00
things that that is one of the reasons
89:03
why God waited for the internet to do
89:05
this because no one can stop those signs
89:10
and wonders being seen all over the
89:14
world
89:14
amen I think a lot of people in this
89:19
country are very tired of doom and gloom
89:21
predictions this is not the time for God
89:25
to use whether as judgment it's not this
89:30
is the day of his power not the day of
89:32
his wrath those things are recorded in
89:35
the very end of the Bible
89:37
don't jump ahead okay make sure we all
89:40
walk out our lives and God's timeline
89:43
this is the time for us to stop those
89:46
things and it'd be strange that
89:49
something is allowed to bring
89:50
destruction through the weather because
89:53
we won't tolerate it so how many people
89:56
here have already be become weather
89:58
warriors can I see our hands in here
90:01
yeah where's the weather warrior you're
90:04
taking authority over the storm every
90:09
time and let me tell you the the
90:11
meteorologists don't know what's wrong
90:13
with their minds just like the fake news
90:16
don't know what's going on the
90:18
meteorologists don't know what's going
90:19
on actually we actually typed out one of
90:23
the reports after lane that was the
90:25
hurricane that was opposed to hit Hawaii
90:27
I think was a category 4 and it wasn't
90:30
very far if this is going to hit hit the
90:32
coast it's gonna do wipe out buildings
90:35
and many people will be killed and the
90:38
storm surge will go over the whole I
90:39
mean they were making the most
90:40
destructive you ever noticed how they're
90:44
getting more destructive with her with
90:46
her forecast
90:47
like I understand if a storm comes but
90:50
it's not wiping everybody out in the
90:51
state okay it's not they're getting and
90:54
the thing is this if it doesn't happen
90:56
they have to fake it I don't know if any
90:59
of you've seen that I have friends in
91:02
Florida when one storm came through and
91:05
it went down the middle and did almost
91:07
no destruction it actually just did
91:08
bypass Tampa completely and they were
91:11
saying Tampa is gonna be head-on it's
91:12
gonna wipe everybody out there was
91:14
nothing and I think Roy fields if you
91:17
know him Roy feels powerful recording
91:20
artists he's been he was in the Lakeland
91:24
revival he sings a lot for a lot of
91:27
known his way he put it was remember the
91:30
what he put it who's who in the
91:32
Christian leaders ooh he said I have
91:36
sung for them I have sung for them and
91:39
he said but I've never heard this
91:41
revelation before in my life I had had a
91:44
chance to meet him and talk to him for
91:45
about an hour and then his life was
91:47
totally different he said we all need
91:50
this revelation to know who we are he
91:52
said I didn't even know who I was I
91:54
didn't know I didn't know I lived in God
91:56
before I was here I didn't know what
91:58
actually was his offspring and so his
92:02
whole life he had his head out of there
92:03
encounter since then he came as the
92:05
worship leader of the last cruise I was
92:07
on and and he had an amazing time so
92:12
revelation changes you but he himself
92:14
had reported it on Facebook that they
92:18
were trying to fake the storm doing
92:20
destruction in his own City which was
92:21
Kissimmee Florida and there wasn't any
92:24
and they had like wind machines out
92:26
there they have water like rising up
92:28
around this and he said I'm standing out
92:30
my street like there's not a drop of
92:33
rain on me so he actually turned him in
92:37
Peter Nevins said no there's none of
92:40
that's going on and then we did have a
92:43
report when it hit you know in Panama
92:45
City I think I said and I'm trying to
92:48
think I said neither said the airport or
92:50
something was flooded with all the rain
92:52
and that bill when they showed that was
92:54
not even from there you have to
92:57
understand they have got years of
92:59
destruction
93:00
of storms years of them and so they've
93:04
been using some of them I'm not saying
93:06
it wasn't actually saying there wasn't
93:07
nothing that happened but even in
93:09
Florence I do know there was there was
93:11
flooding and stuff like that but you
93:13
need to realize that if that category
93:15
that storm and hit head-on they would
93:17
have blown the buildings off the beach
93:19
there would be no buildings there'd be
93:22
nobody because it's like it was like a
93:24
bowl and when that went think a mature
93:27
it was a tropical storm it started as a
93:29
four till we started taking authority
93:31
over and you saw every single day the
93:34
news media would say it would get
93:35
stronger but it got downgraded and it
93:38
even showed this thing zigzag because
93:40
every time we would hit it it was exact
93:42
and they went this is the weirdest storm
93:45
in the history of meteorology we've
93:47
never we could never predict it because
93:50
we were telling it what it couldn't do
93:52
the believers the sinners can't do that
93:56
you don't have authority over the storms
93:58
but the cuts again on Facebook you're
94:01
gonna start a whole new move of God move
94:04
of God means it's not gonna stop I've
94:06
called the weather warriors and I will
94:09
start in that way with the Bight of
94:11
Christ who doesn't care whose
94:13
denomination they belong to because
94:16
those things affect everybody everywhere
94:19
they're gonna lay down all I've no one
94:21
ever said it was assembly god I'm
94:22
Baptists I'm not I mean nobody ever said
94:25
that to me on all the comments they
94:27
never said that I'm so glad that we're
94:29
taking authority over the storm of the
94:30
body of Christ that's coming together
94:32
we're doing this together and we are
94:33
defeating them it was powerful amen
94:40
so why don't we stand up and do
94:42
something if you've never done it before
94:44
we're going to take authority over the
94:45
storms that are out there right now and
94:49
the reason why they've been doing such
94:51
horrible destruction is because we have
94:53
let it happen Satan has run rampant
94:57
earth ruling and reigning and the only
95:00
ones who really could stop him was the
95:03
body of Christ filled with Jesus Christ
95:06
because we've been given power over all
95:08
the power of the enemy
95:11
Christ stop the storm amen and he said
95:16
the things I did you will do is that
95:18
true well we haven't been doing all the
95:20
things but we are now so we're going to
95:24
do this together say I choose as a child
95:27
of God
95:28
through the blood of Jesus Christ I take
95:33
power over all the power of the enemy
95:37
operating through any storm out there
95:40
whether it's a tropical storm a
95:43
hurricane no matter what it is we take
95:50
power over that we come in the middle of
95:54
ours to rise in that storm so the high
96:00
pressure will crush us storm it will be
96:05
downgraded until it becomes nothing we
96:10
command the hosts of heaven to go in the
96:13
storms begin to shred the bands all the
96:17
way around the storm
96:19
[Applause]
96:23
we receive justice through the weather
96:28
through Jesus Christ so be it
96:32
amen amen amen
96:43
sit down so we did it through the but
96:50
Jesus gave us power worth while the
96:52
enemy God did not on purpose create
96:55
destructive weather to kill steal and
96:56
destroy
96:57
guess who kills steals and destroys yeah
97:00
the devil does and now he's losing that
97:04
remember the keys in hell
97:07
that Christ took away from him death
97:11
hell and the grave were those storms
97:15
bring death and we were also given the
97:19
keys to the kingdom is that right so
97:22
Jesus has given us keys he's given his
97:24
power and authority he's given us
97:26
declarations he's given as an example
97:29
how he lived his life we are joint heirs
97:31
with him I was in law for eight years I
97:35
totally understand what being a joint
97:37
heir is you have the rights whatever he
97:41
had we have whatever you did we can do
97:44
that's what that means you're a joint
97:47
heir the last Testament is the last will
97:52
and testament of Jesus Christ just like
97:55
in law he gave us us rights in that well
97:59
amen and when he died and was risen
98:03
again he even gave us power over death
98:06
so you don't have to die from sickness
98:08
and disease
98:11
even as your soul prospers you will
98:14
prosper and be in health it is so
98:20
powerful to understand what the word
98:23
means and how to apply it to your life
98:27
that is getting training every
98:30
missionary should know about commanding
98:33
the host of heaven and sending them
98:35
against all the darkness in the
98:37
countries that their Minister being
98:39
missionaries in anyone who works against
98:43
human trafficking should know about
98:45
using the host that is heavens army that
98:49
was not created to defend heaven then
98:53
didn't get to fight when Lucifer fell
98:55
not one angel fought against any of
98:58
those one-third of the angels God kicked
99:01
him out on a lightning bolt
99:03
he made heaven it is his home he is in
99:07
charge of heaven so why did he make the
99:09
hosts why did he make them there's a
99:16
scroll in heaven that has been opened
99:18
recently that talks about the destiny of
99:21
the hosts that they cannot complete
99:23
their own destiny without us they cannot
99:28
on their own decide to go attack hell it
99:32
would have been wiped out already they
99:34
can't just get together and say ok let's
99:36
see today we're gonna go to this country
99:38
and wipe out all this we're gonna then
99:40
we're going to go this one we're gonna
99:41
do all this they have to have orders now
99:46
I know they have positions they have
99:48
inspectors they have people who command
99:50
certain parts of the army they have
99:52
positions like inspector to transport
99:55
they have a scout to go behind the enemy
99:57
lines and film all the activities of
99:59
hell it goes back to headquarters heaven
100:03
they have all of these positions that's
100:07
why we have those positions in our army
100:10
even in our own army those troops on her
100:13
own the privates can get together and
100:15
try to drive weapons off somewhere and
100:17
attack something they can't do that they
100:20
have to have orders as the military to
100:23
operate
100:24
and so does Heaven's military but we
100:28
were created to be commanders there's
100:32
many scriptures in the Bible that talked
100:33
about commanding even God said command
100:37
ye me didn't he he was not saying tell
100:41
me what to do he was saying you command
100:45
what will be done if you already know
100:50
God you know what his desire is for
100:52
something you already know it you're
100:55
living righteous correct then you can
100:58
call the army to come and fight on your
101:00
behalf and not just fight on your head
101:02
behalf but command it or God wouldn't
101:06
say command Jesus was also the Lord of
101:11
Hosts he was over the army what he did
101:14
we can do I'm not here to tell you all
101:16
the Scriptures I'm just telling you you
101:18
need to command the army of heaven but
101:22
the first thing you have to do is you
101:24
have to realize that you were given
101:25
power say the hosts of heaven we're not
101:30
given power over all the power of the
101:33
enemy say the angels are under us not
101:39
over us do you understand that
101:43
we came from inside God himself
101:47
we are his offspring he spoke and the
101:49
angels were made they were sent to
101:52
protect us and keep us in all of our
101:54
ways
101:56
now some people knew that and they
101:58
operated in that that's happened with
102:00
people before but in this time he wants
102:02
the body of Christ to realize stop
102:07
fighting his plans the enemy wants you
102:11
to fight God's plans because then you
102:14
won't become what he wants you to become
102:16
which is dangerous just a matter what
102:22
your age is your position is how much
102:24
money you have
102:26
it doesn't matter if you receive Jesus
102:28
Christ as your Savior then wash clean of
102:31
all your sins you're kind of righteous
102:33
you have entrance into heaven into all
102:35
of eternity why wouldn't you be able to
102:38
man say we're kings and priests unto our
102:45
God those are spiritual levels of
102:50
authority say every King commands an
102:58
army in the earth as the body of Christ
103:04
we are in the kingdom a spiritual
103:08
Kingdom we have spiritual weapons we get
103:12
to use them to pull down strongholds of
103:16
darkness
103:18
so wherever darkness is and evil is
103:22
operating we can do something about it
103:27
amen in this time off living yeah
103:34
the Holy Spirit would always yell at me
103:37
don't try it you do it don't just try it
103:44
if we're supposed to live in a way that
103:48
nothing by any means will harm us and
103:54
people can quote that scripture all day
103:55
long and yet harm comes to you doesn't
103:58
it we're attacked by the enemy aren't we
104:01
yeah well the army was designed and
104:04
created to stop those attacks to keep
104:09
you in all your ways amen because when
104:13
we are free of fear of being attacked we
104:17
can push back the enemy because he
104:21
certainly is not expecting it so he
104:24
doesn't like this meeting he doesn't
104:27
like these words he doesn't like me at
104:29
all that's okay I don't like him either
104:33
he's on the bottom of my list actually
104:35
he's under my feet
104:41
he is our doormat the Bible even says so
104:46
so we're not under but we are over
104:52
because we rule and reign with Christ
104:55
and the Bible says in this life not talk
105:00
them up you know later on we will - not
105:02
that they will not in the in the next
105:04
life not your life but in the next time
105:06
when there is no time when time is no
105:09
more that's the end not the end of
105:12
everything is the end of time when time
105:15
when you don't have to have calendars
105:17
and your body's not going to age and you
105:19
have to be concerned about am I gonna
105:21
have this to do that when that time of
105:24
timeless comes when we're timeless I'm
105:28
asking for that right now
105:30
but you asked what you believe in your
105:32
house do not doubt you should have
105:34
whatsoever you say I'm saying I'm
105:36
timeless he is reversing back to my
105:42
youth the people in heaven are timeless
105:46
no one is old if your grandmother or
105:50
great-grandmother moved to heaven at 99
105:52
she is not coming back when they step
106:00
out of this body they're 99 this step of
106:03
the wrinkled right wrinkled hard of
106:06
hearing their sight I say it's going
106:08
they probably don't feel very good they
106:10
can't run a job and they step out of
106:13
that body no because of 25 do you think
106:14
they're going back they aren't they'll
106:20
pray for you and declare over you and
106:23
make plans for you in heaven but they
106:24
are not coming back they won't be happy
106:30
and the day when we are timeless there
106:35
will be no war no evil no sickness no
106:39
disease no lack no threats no rejection
106:44
of any kind and we will live like that
106:50
through eternity but we can still create
106:53
we can invent we can speak to things and
106:57
they will appear you can ride on light
107:00
you can ride on music be transported to
107:04
light do time you have planets to visit
107:09
for vacation the new heaven will be your
107:15
home but you're going vacation to other
107:18
planets he says there will be a new
107:20
earth new heaven say it
107:24
and a new earth the earth will not just
107:28
be God's home in my father's house this
107:33
is Jesus speaking in his house that's
107:35
the world in this world this home that's
107:38
called heaven are many mansions that's
107:42
what's going on now but at the end of
107:44
time when he makes a new earth bigger
107:48
than our galaxy a massive earth that has
107:51
one landmass in an ocean I know there'll
107:54
be no more seas the sea separate the
107:56
land masses but as long as God exists
108:00
the river of life will never stop
108:01
flowing from him that's how the crystal
108:04
sea is made in heaven on the bottom is
108:07
not saying just gemstones they flow out
108:10
of the Father they're a part of him so
108:13
if you should one day wake up and you
108:16
have emeralds in your skin as a bracelet
108:21
that's the father's image not even New
108:28
Age can do that the devil tries to steal
108:37
as much as he can he lived there
108:40
remember
108:41
he knew how things worked in a lot of
108:43
things he says or his we're never is
108:48
your life and eternity will be the most
108:51
most splendors wondrous thing you've
108:55
ever experienced people move to have a
108:57
noun for R&R because they won't be there
109:03
one day they'll be moving to the
109:06
father's house right now they have a
109:08
place in the father's house is that what
109:10
the word says right now they go to
109:12
prepare a place for you and the world
109:14
called heaven which is the father's
109:16
house but on the new earth it will be
109:20
our house and he's going to pack his
109:24
bags and climb on the New Jerusalem and
109:27
we'll come down to the new earth and
109:29
he'll be with us forever so even he is
109:34
willing to move with this whole plan for
109:36
eternity
109:38
and we will be timeless we will have
109:42
glorified bodies we will be immortal all
109:47
of this is in the word mortality will
109:52
take on immortality when he said know ye
109:56
not that your gods that's the little G
109:58
that's what he was talking about one day
110:01
we'll be immortal like them we'll never
110:02
die never sin will never lack we'll be
110:07
timeless there'll be no time in heaven
110:10
there's no time in the new earth and
110:12
he'll create all these new things for us
110:14
to go and put things on it for us to
110:16
enjoy and have fun every planet will be
110:18
different and you won't need a spacesuit
110:20
or a spaceship to go there you'll be
110:23
timeless this is a beautiful future
110:28
isn't it so this little bit of time that
110:32
we are on this earth but we will get to
110:36
do supernatural the Bible says will be a
110:40
type and group of people a generation a
110:42
type and group of people those are those
110:46
manifested sons and daughters of God it
110:49
wasn't about Israel becoming a nation I
110:51
know a lot of people think that
110:52
generation was the generation they would
110:56
still be here when Jesus came but a lot
110:57
of them I've already died moved to
110:58
heaven haven't they that was in 1948 is
111:03
that correct
111:03
Rick got that one
111:10
in 1948 a miracle happened in Israel do
111:15
what I'll fix my fix it is it falling
111:19
off thank you for telling me honey I
111:23
just I pinned my scars down these little
111:25
scarves they'd be all the way on the
111:27
floor I'd walk around with one little
111:29
piece up here and it's on the floor I'm
111:30
draggin and nobody ever told me nobody
111:33
ever said oh my your scarf is swimming
111:34
off of you so my team have little signs
111:39
you see they give but you know he just
111:43
kinda lets it go sometimes so we have
111:48
been chosen by God to be here or you
111:51
wouldn't be alive and sitting there
111:53
people go maybe I wasn't chosen are you
111:55
alive are you breathing were you born in
111:58
this time you were chosen you were
112:03
chosen and you're representing all those
112:05
who went before you and you don't know
112:07
who lived a thousand years ago maybe you
112:09
do maybe you don't know but somewhere in
112:12
your generational line was someone who
112:14
laid down their life for the gospel and
112:16
what he is doing is putting on the earth
112:20
right now those who generational line
112:23
somewhere lay down their life for the
112:26
gospel so don't say you didn't have
112:29
anybody you had somebody or you wouldn't
112:32
be sitting here we get to help complete
112:35
their destiny because he gives a destiny
112:39
or a purpose for a generational line and
112:42
even though they didn't get to complete
112:45
it they started it they share and the
112:50
same reward we got that's why they're so
112:54
excited that you're here right now you
112:57
are remember the body of Christ you are
112:59
going to reap reward for you and them
113:02
and they watch you do it they won't miss
113:06
one time that you win someone to the
113:09
Lord they won't miss one time that you
113:11
manifest for God in this earth they will
113:13
see all of it because we have a cloud of
113:16
witnesses
113:18
is that right according to Hebrews 12:1
113:21
we have a great cloud of witnesses
113:24
watching our race
113:25
that means they get to see it and
113:28
they're excited and they're all cheering
113:29
heaven is cheering they laugh every time
113:33
Satan fails and he can hear them all the
113:37
way down into hell and heaven roared the
113:42
other day they're gonna roar on November
113:48
6 so I've really enjoyed this time with
114:00
y'all I hope you were blessed by heaven
114:02
amen amen
114:09
and so just we never I told you all
114:11
these things that I will be working God
114:14
walked in the wall through the wall of
114:16
my hotel room a couple months ago and he
114:20
wrote on the wall literally what I'd be
114:23
doing for the next 50 years that's not
114:25
the end of my assignment but he wrote
114:28
for 50 years the platforms I would speak
114:30
from the very first one he was switching
114:33
now don't be concerned I've been
114:35
spending years many years revealing
114:38
heaven but I'm in my next phase which is
114:41
creating heaven to put in the
114:44
marketplace a lot of people heard me
114:45
talk about this a while we literally are
114:47
this year starting to put things in the
114:51
marketplace that look like heaven sound
114:52
like heaven you'll be eating off of it
114:55
wearing it walking on it listening to it
114:58
you'll have walls that move and say
115:00
things that's in heaven and so we're
115:05
doing that now so he changed and
115:07
switched my priority number one is the
115:10
business world the marketplace the
115:13
business world being CEO and putting
115:15
stuff in the marketplace it represents
115:17
heaven that this people really people in
115:19
this world need that because right now
115:21
Satan has put his mark on everything you
115:24
wear it you have to stand you look at it
115:26
it's in design it's an interior design
115:28
architectural design it's in clothing
115:30
it's an accessories it's in-home stuff
115:32
isn't everything it's in all the schools
115:35
it's everywhere so God is now putting
115:38
heaven there amen
115:40
and you can have things that represent
115:42
in heaven and so I have to do that or we
115:46
won't be there I'm not saying other
115:47
people won't do it but we will majorly
115:49
be impacting this world amen and number
115:53
two will still be revealing heaven and
115:55
training the body of Christ but number
115:57
three will be the arts and entertainment
116:00
world which means Hollywood
116:03
so I will be seeing many times with
116:07
celebrities in Hollywood directors
116:09
producers and don't do it a lot about
116:12
the Christians do oh my gosh that
116:13
person's over there talking to Holly bit
116:15
they're gonna go down the hole
116:16
no Hollywood's changing how it was
116:21
changing what they're gonna produce what
116:22
they're gonna put out there what they're
116:23
gonna market and even places of
116:26
entertainment never had before and earth
116:27
will be created for you to go and have
116:28
good family fun Amen new hotel designs
116:33
it's in it's totally invaded with heaven
116:36
that the stuff in the rooms the stuff in
116:38
the walls the stuff displayed there the
116:40
things you can do while you're there
116:42
it's all changing whole amusement parks
116:46
will be lined up with what heaven is
116:48
doing in the earth right now video games
116:51
will be shown that young people can be
116:53
part of working with heavens army
116:56
destroying the darkness pushing back you
116:57
know the evil and these video games
117:00
instead of being invaded by hell they'll
117:02
be invaded by heaven all kinds of things
117:06
whatever young people like we're making
117:08
it with heaven in it and so we all will
117:12
have movies in the movie theaters that
117:15
show a lot about heaven of time of the
117:18
spirit round the spirit realm the spirit
117:20
world they want the spirit realm they
117:23
want that unseen realm they're so hungry
117:24
for the unseen realm it's not a fake
117:27
it's not a fantasy you know they'll stop
117:31
running after maybe so superheroes for a
117:34
while but definitely aliens will be put
117:36
on the back burner although some of the
117:39
hosts look like them
117:42
so I just want to thank you for come
117:45
tomorrow I have another powerful message
117:47
to give to encourage and inspire you
117:49
it's gonna be amazing
117:51
you're gonna get some protocol from
117:53
heaven on how to work with the army of
117:56
heaven and things about your life to be
117:59
accountable so that you can work with
118:01
them because tell you heaven I know they
118:04
hear the prayers of sinners people think
118:05
they don't but they do
118:06
he hears the prayers of sinners he
118:09
couldn't he couldn't answer them amen
118:11
heaven here's everybody's words but the
118:15
army is not going to listen to someone
118:19
trying to command them when they're
118:19
sinning when they're sweating people
118:22
you're not going to do it they will stay
118:25
in there and stare at you so if you want
118:28
to be a part of using them as one of
118:30
your spiritual weapons and sending them
118:32
all over this world the potent
118:33
strongholds of darkness expose the
118:35
wicked people themselves take them down
118:38
not kill them
118:40
unless they have to I will let you know
118:43
this that I do know like for Cavanaugh
118:46
God is releasing ho
118:50
I'm trying remember what do you call
118:52
like a truth beam a group of military
118:56
like what aliens yeah he's sending ho
118:59
battalions of the hosts that have flesh
119:01
on them and they were the ones that
119:03
fought against the armies of Israel they
119:06
actually fought in the flesh and fought
119:09
against the flesh they are being
119:11
released into this earth to keep the
119:14
lives of those who say yes who say who
119:18
are willing who are bidden who say yes
119:20
and who live your life the way we should
119:23
is an example of Christ so there are
119:25
things gonna be change I'll be talking
119:26

119:28

119:48

or https://youtu.be/yUdrV8fbt5Q

00:01
let's welcome cat everyone up here okay
00:28
being the mother of three highly
00:32
anointed dancers who were born years
00:35
apart from each other
00:37
I planned mine being 1:15 I thought if I
00:40
ever have them being number three out of
00:44
15 I said if I ever have them I'm
00:47
planning them on purpose far apart so I
00:51
can enjoy my life in between and get to
00:54
know each one of them so I did I had
00:56
them five years apart within the same
00:59
month but five years apart except the
01:03
middle one
01:03
I needed seven years before I had to
01:06
turn off but God was amazing he gave
01:10
them all the exact same gift their
01:14
natural gift they will still use in
01:16
heaven is dance they've danced probably
01:18
some of them for 30 years some 25 years
01:21
and highly gifted they've raised the
01:24
debt by dancing they've had people more
01:27
actually healed by dancing they do
01:29
intercession and warfare by dancing so
01:32
much so that my middle daughter has
01:35
brass knuckles this big tattooed on the
01:37
top of her feet because there are
01:39
weapons of God God told her to do it and
01:43
so everywhere she goes she would have
01:45
pink hair purple hair she was on so you
01:47
think you could dance so she could
01:49
witness and testifies to the judges
01:51
because she had already been dancing
01:52
since she was four so what I think she's
01:55
like 20 something after 20 years of
01:58
dance she went said I'm going to testify
02:00
I know they won't put me all the way
02:02
through because I'll be preaching the
02:04
gospel at one point and they passed her
02:07
through every test she mentored sixty
02:09
other dancers who were going to be
02:11
trying out because they all had to wait
02:13
in a room
02:13
for five days as you waited for your
02:15
turn and the first day you showed up
02:18
they they gave you a test they played
02:20
music for 10 seconds have you passed
02:22
those judges you were in for the rest of
02:24
the thing and so every level she would
02:27
pass every level so she got her try on
02:29
the platform so she could testify and
02:32
her here at that time was cut a little
02:34
bit shorter but it was red with purple
02:36
overtones and she had her she had a Rose
02:40
of Sharon on her arm her brass knuckles
02:43
on her feet and it was modern dance so
02:45
she didn't have to wear shoes and this
02:48
was her moment they played the music and
02:50
she dances so powerfully anointed people
02:53
just sit there like stunned they don't
02:55
know what to do they don't know what it
02:56
is so they said and the whole time she's
02:59
preparing what she was going to save
03:01
them and so they said well we know who
03:04
you are you must be really hot they said
03:09
the wrong word so why are you here look
03:12
at you your cool tattoos and she stood
03:15
up with her moment she said you think
03:17
you know who I am but I'm a believer in
03:20
Jesus Christ I get my anointing from him
03:24
I dance and warfare and worship I
03:27
destroy the darkness through my
03:29
movements I make every movement I make
03:32
us for him it is to worship Him he is my
03:35
God I will serve no other and they all
03:40
were sitting there stunned and they
03:44
finally said we can't pass you through
03:45
nope nope nope nope we can't pleasure
03:48
they were so terrified thinking she
03:51
would do that while she did it on stage
03:52
she said I did not come to win I came to
03:57
testify to you that God has young people
04:00
in this earth so down on fire for him
04:03
who will not compromise with the world
04:06
but will make a stand for righteousness
04:07
and holiness and that's why I came and I
04:11
fulfilled my commission
04:15
and they centered and all of the younger
04:18
people cuz you know they're like what
04:20
1718 cent like that and they were so
04:23
angry because she was so powerful that
04:25
wasn't fair she said I didn't come to
04:27
win and every day they meet in this room
04:31
and they'd all get tweaked you know they
04:32
do their their thing trying to get
04:34
better
04:35
she helped every one of them with their
04:37
with their routines and she would make
04:39
them pray first and these kids were from
04:43
all over the world in every walk of life
04:46
in every ethnic group and they learned
04:49
to pray to Jesus and she was um she's
04:52
don't you ever stop praying he gave you
04:55
that gift I'll be rooting for every one
04:56
of you and so this is the heart of my
05:00
daughter's this is what they were raised
05:02
in that that was who they were they
05:05
weren't something else they never went
05:07
into the world to find out who they were
05:09
they knew they all still dance they all
05:12
still minister they performed some have
05:14
dance companies and and they're very
05:17
powerful and I'm blessed that God said
05:19
if you raise up in child and the way he
05:21
made them to be they will never depart
05:24
from that because it's knowing their
05:26
gift and being that gift so I love dance
05:29
I have 20 years of videos of taping I
05:33
was the videographer I don't have a clue
05:36
about dance myself I can't dance except
05:39
in one day and so I teach everybody when
05:40
they go somewhere I've been throwing out
05:42
a Jazzercise classes so that shows you
05:44
that was not my gift but we got to see
05:48
all these years of them using that gift
05:52
they never dropped it and one of them
05:54
has actually danced here before Kim my
05:57
daughter Kim and she wants to come back
06:01
she's gonna help me talk to you about
06:03
doing an arts a whole arts it's called
06:06
arts alive and they'll she'll teach
06:09
dance they have artists that will teach
06:11
art and they have others that will teach
06:13
worship you know powerful it's powerful
06:17
it's like a two day event and and people
06:20
come in for the first time learn how to
06:22
express yourself and dance so she has
06:24
two classes one for those who have
06:25
experience and those who have no
06:27
experience and you'll never be the same
06:29
again and like the fine art is beautiful
06:32
and amazing they teach you prophetic art
06:34
like with brushes and paints and stuff
06:36
and then the worship thing is phenomenal
06:38
and these are all experts in their field
06:40
professionals in their field and Kim
06:42
said as it was leaving mom make sure you
06:45
asked them and see if they want us to
06:47
come you know we would love to come yeah
06:52
she wants to very much come and do that
06:54
so I'll have to let her know the answers
06:56
yes but when they started because dance
07:00
is one of the hottest things done in the
07:02
throne room it's called in sums 149 it's
07:06
high praise read Psalms 149 it talks
07:10
about dance being high praise it binds
07:12
the enemy in fetters of iron it's a very
07:16
powerful weapon it is worship but it's
07:19
also warfare and I want you to know when
07:22
they first started the fire started
07:25
pouring down from heaven blue fire blue
07:28
fire was coming down all over this
07:30
platform it was around every single
07:32
dancer and then about halfway through
07:34
the line of Judah walked in that wall
07:37
right here huge lion it was Jesus and
07:41
receiving the honor and the praise they
07:44
were all dancing around him they didn't
07:46
couldn't probably see that the other
07:48
thing that happened was I almost never
07:50
see this but the Seraphim showed up the
07:54
Seraphim live over the throne in a cloud
07:58
of glory and they come down and they do
08:01
dance in the air above the throne their
08:03
heads are so on fire with blue fire
08:06
their hair is blue fire and they were
08:09
right up here in between these two areas
08:11
right here and they would dip down
08:13
and bring more release more fire in here
08:15
on the dancers so the throat the
08:18
throne-room was here today okay
08:20
receiving the honor and the praise from
08:23
the dancers it's a very glorious thing
08:25
in heaven to see that happen and so I
08:28
was delighted when I came and they
08:31
danced cuz I love to see that I love to
08:33
see it's very powerful and so truly one
08:37
of their dance directors was very ill
08:40
one time and so my oldest daughter and
08:42
my middle daughter who actually ended up
08:45
by teaching and taken over the studio
08:47
for a while
08:48
danced and she was raised up off her
08:50
deathbed and they did it for that
08:53
purpose they were interceding for her to
08:55
be made whole and she lived she was
08:58
raised up from the dead and she lived
09:00
another 10 years a wonderful the first
09:04
Christian dance company in our entire
09:06
city the company became 200 members in
09:09
the company and then the director needed
09:11
a new knee so my oldest daughter took
09:13
over the company and three studios and
09:16
worked all over for her and gave her all
09:18
the money and so because she loved her
09:21
because from the time she was 8 she had
09:23
taught her she used to dance the the
09:25
director with the New York City Ballet
09:27
and she had danced all over the world we
09:29
decided at one point I'm done with this
09:32
I'm giving myself to Jesus and she got
09:34
saved and came and started the father's
09:36
company and so powerfully effective
09:39
impacted our whole city and now Miss
09:42
Laury is in heaven watching right now so
09:45
so dance is something wonderful if
09:48
you're if you're any of your children
09:50
they had some guys that did too they
09:52
didn't wear tutus at anymore tights but
09:55
they were powerful dancers also and I
09:58
know people you say dance a picture all
09:59
ballet there's many other forms of dance
10:01
you know that they can be involved in
10:03
and and I loved it with your I was
10:07
trying to remember what the father calls
10:09
it and with your battle stick he calls
10:12
it a battle stick they have those in the
10:15
throne rooms and the men are the ones
10:17
who use them in the zone
10:19
I'm like wow they really got heaven here
10:22
today and some of you may not even
10:24
understand what I'm talking about but
10:26
it's a powerful thing to connect with
10:27
heaven and then you duplicate it down
10:30
here okay so if you don't have a church
10:33
this is a powerful place to come god
10:35
loves this place not that he doesn't
10:37
love other places but they give
10:39
everything to him their lives their
10:42
gifts and they do it on purpose and
10:44
intentionally and they're passionate
10:46
about it God loves to see passion and
10:49
his people he loves it when you respond
10:52
when you yell when you get excited when
10:54
you jump up and down he loves let me
10:57
tell you heaven is not a quiet place if
11:00
you're expecting it to change your
11:03
mindset because if you're 80 you won't
11:07
feel 80 in heaven you'd be like 20 and
11:10
if you're already young when you get
11:12
there you are so excited beyond reason
11:15
the things that you get to experience
11:16
and do in heaven they don't even have on
11:18
this earth heaven is not earth the earth
11:21
is only a shadow literally a shadow of
11:24
what is in heaven it's way beyond your
11:27
imagination don't ever limit God in your
11:30
lives even here not even here and so
11:33
never thought I would be chosen to do
11:35
this not ever in my wildest dreams I
11:38
didn't like talking to anybody I didn't
11:42
want anybody to hug me or touch me I was
11:47
a covert person from the beginning and
11:49
yet had to be a leader at age eight over
11:53
my siblings and help and then when as I
11:55
got older it just increased but I was a
11:57
very faithful and committed to help my
11:59
parents I was on my parents side that
12:02
did not make me popular with the rest of
12:05
my siblings and being a seer and having
12:08
supernatural discernment even when I'm
12:10
like eight nine and ten they didn't get
12:12
away with anything
12:13
I was literally know what they were
12:15
gonna do before they even got to do it
12:17
okay and so I've met and go retrieve
12:19
them or whatever they were thought they
12:20
were going to get into it never happened
12:22
and my mom would always say I'm leaving
12:24
you to be in charge the house will still
12:26
be here they won't burn it down
12:29
you know they won't have fights in the
12:31
streets I mean when you got that many
12:32
kids together and that many
12:34
personalities there's gonna be a lot of
12:35
action all the time
12:37
and so uh and in my husband that God
12:40
made me marry he said this is one I
12:43
chose before you were born this is who I
12:45
chose to you to marry I need you to
12:47
marry him I need the holy seed you're
12:49
gonna produce I mean this is how direct
12:51
God is with me how detailed he is with
12:53
me and he said you're gonna have three
12:55
daughters and I need them born into this
12:58
earth I tried to get out of having the
13:00
last one that didn't happen I am paid in
13:05
full right now okay
13:07
and I only have one that's not married
13:09
yet and she thinks you might want to be
13:12
I'm not quite sure about that we'll see
13:14
what happens nothing is for certain when
13:18
God's involved in your life and he's got
13:20
destiny for you he'll get you one way or
13:23
another okay and that is a that's a good
13:26
thing it's a god thing be excited for
13:29
your life he could have had you born 300
13:31
years ago nobody would be dressed the
13:34
way you're dressed nobody would have any
13:37
of the conveniences of things you would
13:38
have you know you'd be climbing on some
13:40
old wagon train hauling around behind
13:42
cow dung and flies whatever you find and
13:46
caught that's what you ate you might
13:49
have a bath once every three months no
13:51
tell me where that would take place and
13:53
I for one I always thank God that he had
13:56
me born now if it had not been the kind
14:01
of person I didn't like getting dirty I
14:02
didn't want to get wet I didn't like to
14:05
sweat that was me so shoving me back 300
14:10
years ago I've probably not have been a
14:11
happy person and so I'm always grateful
14:15
that I'm born in this special time on
14:17
the earth well we will see things never
14:20
seen before
14:21
on the earth really some things will
14:24
directly be sent from heaven right in
14:27
our midst in the most unusual unexpected
14:30
places a lot of these signs and wonders
14:34
will not be done even in the midst of a
14:36
huge big meeting with thousands of
14:39
people it may be done in your grocery
14:41
stores
14:41
[Music]
14:43
you may take you out through the wall in
14:47
the grocery store your left your cart
14:49
will be left behind take you somewhere
14:51
do some miraculous thing out bring you
14:53
back your your kosher cart will still be
14:55
there trust me nobody will take anything
14:59
out of it and these things will be so
15:02
spectacular he actually does intend to
15:04
use you he's not looking for holy
15:08
recruits out of some of the highest
15:10
known people you know they're all
15:11
important they did what they did in the
15:14
past but in this time God wants teams
15:16
and groups of people who are willing to
15:18
work together even though we're
15:20
different no don't wait for everything
15:23
trust me we have a team don't wait for
15:26
every person to line up with the way you
15:28
think they should be okay if God sent
15:33
them he sent them and he sent them for a
15:36
reason and you have to love all them and
15:39
let them use the gifts God put in them
15:41
and be excited about it because if all
15:44
you ever do is complain about those
15:46
people they're probably never gonna
15:48
change okay when you can be happy about
15:51
them and ask God to bless them you
15:54
actually be surprised at how wonderful
15:56
they are so you can't expect because
16:00
he's a powerful days that everything
16:02
will look perfect or be perfect it will
16:04
be powerful and there's a big difference
16:08
between perfect and powerful it will be
16:10
so powerful when we start coming
16:12
together and doing things when God says
16:15
to do it not wait five years to do it
16:17
but do it he said pray that my people
16:19
are willing in the day of my power that
16:23
means lay down your differences
16:25
you know don't wait for everything to be
16:27
perfect because we aren't any of us
16:30
actually perfect right we're all a work
16:33
in progress but if you have a passion
16:34
for him and what he wants and he brings
16:37
other people to be a part of that you
16:39
should be very excited I get excited all
16:42
the time although our whole group I
16:44
don't know of anybody who's perfect know
16:46
they're all still working on I'm still
16:49
working on it and so as long as you're
16:51
going in a forward motion
16:53
and not sitting and waiting on the side
16:55
you're gonna do something for God right
16:59
so I can tell you God is opening more
17:01
and more the eyes of the everyday
17:03
believer to begin to see into the spirit
17:06
realm because it's coming people go well
17:10
you say things yes I do say things and
17:12
because I do prophesy that might be in
17:15
that in the past that could been 10 or
17:16
20 years but that's not happening now I
17:18
know things I said seven years ago are
17:21
literally happening right now things God
17:24
showed me I would be doing is happening
17:26
now and that now is going to open up the
17:29
whole rest of the floodgate for a lot of
17:31
other things just to start accelerating
17:33
we've been in and accelerating the
17:35
season but more now in the not just the
17:38
acceleration but we're being motivated
17:39
to be thrown out there don't look in the
17:45
mirror and say I don't qualify don't
17:47
ever say that word
17:48
you know why you qualify you're alive
17:53
guy said if you're still alive and
17:56
you're not in heaven yet you belong to
17:59
him you're qualified okay the world
18:03
won't we choose people that they think
18:06
qualified but God qualifies the chosen
18:11
it matters what he says about us it
18:14
matters how why he made us okay so no
18:18
matter what you think about yourself he
18:20
qualifies you I was just a little skinny
18:24
girl they didn't blend well with other
18:27
people at one point my line I think I
18:29
talked to two people in all of high
18:31
school they didn't really know who I was
18:33
but I was not the person they probably
18:36
thought I was I did a lot of covert
18:38
things even for the law they never would
18:41
have expected me the last person I'm
18:44
playing earth that they thought could
18:45
have done some of the things I did and
18:47
yet God qualifies me and I said yes
18:51
every time he asked me something and I
18:53
didn't always have the best attitude
18:55
growing up I wasn't happy about most
18:57
things I didn't like almost no food I
18:59
never slept I mean I was a lot of high
19:01
maintenance for my mom and she'll assure
19:03
you of that if she was here right now
19:05
she would tell me live
19:07
every day in my life of a strange
19:10
because I didn't fit the rest of the
19:13
group you know everybody ate everything
19:15
they slept normal they did what was
19:18
expected I never did anything that was
19:20
expected
19:21
I ate once a day that was about 1:00 or
19:23
2:00 in the morning while everybody was
19:24
sleeping I sleep four hours a day so I'm
19:28
up 20 hours a day what was I gonna do
19:30
for the extra time I read I was an avid
19:33
reader I read things that were exciting
19:35
and interesting I'm an avid horse lover
19:38
although I don't know one I'm sure I
19:40
have a herd in heaven and I was
19:43
fascinated with him you know in the
19:45
Bible God talks so much about the horse
19:46
he thinks it's one of the best things he
19:48
ever made in the animal kingdom he loves
19:52
horses and we're kind of in horse
19:55
country right now right I plan one day
19:58
to have a range somewhere around here
19:59
with a whole lot of horses I'm not
20:04
making that up and serious about that I
20:06
can come and visit my friends and get
20:10
away I'll have to get away to places
20:12
already planned in Maine because God
20:14
said the demand will be so great he'll
20:16
have to just take me and I'm perfectly
20:20
happy with that - so get ready to not be
20:23
normal or think normal and and I will
20:26
tell you just watch out for the quiet
20:28
ones you have a child that's quiet there
20:33
a very deep thinker and God has put a
20:36
lot in them and I always know when I
20:39
look around see people real quiet mm-hmm
20:44
God is gonna do something with you and
20:46
stick you out there in front of
20:48
everybody
20:51
because I was the core I was the quiet
20:53
when I hardly said anything but all the
20:56
time things were going on and the spirit
20:57
around me and so I'm excited today to be
21:01
here I have given up so much already
21:03
last night was so powerful
21:07
it was phenomenal it was so powerful it
21:11
really was it was amazing and so I
21:15
always like to ask how many people have
21:16
never heard me before that are here
21:18
today any new people a couple people
21:22
well I don't look normal
21:26
unless you live in a kurta certain
21:29
states couple states you know maybe
21:31
Portland they have a lot of highlights
21:32
in their hair some places in California
21:35
do but I learned not everybody does
21:37
I learn literally last week for a whole
21:41
week was in Hollywood going over a
21:44
contract to get a spirit round content
21:47
for a movie being made right now and
21:50
that is the resurrection of Jesus Christ
21:52
to put things in there that people have
21:56
seen in the Bible but maybe didn't have
21:57
revelation on it it will be live on the
22:01
big screen and people will be shocked
22:04
and stunned to know what Christ did in
22:07
hell on the third day any man how he
22:10
wasted hell in their leader is gonna be
22:13
very powerful and just in case anybody
22:16
wondered God loves colored highlights in
22:18
your hair because you're wearing heaven
22:21
culture this is heaven culture on my
22:24
head when a lot of people go why you do
22:26
that you know some places in Florida
22:29
have highlights that I don't think West
22:30
Virginia
22:34
not much in South Carolina you know
22:38
unless you're a headline or somewhere
22:39
maybe but when I used to travel through
22:42
those areas they would come out of the
22:43
kitchen they would come out of the
22:46
kitchen where they were cooking to see
22:48
who I was when it would stop but there
22:50
were little barbecue places or something
22:52
like that they all would get around my
22:53
table and I'm just waiting for their
22:55
little but we had a meeting right there
22:58
and it was all talking about heaven and
23:00
how they lived in heaven and how
23:02
exciting powerful was and they walked
23:04
away so stunned you know oh my god am i
23:07
lights in heaven and we can't have them
23:09
where we work I want to start prayin it
23:12
is coming it's gonna become normal just
23:15
like pierced ears if you weren't around
23:17
in that day they thought you were gonna
23:19
go straight to hell if you pierced ears
23:21
because you were doing idol worship you
23:23
know like back in Leviticus well we
23:25
don't live in Leviticus days and I
23:28
always like to correct people the way
23:30
they quote scriptures although some of
23:31
the translations now actually says don't
23:34
realize yourself to be tattooed they
23:36
mistranslated that because what it says
23:38
no Leviticus it says do not marks do not
23:40
allow marks of the Dead to be put on
23:43
your body they didn't say don't mark
23:45
yourself you have marks in heaven that
23:49
God puts on you it's what you put on you
23:52
and the reason you put them on you and I
23:54
have to say that even though people
23:56
might be uncomfortable you may be living
23:58
in heaven a point at one point wondering
24:00
why God ever said that and then you'll
24:01
get some yourself but it's coming
24:05
because as we go through time in it's a
24:08
new time
24:09
new things are introduced on the earth
24:11
some men kind of comes goes along with
24:14
but some of them actually come from
24:15
heaven and God at one point will ask
24:17
people personally to put his marks on
24:21
them like my daughter
24:22
the brass knuckles on her feet that was
24:24
before that actually was going around in
24:26
our city and and she wore sandals in
24:30
Florida where foot flops or sandals so
24:31
nobody could miss them right and they
24:33
knew what she did but when they looked
24:35
down on her feet Oh
24:36
do you know you like I don't know your
24:40
daughter has tattoos of the enemy oh no
24:43
no that's evidence that she's a gift to
24:46
crush the enemy that's what those are
24:49
there for so for all of you who ever
24:52
wondered about that God will mark you
24:54
when you get to heaven it says in the
24:56
Bible that you'll have the mark of the
24:58
city of your God in your forehead and
25:00
your God in the palm of your hand which
25:03
is why Satan wants to use those same two
25:06
places in the tribulation why did he
25:09
pick those two places it clearly says
25:11
that that that number of the item to
25:14
Christ will be in your palm or in your
25:17
forehead he only picks what God already
25:20
has you can't think of anything new
25:23
himself the microchip is not the mark of
25:27
the beast and neither is the barcode
25:31
which they thought it was before the
25:33
chip came along for forever and ever
25:36
mankind has tried to picture it so
25:38
usually in a tract of stuff they just
25:40
put a big 666 on the forehead or the
25:43
person that in the Bible track to
25:45
explain that this was someone who gave
25:47
themselves to Satan in the in those days
25:49
that haven't come yet and aren't going
25:50
to be for quite a while but the barcode
25:53
and the microchip especially in
25:55
microchip does it wouldn't count you
25:58
can't see it say Amen I know if enough
26:02
about Satan that whatever he does pick
26:04
will be this big you see a half a mile
26:07
away people walking down the street
26:08
because he is adamant about being known
26:11
and wanted and that day people will have
26:15
to want that mark no one can be forced
26:18
at gunpoint to take it a lot of these
26:21
movies they show about the last days
26:23
they show people in in cells with guns
26:25
and stuff threatening them to get it
26:27
that won't happen
26:28
that's not reality reality is they will
26:31
have to choose him as their leader and
26:33
that is a result of choosing the
26:37
Antichrist or Satan as their leader that
26:39
mark that will be clearly seen on the
26:42
people will be put on them so forget the
26:45
microchip it's just a good science you
26:48
know thing to help find people and
26:50
your pets and stuff or maybe save the
26:52
fact that you don't have to carry
26:53
wallets around with you they're always
26:55
going to be coming up with new
26:57
technology no one has technology like
26:59
heaven okay so don't worry about it it's
27:03
not your job to be concerned about any
27:05
of that and God wouldn't let you take
27:06
something that wasn't him anyway you
27:09
have to remember that you belong to him
27:11
you gave yourself to him that is not
27:13
gonna be something that's hidden when
27:15
that day comes it will not be hidden the
27:18
people who live in that time will
27:20
clearly know what they're saying no to
27:22
or what they're accepting your job is to
27:25
rule and reign in the power of the
27:27
Living God and ways never done before
27:29
you're living in one of those exciting
27:31
times to be alive on the planet and the
27:34
Bible says if people who live in heaven
27:37
could come back it would only be to do
27:38
that with you to be a part of this time
27:42
doing the supernatural manifesting for
27:45
your God on this earth the rain erasing
27:48
the great area that says there is not a
27:49
God so that's what they would come back
27:52
for amen but you're here you're here
27:56
you're in this meeting and you'll be
27:59
held accountable by knowing that you
28:02
were chosen you're breathing you're
28:05
alive you're not in heaven okay so he's
28:08
letting anyone who wants to to be a part
28:11
of what he's doing in this earth you
28:12
just have to understand don't try to
28:14
escape don't think that you can live out
28:16
the time waiting for the rapture to come
28:19
and I am NOT saying it's not coming he
28:23
is clearly going to come back when the
28:25
father sends him what Christ wants you
28:28
to do is operate in his power say his
28:32
power supernatural power in front of
28:37
others to demonstrate there is a God so
28:44
in the past people were you know they go
28:47
door to door and you can still do that
28:48
minister to people when people - cries
28:50
it's gonna be done a little bit
28:53
differently not that we'll ever be
28:54
stopped but there's a lot of people
28:57
who've already been approached people in
28:59
this day a lot of them know things that
29:02
people never knew in the past
29:03
a lot of its the internet has been used
29:05
for a lot of God not just evil and that
29:07
was made by God for His purposes it was
29:09
never made to be evil but Satan gets
29:11
involved in every single thing he can
29:13
get away with don't let him get away
29:15
with anything with you okay I love what
29:19
she's helping she said that I say that
29:21
to him if I see him a lot who are you
29:23
fooling because I don't belong to you
29:26
I'm talking about Satan appearing I
29:28
don't belong to you why are you here
29:31
you're wasting your time I know I have
29:35
authority I know I have power over all
29:37
the power of you and all of yours so you
29:41
don't waste your time coming here and
29:44
then he leaves because I put myself
29:48
under the hand of God no I'm not afraid
29:52
of anything I've already been told by
29:58
God if anybody tries to take me my life
30:00
they will not let them and if you know
30:05
somebody wants to take your life I will
30:07
not allow you to pray for them that
30:09
means they're in very big trouble
30:13
so I don't have any fear and I'm willing
30:16
whatever God wants however long he wants
30:18
to say whatever he wants and I'll have a
30:21
great opportunity to do that now I'm
30:23
because of but I'll be involved in I'll
30:25
get to meet kings and CEOs and
30:27
millionaires and I promise you they'll
30:30
hear from God Hollywood's gonna have a
30:35
lot of God in it amen and I was just a
30:42
little skinny girl that's what I was as
30:45
what people thought it was and then
30:46
later on when I got involved in my
30:49
church I loved my church I served in my
30:51
church I loved my pastor and his wife
30:54
I was very committed and sold out to
30:56
them and one day God had me write a
30:59
letter and say I was married to them
31:01
and they read that letter in church she
31:03
didn't read my name and they wept and
31:05
they said we wished everyone here loved
31:07
us that much that they were committed to
31:10
hold up our hands to pray for us every
31:12
day to help us in any way they wanted to
31:15
I was serious
31:16
God sent me there to be a blessing amen
31:19
that meant scrubbing the floors working
31:21
in children's church doing VBS I have
31:24
another word for that and won't tell you
31:26
what I think about that it's a killing
31:29
station not for the kids question when
31:40
you're stuck with the 7 year old so 8
31:42
year old the three and four year olds
31:44
were easy when you start thinking you
31:47
have a mind of your own it changes this
31:52
one little boy I had was like a thorn in
31:54
my flesh
31:56
he always had a better idea it did not
31:58
matter what we had prepared in VBS you
32:01
have to have if you are not prepared you
32:03
will have in our key and mayhem you will
32:07
be overthrown like a government by well
32:13
prepared children so you have to have
32:16
exciting fun things for them to do but
32:18
this one kid always had a better idea
32:22
every single name was Micah I should
32:25
have been suspecting he always wanted to
32:28
do it his way which was messing up the
32:30
plan that kid is such a peril of each
32:34
list
32:36
go is SiC him on the devil he's very
32:41
powerful when man I guess it was worth
32:44
it
32:44
loving him anyway it is fun to see those
32:49
you help as children be raised up and be
32:52
so powerful to forgot I'm gonna I knew
32:54
you were gonna become something so it's
33:00
wonderful to have a life sewn to God
33:04
even in your in perfectness even in your
33:07
mistakes even in all those things God
33:10
looks at your heart and he loves every
33:15
one of you even if you feel alone
33:18
yourself you are not alone you have
33:22
angels around you everyone here has
33:25
angels everyone in here has probably at
33:27
least 3 to 5 angels you don't have just
33:31
one some of you have a lot and most of
33:36
them are very happy right now that
33:37
you're sitting in those seats because
33:41
every word ice because anointing in it
33:43
and it goes in your soul whether you
33:44
know that or not the words won't leave
33:47
your soul because God wants you to know
33:51
you are powerfully made you are so
33:55
powerfully made if you ever really saw
33:58
who you were you would be so bold the
34:01
devil would get so terrified he doesn't
34:04
attack you because he's afraid he
34:07
doesn't attack you because he's angry he
34:12
doesn't get angry he's too smart to be
34:16
angry he knows what happens when he
34:17
makes people angry
34:19
he's gets you stuck but he does attack
34:24
you because he's terrified of you and
34:27
he's hoping you never ever find out who
34:31
you are
34:33
I've even said this in a men's prison
34:38
Danone Yin began to hit every one of
34:40
them the anointing they carried because
34:42
you got you're given an anointing for
34:45
some purpose they're very anointing
34:46
begin I can see it begin to rise out and
34:49
come and discover them and they begin to
34:51
weep they begin to shake they never
34:53
thought of their self that way I'm sure
34:55
nobody ever came and told them that
34:57
their treasures hidden in darkness so
35:01
when light comes in and removes the
35:03
scales off of their eyes then they get
35:06
angry at Satan even though they know
35:11
what they did was wrong and they're
35:12
paying a price for that they get
35:14
anything that he trapped him he trapped
35:16
them he hunted them he got them to fall
35:20
he kept encouraging them to do wrong
35:22
then he made them get caught how about
35:26
man he might have been put away where
35:29
they would never get to be who they were
35:32
sent to be and every time I go speak
35:36
everything every one of the men got
35:38
saved filled with the Holy Spirit and
35:39
then I really saw fire of God into them
35:41
I said whatever God has planned for you
35:45
you can be powerful right here you can
35:47
make a difference right here don't you
35:48
let one demon show their face in this
35:50
place don't you let them think they have
35:52
authority over you belong to Jesus
35:54
Christ you are now a weapon for God in
35:57
this place and sometimes ho blocks and
36:01
the prison would get saved including the
36:04
warden because of these people running
36:08
after Jesus Christ letting him work
36:11
Foley through them even in the prisons
36:15
there's gonna be movement from the
36:17
prison's one day
36:20
so maybe you're not in a building but
36:22
you're in a prison don't stay there
36:28
god I declare every person in this room
36:31
right now that has been chosen by you
36:34
that belongs to you that has a divine
36:36
purpose I take power over all the part
36:39
of the enemy trying to control any of
36:40
them steal their destiny crush them beat
36:43
them up in Jesus name I command the
36:45
hosts of heaven you get in here right
36:46
now
36:47
you pull down every stronghold you shred
36:51
every platform
36:52
Satan's been running over in their lives
36:54
right now that they might be free free
36:57
free everybody out free free in Jesus
37:00
name Amen amen that's how you pray over
37:07
your family get serious about it
37:11
amen then celebrate because your words
37:15
are powerful they have life in them they
37:17
have power in them if Christ lives in
37:20
you when you speak it's like him
37:21
speaking amen so you are important to
37:26
God every person is important there was
37:30
a lot of them messed up out there they
37:32
don't even know who he is don't know how
37:35
much he loves them but the moves that
37:38
are coming in the habitation that is
37:39
coming to this earth they will know he's
37:44
going to move on every single person
37:46
without permission I know you said well
37:51
they have to have permission sometimes
37:52
they do sometimes things are sovereignly
37:53
done and this already been declared in
37:56
the world in the last days what does he
38:00
say do you ever think that through in
38:03
your head I will pour out my spirit on
38:07
all flesh that means everybody on the
38:12
earth without permission I know what
38:17
that feels like begin to burn on the
38:20
inside of you too you think you're going
38:21
to explode then the flood of the life of
38:24
God comes in on top of that burning and
38:27
it actually comes out of the pores of
38:29
your body
38:30
it consumes your whole head it begins to
38:33
erase things on your soul the walls of
38:37
your soul he begins to bleach them white
38:40
from things that happen to you in the
38:42
past or maybe you even did in the past
38:45
it will be like you there's no way to
38:47
remember it because it's gone and people
38:51
when that begins to happen through
38:53
things will happen they'll either run to
38:55
God or run into the darkness and both of
39:01
those things will happen but a lot of
39:03
them will run after God they'll actually
39:04
drag people out of home he's an ass and
39:06
do you know who God is do you know him
39:07
do you know him on the street do you
39:09
know him do you know him do you know him
39:10
do you know him
39:11
I just felt him I need to know who he is
39:15
it'll be happening everywhere even in
39:20
churches your neighbors have been
39:27
watching you knowing how you live your
39:29
life maybe making fun of you or
39:31
harassing you or something they won't be
39:33
doing that when that happens they don't
39:36
pound your door down until you answer it
39:42
there's gonna be a hunger predators like
39:45
never before since this earth was made
39:47
to know the one who made them if you're
39:51
young you have a powerful life ahead of
39:54
you if you're not young ask to be
40:08
timeless because he's into restoring you
40:16
that means the way you look and the way
40:20
you feel
40:26
you have to declare you have to declare
40:29
it you have to declare it I know that
40:34
works the whole thing about whatever you
40:37
say your words if you don't waste your
40:41
words and a bunch of crazy stupid stuff
40:43
but you make them very focused you've
40:47
already learned one of the biggest
40:48
secrets in the Bible you should have
40:52
whatsoever you say he really means that
40:57
if it's not for something you know just
41:00
to spoil on yourself it's not just about
41:03
you now being timeless is not just a
41:05
view he wants you to be timeless how
41:08
will restore your youth how many people
41:12
have been saying that when I was young I
41:16
was smart when I was young I would read
41:19
stuff and then I actually believed it in
41:21
the Bible I literally believed it and so
41:25
I would act on it when I was young even
41:27
though it was quiet out to people I was
41:29
never quiet to God go in my room when I
41:33
had a moment to myself at a dorm room
41:35
with my four sisters at home I go out in
41:41
the yard at 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning
41:43
cuz nobody was out there but the frogs
41:45
lizards no alligators but a lot of other
41:49
creatures were in Florida you got at
41:51
night you're gonna find some don't worry
41:54
the alligators don't walk around like
41:55
dogs unless they've been trained to walk
42:00
on a leash then maybe people do crazy
42:03
stuff there I would just get along god I
42:05
would start saying to his word to him
42:07
your word says this okay
42:10
I'm not participating with the change in
42:12
my life when that thing comes it sounds
42:14
like a curse to me you know when women
42:16
go through the change I have seen women
42:20
in my life goes I said that sounds like
42:22
a curse I'm not I'm not under the curse
42:23
I was just clearing I will not
42:26
participate in any way whatsoever I'm
42:28

42:38
I woke up I was done I didn't have one
42:42
symptom not one single symptom of
42:44
anything
42:46
I was not participating with it so if
42:50
you're young girls say it you don't have
42:55
to participate okay to me that looked
42:59
like a curse I wasn't going to have it I
43:01
believed it and I said it and I reminded
43:04
my god I've been born again I'm no
43:07
longer under the curse I received
43:09
nothing of the curse so I don't want age
43:12
I started adding age I don't want to
43:14
look old no matter how old I am I don't
43:17
want to look codon won't ever be old I
43:19
always want to be new every day and I'm
43:22

47:24
where's the horse Rick it's the first
47:27
John 2:27 yes yes when you become born
47:35
again you get a deposit of anointing and
47:38
it abides that means lives in you that
47:41
anointing the anointing that Christ
47:43
operated in that anointing that someone
47:46
touched the hem of his garment and
47:47
healed him the anointing that Peter and
47:49
Paul uses so much there was a cloud of
47:51
it around them you have it whatever you
47:56
put it on it won't ever wash off or wear
47:59

touches that handle I do this we've had
48:10
testimony from people who actually
48:11
tested it in family members who were
48:15
angry for 20 years
48:17
got restored them because they had so
48:19
much in the anointing of John they touch
48:20
the refrigerator handle it would go up
48:24
in them the anointing breaks the yoke at
48:30
the workplace make sure you're using it
48:32

48:45
break room I touched every table they
48:49
didn't have cameras way back then they
48:51

49:07
they would not swear around me they just
49:10
they wouldn't know what to say sometimes
49:12
because that was their normal length but
49:14
you know talking about languages that
49:16
was their normal language when I came
49:17
around I just didn't say anything they
49:18
just take their head and wave didn't
49:22
want to swear I would really see no we
49:26
had so many people get saved in that
49:28
company cuz the anointing was on
49:31
everything it was in the floors and the
49:34
walls I was gonna make sure I coated it
49:37
you don't ever run out your favorite
49:42
restaurant make sure you leave it in the
49:44
tables you know drop something and touch
49:47
the floor you can wash your hand later
49:49
because it literally comes out of you I
49:54
got a real creative eye I put it on the
49:56
wheels in my car and the anointing is
50:01
like fire if you can see it it looks
50:03
like fire so when I Drive fire tracks
50:06
everywhere I go people cross over them
50:08
they drive over them you know when he
50:10
goes up inside their car it gets on them
50:13
see you can be creative you give me do
50:16
covert operations till he throws you out
50:18
there you know I'm because the more you
50:21
use it the more powerful it becomes it
50:26
does something else it burns the demons
50:31
like you put a flame torch on you that's
50:35
what it does to them they don't like
50:38
that fire that's God's fire so how about
50:42
that run them out of your neighborhood
50:44
oh yeah Jen like Glen you see when you
50:52
see stuff there's residue left by other
50:54
people who are really looking they leave
50:57
a residue of the enemy and so we see
51:00
that when we go places before I sit down
51:01
anywhere now I will touch that seat and
51:04
I'll say I'll cleanse it for the kingdom
51:05
and then the fire of God does this and
51:10
removes it in hotel rooms
51:15
oh my hotel is in my favorite place you
51:19
know what I do it's 3:00 in the morning
51:20
I walk down the hall in touch every door
51:23
now I know they have cameras I don't
51:25
what they think but I'm not doing
51:26
anything harmful when I check in I let
51:28
them know I pray you may see me in the
51:31
hallways I'm just praying for a big
51:32
never oh well that's lovely thank you
51:35
for giving me permission
51:39
because I released it before I get in
51:40
the hotel I send the host to drive every
51:44
demon out of every hotel I'm not
51:47
tolerating him around me and I see them
51:49
running out okay I see the host going
51:52
there and literally running them out
51:54
then I released the life of God into the
51:57
hotel even into the whole place you know
52:00
how people sometimes don't treat you
52:01
nice we always get treated nice because
52:03
they're actually beginning to bask in
52:05
the anointing that's covering the entire
52:07
counter that they are touching as they
52:10
register me I do get upgrades I put it
52:17
in the planes I put it in every Airport
52:20
I'm not gonna waste my life just walking
52:23
around breathing everywhere you go you
52:26
can do something people said I like to
52:32
pierce a demon we release the anointing
52:34
you physically is a physical person
52:40
cannot attack a demon just in case you
52:42
ever wondered there are spiritual beings
52:45
but you have spiritual weapons in you
52:48
there can be leashed upon them I'll go
52:54
by places that I know you know places of
52:56
ill repute that's the nicest way to say
52:58
it I will send the anointing in there
53:00
like fire and I can see through the
53:03
walls I see the demons streaming as it
53:05
hits them they begin to scream and ride
53:09
then they're burning in this fire from
53:11
God the place gets extremely boring
53:15
because there's nothing in there to and
53:17
you know empower sin or whatever's going
53:20
on my one sister not Jen I say that I
53:24
have a sister who was kidnapped and
53:27
dragged away when she was young we
53:29
prayed her we finally got her back years
53:31
later and and she didn't trust anybody
53:34
but but right now limite she's a
53:35
firehouse she is on fire for God she is
53:37
she is so destroying places of darkness
53:41
you know that demonic and everything
53:43
she's also a seer and in her life
53:45
there's time in her life but she would
53:47
dance in clubs and she knew every time I
53:50
drove by
53:53
seriously would tell me this she said
53:57
you know I know you drove by earlier
53:59
today didn't you why yes I did she said
54:02
the men fell asleep on the counters
54:04
[Laughter]
54:09
and she would stand there dancing and
54:13
she look at the paper we may as well go
54:15
home my sister just override she's
54:20
released to fire God in here and every
54:22
demon is left my family's very real
54:26
wasn't so God did something even better
54:34
than at a time when we didn't have a
54:36
place he moved me in with her her places
54:38
one of the place that I slept on the
54:40
floor there was so much anointing you
54:43
would float in it when he came in the
54:45
door and she finally came in one day
54:48
literally threw her stuff her bags and
54:51
I'm giving up I cannot do this anymore
54:57
I come home there's anointing I'm gonna
55:02
work you've release the anointing it's
55:04
in the clothes I'm wearing it's in my
55:07
closet it's in my bag I'm carrying I'm
55:12
just gonna have to leave and she quit so
55:22
if God has moved you in family there is
55:24
a reason please release it so no one can
55:29
tell me this doesn't work you can't tell
55:31
me it's too late she would literally
55:34
call me this place is dead
55:41
and we actually did shut a place down
55:43
literally it was one of the biggest
55:47
clubs and I kept declaring that it would
55:51
be taken to the ground there wouldn't be
55:53
a brick left because it sucked up the
55:55
lives of young girls who my sister would
55:59
win to the Lord while she was in that
56:01
club and she told me you don't have to
56:04
live like this I know Jesus Christ is
56:07
this crazy she's running from him but
56:09
she said I know I can help you
56:11
you can quit God can give you a life I
56:13
know you have children I know you hate
56:15
this they usually do most all of them
56:17
heat it and she says so I'm gonna go
56:20
pray with you back here i'ma lay hands
56:21
on Jesus crazy she said I know I still
56:24
have anointing it's been really dormant
56:25
but I'm gonna pray for you to receive
56:27
Jesus Christ and if you do this I will
56:29
promise you she'll find a better job and
56:32
every single time it worked for her
56:33
every time these girls want to be
56:36
mentored by her but she wasn't even
56:38
serving god
56:39
she said no I'll show you a place you
56:41
can go and go and get fed spiritually
56:43
and she said I know one day I'll have to
56:46
give up what God finally got tired of
56:47
waiting on him so he moved me in
56:54
the anointing breaks the yoke and you
57:01
can't deny you have it there is a
57:04
scripture that talks about it and if I
57:08
say these words the anointing does what
57:10
everyone in the room knows it breaks the
57:13
yoke well that's the anointing that's in
57:16
first John 2:27 did you get a deposit
57:19
off when you received Christ how long
57:21
ago was that it's been sitting in you
57:26
waiting for you to let it out
57:30
the more you let it out it will come
57:33
outside your whole being it can't even
57:35
be contained inside it will be outside
57:38
you and sometimes listen to this if I
57:45
want you I could fill the whole room
57:46
with mine cuz so many years every day of
57:51
my life I loose it I feel it leaving me
57:57
when that woman touched the hem of His
57:59
garment in me to demand on that what did
58:02
Christ say he felt it leaving him that
58:12
was power that was the anointing that
58:15
totally healed that woman totally after
58:18
years it races people from the dead it
58:22
drives demons out of people it heals
58:24
people in this world because in that
58:27
world that's how they used it in this
58:28
world think send it over the internet
58:32
through every single phone call it will
58:36
go and if you don't do it guess what
58:39
it's not gonna happen just do it it's in
58:43
the Bible it was used in the Bible it
58:46
didn't go away God's never changed that
58:49
I teach children to do it so by the time
58:54
they're 30 they could probably feel like
58:58
a whole city block if not more by your
59:02
presence someday someone will walk
59:06
through a hospital when every person has
59:08
healed because you're walking down the
59:10
hall not even touching them it will be
59:13
the anointing that you carry every
59:19
missionary team should be training their
59:20
people wherever they go to release the
59:22
anointing okay there you go there's
59:29
where that there's that that's the
59:31
anointing the anointing you haven't
59:34
deposited up it's a deposit because when
59:36
you put it out you get more the more you
59:39
give out the more deposits the more you
59:42
never stop never stop I get mine I get I
59:44
get refilled all day long every single
59:46
day I get more and I release it in the
59:48
entire buildings I don't want the enemy
59:51
bad I wasn't born to live with him and
60:00
I'm never tolerating him in my presence
60:03
if you remember the bodies of the Christ
60:06
lived like this what would this world
60:10
look like by one simple thing not even
60:14
all the rest it's available just by one
60:17
little simple thing yes you could prove
60:21
as in the Word of God they're scripture
60:25
to back it up you have to be willing
60:27
well you have to even know first because
60:31
this is not always taught in church
60:35
every new Christian should be taught
60:38
about the anointing every single one
60:40
should know you are powerful you are
60:42
dangerous you have weapons against hell
60:43
built-in you put in you from the day you
60:46
receive Jesus Christ and no one can say
60:52
I don't want that they don't even have
60:55
to know you've used it it is a secret
61:00
weapon unless people need it and then
61:05
they come and ask when you lay hands on
61:07
them always always always release the
61:10
anointing always every time you shake a
61:13
hand say in your spirit every DS it's a
61:17
spiritual weapon
61:19
come here come up here I'm gonna show
61:21
you when you meet somebody somebody goes
61:24
you go I'm gonna say it out loud bits
61:25
with you and she says hi and ago hi how
61:29
are you doing the whole time I can feel
61:31
it going on in my arm into her arm so
61:34
you don't even have to tell people use
61:40
the anointing people if you don't even
61:45
want to know the the deeper higher stuff
61:50
that maybe boggles your mind sometimes
61:54
if you were in heaven some of the stuff
61:57
you saw would do that to your head if
61:59
you saw some of the army of heaven you'd
62:01
really you probably fall under chairs
62:05
they're fierce they have Spears coming
62:09
out of the entire body they go into the
62:12
camp an enemy and they spin and shred
62:15
their name is shredder they're my
62:20
friends in heaven you will have angels
62:25
as friends it won't be weird they've
62:29
always been there they've always been
62:30
made by God having a friend is not
62:33
worshiping they have assignments they're
62:36
very focused on their assignment on this
62:38
earth at this time because evil is still
62:40
here what did you think they were gonna
62:42
do one day what are they gonna do
62:46
sticking a little group somewhere in a
62:48
cloud when the devil's not here
62:52
seriously think about things like that
62:54
in your head sometimes they have
62:57
personalities they're exciting they like
62:59
things they have things they like that
63:00
things they don't like they have
63:02
opinions about you
63:07
now if they're your guardian angel they
63:09
always think you're perfect and amazing
63:14
they sometimes get frustrated they go
63:19
home for R&R that's why you need more
63:23
than one and we laugh but this is truth
63:28
[Music]
63:31
here our supernatural being carrying
63:35
their light of God and the glory is
63:37
wrapped around you and you're living
63:39
with humans they have conversations
63:46
we're gonna have a sitcom one day about
63:49
guardian angels it will be a comedy and
63:57
God is perfectly okay with that
64:02
sometimes it is comic comical for them
64:05
but when you do something when you do
64:10
something that is against the enemy when
64:13
you stand up for what is right they get
64:17
ecstatic they will yell they will run
64:21
you know that whole thing about getting
64:22
inside you running around the house
64:23
while when you're by yourself they do
64:26
that because they've been waiting yeah
64:34
[Applause]
64:36
in those two running oh god did you see
64:40
that did you hear what they said
64:46
[Applause]
64:49
they've been with you like forever when
64:55
day you'll ride the rush in heaven with
64:56
them that's a rollercoaster so yes they
65:03
will have kind of new lives at one point
65:05
because there's no more evil you know
65:08
especially the host
65:09
I think Gabriel's group is more probable
65:11
used to just connecting and giving
65:13
messages and stuff but the hosts all
65:15
they do is fight they fight the war they
65:17
fight the war they fight the war they
65:19
fight the war they fight their war they
65:20
fight their war they fight they war
65:21
that's what they do so one day they
65:24
won't have that they're gonna have fun
65:28
that's what they're gonna do they'll
65:36
probably escort us to new planets to
65:39
explore new planets so good to do
65:43
exciting things what they'll do and
65:46
we'll know them right now we need to
65:50
know God right that's what they want us
65:52
to do but one day their life will be
65:54
different and I know we're down here
65:57
most people in like natural people not
66:00
were the understanding how things
66:01
operate they God made them now he made
66:04
them first but we existed before they
66:06
did
66:07
I love these revelations before he made
66:12
the angels we existed in God that thing
66:18
about him being from the beginning to
66:20
the end and the beginning you were in
66:22
him you saw all that 90 verse 1 through
66:29
2 you were with him so he made this
66:40
statement to me one day because I talked
66:42
a lot about the angels because I know a
66:43
lot about them and God said yes they've
66:46
been with me for a long time I made them
66:49
a very long time ago in tribes they're
66:51
all made in tribes the army Gabriel's
66:54
Lucifer heads and ones he was over so
66:59
they're not there anymore
67:00
but there's still some that do worship
67:03
the Seraphim they still have some that
67:06
sing in heaven but we actually replace
67:08
all the worship angels that's why we
67:11
worship that's why they don't want you
67:12
to worship the ones the fallen ones they
67:15
were worship angels who literally would
67:18
go before the throne of God and worship
67:19
Him and they chose the one who was their
67:22
leader who was accreted being over him
67:25
that's why they cannot repent like they
67:28
can't repent amen but we existed we
67:32
always were in him we didn't just appear
67:34
it's not all of a sudden guy said I want
67:36
to make billions of little spiritual
67:37
beings and one day I'll send to the
67:40
earth they were always we were always in
67:41
him when there was just Melchizedek and
67:45
the living creatures and the word and
67:49
the Holy Spirit before he started making
67:51
stuff we were there living in and out
67:56
riding on the rainbow that's where you
67:59
were everyone who ever existed it came
68:02
from him eternity is in him that's why
68:04
he can take you anywhere that's your dad
68:09
amen so stand up for a minute we're
68:11
gonna declare something stuff in them
68:18
god I thank you that your children are
68:22
here today to hear about you to hear
68:24
about your plans for them to find out
68:26
who they are god I pray not one word
68:29
drops to the ground that was spoken to
68:30
them God that you will not let it leave
68:33
their being but they will hear it and
68:35
hear it over and over and over and over
68:36
God that they will be empowered and it
68:39
will be inspired and they will be set on
68:40
fire to pursue you and your son even
68:45
more that they will know the Holy Spirit
68:49
like their best friend because he wants
68:53
to be thank you god you made a special
68:57
if we were made in your image than we
69:00
are special if we're to operate just
69:03
like you operate that makes this even
69:05
more special put a burning desire in all
69:08
of their hearts God to be just like you
69:15
that was the whole point of Christ
69:17
donning so he could duplicate himself we
69:21
are not we will never be God but we are
69:24
the sons and daughters of God we were
69:29
loaned to our parents no matter what
69:35
they were like whether you loved him or
69:37
didn't want to be with him you were
69:39
loaned cuz we go home we're all brothers
69:43
and sisters in the Lord he is your
69:46
father
69:47
he is the one you came from he made you
69:51
in His image
69:53
people go isn't he just a spirit he has
69:55
a head he has a body or you would not
69:58
have one
69:59
he has arms his legs or you wouldn't
70:02
have any
70:04
he doesn't look strange he makes strange
70:07
things makes a lot of strange creatures
70:12
in heaven but we don't look strange but
70:15
we're supposed to live that way
70:19
Christel live just like him he spoke
70:24
where there was nothing and then there
70:26
was he puts power in our words he writes
70:31
things on our soul before he sends us
70:33
his hope is that you will come back so
70:38

70:40
Amalie your unsaved friends those that
70:43
work don't stop praying for them declare
70:46

they will not miss their destiny no
70:57
matter how they act or talk we want them
71:02
free amen
71:05
God wants more in heaven than in hell
71:10
people always talk about how many are
71:12
going to hell I have news for you I
71:14
don't think they'll ever be more in Hell
71:15
than in him
71:19
because he has a purpose and God I I
71:22
declare that they will know their
71:24
purpose they will run after that purpose
71:27
it will be powerful in this life and
71:31
receive great reward now and in the life
71:35

not just in heaven God let them have a
71:40
great harvest of finances in restoration
71:42
and love and joy and happiness in this
71:47
life God that they can demonstrate your
71:51
image and your character the people in
71:55
this earth that heaven is not boring God
71:56
is not boring yes he does love you he
71:59
does care but he is so holy to even
72:05
think that when you go home to heaven
72:06
you had the right to step inside of him
72:09
that's because he's got and you are his
72:12
child and he does purpose that Jesus
72:17
said father you and me and me and you I
72:19
pray that they will be one even as we
72:21
are one and he was talking about when
72:24
you come home to heaven you will step
72:26
inside the Father Christ will step
72:28
inside the Father Holy Spirit will step

00:37
before thank you Jesus
00:39
help them all I was never made to be
00:45
normal I'm one of 15 I'm number three
00:51
that means that was a mother at a Jay
00:55
stop as a helper if you never were part
00:59
of a big family a tribe you don't
01:00
understand that if you were you know
01:02
exactly what I'm talking about
01:03
you pretty much never had a life that
01:08
was your life you learned at a young age
01:10
to surrender you learned how to be in
01:12
charge you know how to to break up
01:17
fights to bring peace be adventurous and
01:22
exciting with the things you have them
01:24
do to keep them busy so they weren't
01:26
fighting how to feed that many people
01:30
how to make that much food i watch that
01:32
many dishes 150 every day peel 50 pounds
01:38
of potato once a week eight loads of
01:42
laundry a day I think we did like 60 a
01:44
week I helped with all of it
01:48
and so I learned at early age to hear
01:51
God for help my baby sister sitting on
01:56
the front row is number 15
01:59
I was like a second mom to her so we
02:06
grew up knowing each other really well
02:08
she lives with me has lived with me
02:10
since 1999 and so has my mom because my
02:14
dad decided to go home to heaven he's
02:17
having a wonderful time up there on his
02:19
ranch with all of our pets it's too late
02:23
to tell me they don't go there
02:25
it's the father's choice man there's
02:29
some things only he decides and if he
02:32
decides to do who's gonna argue it's too
02:34
late they're there I recognize many of
02:39
my pets I had him when I was like 7
02:42
you know much before that not a lot but
02:44
ever since that time although all the
02:46
pets I've ever had I've recognized all
02:48
of them and many of my siblings pets
02:50
they had our brother Joey's duck named
02:52
Max when he was 9 my brother's alligator
02:56
named Charlie that lived in our bathtub
02:58
until it was bath time my brother's
03:03
iguana lizard named Iggy they've done to
03:05
the downstairs closet which was also our
03:07
phone booth you know in the 50s and 60s
03:10
you had one phone with one line and it
03:12
was hooked to the wall and sometimes it
03:17
was a party line that doesn't mean it
03:18
was a party means you shared everybody's
03:21
conversation with whoever they were
03:23
talking to you until they were done
03:25
unless you could convince them you
03:27
really needed the phone so I grew up in
03:31
the time in the era before microwaves at
03:34
the very beginning of television when
03:35
you had a round screen it was black and
03:37
white and had five shows not a lot to
03:42
watch right we had a big old house we
03:46
had a big yard and all of our friends
03:49
wanted to come and visit us so that
03:51
means we had probably had 30 around 30
03:53
all the time in our yard and so we
03:56
learned how to get along with the rest
03:57
of the world just because we had to grow
04:00
up together
04:01
and my father knew God well the father
04:06
and the son in the Holy Spirit very well
04:08
so did his mother some seventh
04:10
generation of knowing
04:13
odd living for him loving for him and I
04:17
love everyone no matter the mistakes you
04:20
make even what you believe I know where
04:24
you came from you came from him he had
04:28
plans for everyone not everyone chose
04:30
his plans many people don't even know
04:33
him but he wants to know them so I have
04:37
a lot of Grace and I have unending
04:41
patience long-suffering and patience in
04:45
my life so I can put up with just about
04:47
anything all the time and God needed me
04:50
to be that way if I was going to share
04:52
his home to people all over the world no
04:57
matter what I would have thought about
04:58
them I changed I changed several times
05:02
in my life I got more and more like God
05:04
because there was supposed to be just
05:06
like him
05:07
I actually began to say that there was
05:09
nothing else to do except say it so I
05:11
used to stand and say God I want to be
05:13
just like you
05:15
now if you loved your father would you
05:18
say that about him
05:20
my brothers used to say that about my
05:22
earthly father I'm gonna be just like
05:24
you dad I said that about my Heavenly
05:26
Father I wanna be just like you I'm
05:30
gonna talk like you I want to act like
05:32
you want people to see you when they see
05:34
me I want them to hear you when they
05:36
hear me and I want to crush darkness and
05:46
so one day I was just minding my own
05:50
business which is God's business I was
05:53
speaking in a church I also speak in
05:55
many other places anyone who wants to
05:57
hear about heaven Ellen bite me they
05:59
have to get past the pink hair whoever
06:02
knew that that would be a stumbling
06:03
block right I've been the same and the
06:07
same as far as my relationship with God
06:09
since I was age 4 that's a very long
06:12
time 62 years I've known Jesus Christ
06:16
personally and so you know I knew he was
06:20
watching my life all the time I mean he
06:22
does live in us right he's not blind
06:26
but he still loves us he has hope for us
06:28
and he has a lot of hope for us because
06:31
Christ in us is the hope of so if he
06:35
lives in you you're not going to escape
06:37
carrying it and that means one day
06:40
you'll shine like the stars in the
06:42
heavens because the word says so so
06:46
before the one day I was going to tell
06:48
you about there was another time I was
06:49
in another city and I think we're out in
06:52
fairgrounds or something I don't
06:53
remember we had to go to ladies room
06:55
there were no lights all the lights had
06:57
blown out and that was a problem so I
07:00
went in there to see what was going on
07:02
when I walked in the door it was this
07:04
long big room and it was dark until I
07:07
opened the door and then it was light so
07:11
I started looking for the light I'm
07:13
literally looking where's the light
07:15
coming from I'm not kidding about any of
07:17
this and where's the light coming from
07:19
none of the lights are on but everywhere
07:21
I looked there was light until I looked
07:24
in the mirror it was coming from me I
07:31
was stunned but it was it was it was
07:36
overwhelming to me that I was seeing the
07:39
word alive in me but when you begin to
07:42
declare things about God or for God
07:45
those things are gonna start happening
07:46
in your life and I would tell people all
07:48
the time one day you shine like the
07:49
stars in the heavens because he does let
07:53
me tell you he shines I'm done my Jesus
07:56
Christ he's got so much glory coming
07:57
from you he can dim that glory if he
08:00
wants to but I've seen him full-out
08:02
glory like a million diamonds and I used
08:05
to be so undone whenever I would see him
08:08
and so I'm a little steam is still
08:10
staying in the ladies bathroom when
08:11
there's no light anywhere except coming
08:13
from me and what this is crazy so I
08:16
still thought well I know I can see it
08:18
in the mirror but let's look at all the
08:19
stalls so I opened every dough every
08:21
door and there was darkness till I went
08:23
in then it was light and I walked up and
08:26
down then it was fun I went up and down
08:28
everywhere in there and it was light
08:31
everywhere and I thought if somebody
08:32
needs to come in here now why the lights
08:37
by the lights shining right now you can
08:40
see whatever you need to do and so these
08:44
were just like I would call them random
08:47
encounters or instances that happened to
08:49
me most of my life but that was one that
08:52
really surprised even me and I heard the
08:56
Lord say did I not say you would shine
09:00
like the stars in the heavens that even
09:02
the night would be light round about you
09:06
and he was just saying the word to me
09:09
and he was confirming the word and so if
09:12
you're faithful to him he's gonna be
09:14
faithful to you and I know everyone's
09:16
been through hard times or they have
09:18
issues in their life or things that
09:20
they're facing that might not be easy
09:22
remember who he is and remember who you
09:26
are okay if you begin to remember who
09:31
you are according to the word you change
09:34
the way you look at everything and
09:37
sometimes nothing seems impossible I've
09:41
been in a lot of impossible places in my
09:45
life and it never touched me I made a
09:48
decision I'm not changing according to
09:51
circumstances or what people think of
09:52
what people say oh it is actually
09:54
happening I don't know what any of it
09:56
affects me because my hope is in him
09:59
my eternity is in him no man holds my
10:04
eternity in their hands it's in his
10:08
hands and I told people one time when we
10:11
had absolutely nothing and slept on
10:13
people's floors that wasn't to teach us
10:15
something that was to show other
10:18
something that no matter where you are
10:21
you can carry the glory you can shift
10:23
things change things by the decisions
10:25
you make and the choices you make every
10:27
day of your life it doesn't stop you
10:30
from ruling and reigning from Christ it
10:32
doesn't take away your authority and I
10:35
told somebody one time they're saying
10:36
well how are you holding up I want what
10:38
I'm up what am i holding up what are you
10:41
talking about well you know all the
10:43
things you're going through and I'm not
10:44
going to do anything I'm living my life
10:48
for Christ's no matter what's going on I
10:51
will move things I will not let things
10:53
move me now I begin to declare the
10:58
goodness of God over my life over my
11:00
family's life because I knew this was a
11:03
very short thing in my life I knew it
11:05
wasn't the devil how about that one it
11:09
was God showing people that you can live
11:12
powerfully no matter what's going on
11:14
around you about the decisions you
11:16
choose it can change things I didn't
11:21
change anything I did about my church I
11:23
still served I helped what I had I would
11:26
give I love people anyway I was
11:29
rejoicing every day of my life I chose
11:31
to be happy and we were saying with the
11:35
front sweeping on their floors and it
11:38
was my daughter's a fifth birthday and
11:40
you know what she was happy about
11:41
anything could because she had lived for
11:44
the hottest we trained our children to
11:47
know God Himself to know who he is what
11:49
his plans are for us and she just all
11:52
she wanted was a little baby doll
11:53
carriage and a baby doll and we couldn't
11:56
get any of that at the time because
11:57
things had but something had been taken
11:59
from us it wasn't us doing it we didn't
12:01
even curse the person and so there was a
12:04
sound outside the front door she was
12:07
awake she ran to the front door and
12:09
outside was a brand-new with a big bow
12:14
on it the most beautiful baby doll cares
12:17
I've seen in my life and the most
12:19
beautiful baby I've seen full of
12:22
accessories in this beautiful carriage
12:24
from someone who knew nothing about what
12:26
was going on and she ran out saying look
12:30
my present has arrived the Angels
12:34
brought us and and so we celebrated her
12:40
birthday it was awesome the next year
12:43
before the next year ended someone
12:46
walked up doesn't said here take this
12:48
and live here free for a year it was a
12:51
million dollar condo out at one of the
12:53
most exclusive places in our city at the
12:56
beach
12:57
[Music]
12:59
we didn't call this person we didn't
13:01
tell them anything we lived the same way
13:05
every day if we don't even living in
13:08
that place because we trusted God we
13:14
knew he held our future in his hands and
13:17
I refused to let the enemy have any fun
13:19
no I tormented him the entire time
13:23
because all I ever did was have a good
13:25
report I had a god report of what God
13:28
was saying about us amen
13:30
so no matter what it looks like start
13:32
worshiping him declaring who he is who
13:35
holds your future in his hand amen
13:39
because we're entering into powerful
13:41
times on this earth I've been talking
13:43
about this for a while but things are
13:45
literally starting to happen that I said
13:49
even 12 years ago literally happening
13:51
exactly the way God told me they would
13:53
happen and I'm here especially to do two
13:57
things I'm gonna talk about Trump I hope
14:00
you like him I hope you realize God does
14:08
not always choose the one we think is
14:10
better he chooses the one who is the
14:13
best for what he needs even my own mom
14:19
and she was here she came up and give
14:20
her a test my mom is a hoot she's a be
14:24
something I forget how old she is all
14:25
the time she calls people who are 69 old
14:29
but she never includes herself she
14:33
travels all over the world with me on no
14:35
medication she has no help to do
14:37
anything she's planning to live to be
14:39
120 unless God once or longer she'd like
14:44
to see my dad before them but she
14:45
understands he's having a good time so
14:47
she's okay with that but she's very
14:51
political and has been most of her life
14:55
because she knows what is right and what
14:58
is wrong and she has a plumb switch to
15:00
prove it
15:05
if you'd ever watch any my when I
15:08
campaigned this whole last term before
15:11
Trump was elected I had a lot of Trump
15:14
reports and my mom wanted to be in as
15:15
many she could on my facebook
15:17
she gave her own thoughts and opinions
15:19
on everything most of the time she had
15:22
her plumb switch with her people said we
15:26
need your mom my mom did speak her mind
15:28
but it was along the lines of what God
15:31
believed and purpose she knew what life
15:34
was she knew what death was she didn't
15:36
have a problem discerning them or
15:38
telling anyone which one to choose she
15:42
hasn't changed and she's still my mom
15:45
even though I'm in my 60s Jen's in her
15:47
40s our mom is still our mom and I can
15:53
probably hear her when she goes to
15:55
heaven one day giving me her opinions on
15:57
things she loves this place she loves
16:04
Pastor Dave and Dee Dee so much she's
16:09
getting ready for her next month when we
16:11
go on our british isles cruise she's
16:13
going to get to for the very first time
16:15
visit the land of her earthly ancestors
16:18
which is the irish she's a good example
16:23
of an irish look I'll tell you why and
16:27
she's expecting to have a lot of fun
16:30
amen so she's getting on her treadmill
16:34
getting in shape picking out her she
16:37
already got her suitcase packed I think
16:41
and so she has a lot of fun when she go
16:44
she will meet a hundred new people who
16:46
haul them all her friends so she still
16:49
enjoys her life she starts her own
16:53
prayer line yeah if people want children
16:56
if they if they're in a place where they
16:58
can have babies gate not saying if you
17:00
can have or not I'm saying if you want
17:02
them and you're married you're gonna
17:03
have one if she prays for you we have
17:06
had other evidence of here right here in
17:08
this church she pray for them I think it
17:11
was like nine months later their
17:14
daughter had a baby
17:16
and so my mom is serious that she'll
17:19
start a prayer line at meetings who
17:20
would like to have babies you must be
17:23
married because that is coming first and
17:33
she'll pray for him in every one of them
17:34
as far as we know every one of them has
17:35
had a baby that she prayed for him I
17:37
mean she will she'll make sure you
17:40
understand what it means to have one cuz
17:41
if anybody knows it would be her what's
17:44
gonna happen as the baby gets older this
17:46
is what you can expect don't be shocked
17:49
when this happens or this happens it's
17:51
all gonna be okay all this stuff is
17:53
normal you just give your life away for
17:56
about ten years and so she's a lot of
18:02
fun but my mom put a lot on me my dad
18:05
put a tremendous amount my mom put a lot
18:08
of the practical logical things that we
18:11
need to know how to treat people how to
18:13
be polite how to be a young lady cuz you
18:17
never know who you're gonna make sure
18:19
you always have clean underwear that was
18:23
always on the list every single day I
18:28
always do what Jen always wear your seat
18:32
belt or if you're in the car with her
18:34
she will put it on you herself and so
18:37
she does not want people to break the
18:39
law and she reminds us of it 24 hours a
18:41
day even if we're not even in other
18:44
countries I'm down you she's really on
18:47
top of things so she's a lot of fun my
18:49
dad was the most amazing person I knew
18:52
on the earth and I love to talk about
18:55
him but tonight he wants me to talk
18:57
about Trump in heaven they're rooting
19:01
for him I don't know what earth people
19:03
think about heaven knows that God picked
19:05
him and what he's already done for this
19:07
country proves that God picked him amen
19:11
and he's going to win in 2020 in case
19:16
you wonder write it down write it down
19:19
it's going to have
19:21
and he's only through like two years and
19:25
he's already created five million jobs
19:26
if you didn't know I know all the stats
19:30
I have friends who are part of the Trump
19:33
administration um I don't know him yet
19:36
but I will God said I would and I'm you
19:38
know when whenever that happens is good
19:40
with me but he's got a lot of things
19:42
planned he hasn't even talked about yet
19:44
I'm talking about the president I did
19:46
just come from the Trump 2020
19:50
announcement rally in Orlando Florida
19:55
it was so deafening you could hardly
19:58
hear anything from the people they had a
20:01
hundred thousand tickets but the place
20:02
only held 20-some thousand people so
20:04
everybody else was outside they had
20:07
Jumbotron set up and this is the honest
20:10
truth no matter what you've heard on the
20:11
news there were 35 hecklers
20:16
thirty-five against to the tens of
20:20
thousands which which came to cheer him
20:24
on and thank him for what he has done
20:26
and the thing about the hecklers because
20:30
I made sure I was outside most of the
20:31
time on purpose this time I was over
20:33
there by them releasing the anointing
20:35
into every one of them they needed help
20:41
if I was going to be one of them I would
20:44
have set up my stand I would have given
20:45
our plan I literally would have said
20:48
this is our plan for the Democratic
20:50
Party this is what we got planned it's
20:51
going to be great they didn't do that
20:52
all they could do was swear at Trump and
20:54
swear it people it was really sad so I
20:58
was praying all the time releasing the
21:00
anointing sending the host upholding on
21:01
the demonic off of them I mean I was
21:03
over here having a prayer warrior time
21:06
they couldn't scream over the sound of
21:10
the the jumbo screens they couldn't
21:14
because I was on the corner like right
21:16
here's the massive Amway Center that was
21:19
deafening was like a wave would come
21:20
from here from the jumbotron that wave
21:23
would come from here and I was being hit
21:24
by both waves and I didn't want to make
21:28
some statements because I'm a seer that
21:30
means I see the spirit or I'm not like I
21:32
see everybody's angels here everybody
21:34
say Thank You angel for putting up with
21:37
me loving me and watching over me making
21:46
work as much well I have to tell you
21:51
what exciting points of me being there
21:53
and I literally just came from Hollywood
21:56
from being there for seven days night
21:58
and day I'm gonna be part of giving
22:01
content I was sharing this last night I
22:02
literally um what I said seven years ago
22:06
what God has said to me I said it
22:08
happened this last week in Hollywood
22:11
they're starting up my contract to give
22:14
spiritual realm content for the
22:16
resurrection of Jesus Christ movie
22:18
that's being made in Hollywood
22:23
in Hollywood so you're gonna see the
22:27
truth
22:27
on the screen to the entire movie like
22:35
Colossians where Christ spoiled and
22:38
messed up the principalities and powers
22:41
in the midst of hell ruined their very
22:44
village forever stripped all the royal
22:46
robes off of Satan and took the
22:48
gemstones everyone that God put on him
22:51
according to Ezekiel 28 you will see him
22:53
pluck them off one at a time in the
22:56
movie leaving only the mountings that
22:58
held them you'll see him take the keys
23:01
of hell death in the grave
23:03
why the rush to the all of the hell that
23:05
was present to watch this show it was a
23:07
show clearly the word said Christ made a
23:11
show of it openly so he had a show in
23:15
hell
23:16
wasting hell in front of all of Hell
23:19
okay and you will see that in every
23:22
detail I can't tell you much more than
23:25
that but I promise you you will see that
23:26
in detail while people send up all of a
23:29
theater and scream for Jesus Christ
23:34
you'll see the depths of Hell where it
23:37
took place and the Bible says all
23:39
through the Bible as Jonah was in the
23:41
belly of the whale for three days so
23:42
we'll be in the earth God had a plan no
23:48
matter what anyone thought he had a plan
23:50
when he sent his son and on the day he
23:54
died which is actually in the garden
23:55
when he drank the cup you will also see
23:57
what he drank it won't be a thought in
24:02
your mind anymore because he died in the
24:04
garden he died to his own will he said
24:07
so if it's possible father take this cup
24:11
from me because he saw what he knew what
24:13
was in that cup evil the most worst evil
24:16
ever into his perfectly pure body
24:19
walking as a man righteous righteous
24:22
righteous with no sin asked to take that
24:25
that is what had to be nailed to the
24:28
cross not just his body that had to go
24:33
in this perfect body
24:35
every sin that could be committed had to
24:37
be nailed to the cross he is the only
24:39
one who can forgive because he's the
24:41
only one that drank that cup no one took
24:44
that inside of themselves and but was
24:46
nailed to the cross it was what was in
24:48
him that he had to drink in that garden
24:52
it was God's will and he couldn't even
24:55
look upon his son he couldn't hear his
24:59
father for that time he sets them on the
25:02
cross so this would be the most
25:04
different movie you'll ever see in your
25:06
life it will introduce the spirit realm
25:08
to all of Hollywood in the whole world
25:11
[Applause]
25:15
so yes I am excited because God is
25:20
taking Hollywood amen you'll see many
25:27
changes in some of the worst places in
25:29
our country here because God has always
25:32
planned to have them for himself Satan
25:34
has been ruling in these places for a
25:36
long time so he's very much afraid I
25:41
will not use the word angry there's a
25:45
difference in angry and terrified he
25:48
Satan is terrified he can't stop it cuz
25:54
Godin has somebody who's never gonna say
25:57
no who is not afraid of what the enemy
25:59
might do the enemy is afraid of what I
26:03
might do does the word say that if you
26:08
submit yourself under the hand of God
26:10
you know resisters I mean oh no I'm not
26:13
taking you I will not tolerate anything
26:18
you're offering me I'm gonna serve you I
26:22
serve the Most High God of heaven earth
26:24
I just polish you I'll never surrender
26:26
you don't waste your time get out
26:32
[Applause]
26:35
well that is how we're supposed to live
26:41
that as a manifested daughter of God
26:45
manifesting his power his plans his love
26:49
his ways his will by the way they live
26:56
it's not something you do every now and
26:58
then it is a lifestyle and they're
27:02
people and God made me take years to get
27:06
to this point so people would know who I
27:08
am and what I stand for and even how I
27:10
live it would be hard for someone to try
27:15
to bash me because most people wouldn't
27:17
believe it someone sees me the first
27:20
time I don't believe you I think you
27:20
lied about everything why don't you go
27:22
ask God you cannot hear him because you
27:26
should if you belong to him the word
27:29
says you not hear the voice of another
27:32
if you want truth go ask him and pursue
27:36
him until you hear it do you give up in
27:41
two weeks
27:42
how can you give you something that's
27:44
gonna take 50 years because some things
27:50
I've been waiting 50 years for and I
27:53
will still get it because I'm not giving
27:56
up and I'm not gonna step back I'll have
28:02
whatever he wants to give me and you
28:06
should be saying the same thing so
28:10
Hollywood is going to be wrecked by the
28:14
Most High God by the hosts of heaven
28:17
I've been bombarding Hollywood since I
28:19
left they're sending in sweeps of that
28:22
place ten billion hosts of heaven to
28:27
pull down every stronghold of Satan
28:29
every realm any high level being has
28:32
been ruling from there being shredded
28:38
the ones that can't will have their
28:40
mouth shut while I'm there because I
28:44
don't have to tolerate them God didn't
28:49
did he his son didn't did he
28:54
are we supposed to be just like them we
28:58
made in their image and after their
29:00
likeness which means the way they
29:02
operate were supposed to operate so when
29:05
the body finally gets that message and
29:07
they wake up stand up and stand out
29:09
you'll see many powerful changes and
29:13
shifts happens in this world there are
29:18
10 year-olds right now commanding an
29:20
army of the hosts of heaven and they've
29:23
been doing it for three years they wreak
29:27
havoc on hell the enemy runs from them
29:33
this is who we are we're not weak little
29:39
humans we may live in this world but you
29:44
are not you are an alien you're from
29:47
another world and God is serious about
29:53
us living on earth as they live in
29:54
heaven so this time for America is a
29:59
great time it will set things up for
30:02
many years to come
30:03
24 years of God in the White House will
30:06
happen
30:08
[Music]
30:10
[Applause]
30:12
so you can expect Trump to win in 2020
30:16
and then pence win for the next eight
30:17
years after that
30:19
and whoever pence picks his
30:22
vice-president will be president for
30:23
eight years eight years after that
30:27
twenty four years in the White House
30:29
maybe the Democrats should take a long
30:31
vacation and wait it out I'm trying to
30:40
help them it is sound advice you can
30:50
only talk like this if you've seen God
30:51
face to face and he told you that except
30:54
he doesn't just tell me he shows me when
30:58
Trump said he was winning God showed me
31:00
took me in Fisher and showed me
31:01
Trump sitting in the White House when
31:04
there's still 17 people in the
31:05
Republican group running against him God
31:08
said I will eliminate them one by one
31:11
they'll be forced to take him because
31:15
even the leaders didn't want him because
31:19
they couldn't control him they couldn't
31:21
scare him they couldn't buy him God
31:27
picked the right person so I know I
31:33
don't know who Pence is going to pick
31:35
but they will seriously consider it
31:38
they've already heard me declare all
31:40
this on the inaugural prayer breakfast
31:44
when they let me do the prayer or Trump
31:48
and pence I prophesied so I'm looking
31:56
forward to these years in my life don't
31:58
miss them don't sit on a rock somewhere
32:02
and just watch it go by be a part of it
32:07
because once you step out and start
32:09
doing something it just accelerates your
32:13
faith explodes when you begin to see God
32:16
do things quickly because we're in a
32:18
time of acceleration it will be quickly
32:21
we still have years left I don't always
32:24
tell how many years left I don't know
32:26
the date in time I know the event like
32:31
at one point there'll be I'm talking
32:33
about when there's no more time on the
32:34
earth I'm not talking about just the
32:38
millennial reign time not past that
32:40
because it's during them alone and ring
32:42
you know that's a thousand years right
32:44
how many people know that been to Israel
32:48
been to the temple I know that Christ
32:52
will sit on a throne for 1,000 years in
32:57
that place when no one is destroying
32:59
Israel if you've wondered about that
33:01
don't be concerned about it keep praying
33:03
for them God is blessing them the desert
33:06
is blooming like it never has before I
33:08
was there five years ago it was all
33:10
desert when I came this time because I
33:12
was also there for like I forgot how
33:14
many days it seemed like eternity I
33:17
didn't get to speak in a nice hotel I
33:19
actually had viewed the pilgrim his tour
33:21
where you went to Masada and every place
33:24
Jesus went then other you know Elijah
33:26
you know I'm not Carmel I was there I
33:29
was in the garden tomb where the two
33:31
angels who rolled the stone away are
33:32
still there I stood in the garden flower
33:36
bed where Christ did
33:38
that's why Mary thought he was the
33:40
gardener he likes flowers I've been in
33:45
the upper room I spoke on the Sea of
33:47
Galilee I was in Shiloh where Joshua led
33:50
the people into the Promised Land that's
33:53
where they first settled I was there I
33:54
saw every spiritual spirit round the
33:58
thing that had been opened by all these
34:01
mighty men and women of God and I think
34:03
the thing that moved me the most was you
34:05
could hold a Bible and stand not quite
34:09
but it seemed I can see from one end
34:10
Israel to the other it's not very big
34:12
but everything in the Bible happened in
34:16
that small area and they have kept those
34:21
places they've kept them and they like
34:26
Americans
34:27
but Israel loves Trump
34:31
they love him because in the short
34:33
amount of time what he was able to do
34:35
for that country that's never been done
34:36
before it was actually promised by many
34:39
presidents in our country but they never
34:41
did it he did it and they all loved him
34:46
it doesn't matter how old they are
34:47
doesn't matter if they're Orthodox or
34:49
you know messianic or secular Jews it
34:53
doesn't matter they all love him because
34:56
he's made their country safer he's
34:58
finally announced it is literally a real
35:02
country amen it had the right to that
35:05
land they got the Golan Heights back
35:07
you've got to go everywhere in this
35:08
country because Americans are welcome by
35:10
anybody a general matter if it's
35:12
Palestinians it doesn't matter who it is
35:14
Syrians if they live in that country
35:16
they kind of separate up the land is
35:18
real smart they don't have as much war
35:21
because they sat down and talked to
35:22
these people well they own all the land
35:25
the Palestinians aren't but they made an
35:27
agreement we'll let you live there but
35:28
you'll pay taxes instead of having
35:31
awards that will keep fighting what we
35:32
all live our lives so they don't go in
35:35
their area without permission but
35:38
everybody gets along and so all these
35:40
different sections I think is like ABC
35:42
cently they came up with a plan I was
35:44
amazed at the plan but but the American
35:46
tourists can go to any part of Israel
35:48
they want to because those people know
35:50
they're gonna make money so they welcome
35:54
tourists all the time it's like they
35:56
won't let an Israeli bus driver go into
35:58
one area but they'll let a bus driver
36:01
from that area pick up the Americans and
36:03
bring them in that area and so that's
36:06
why there's not as much war also the
36:09
threat that Trump said if you attack
36:10
them you're attacking me in my country I
36:13
think that helps a little bit God
36:17
purpose for them to be friends and this
36:20
is a season of destiny for Israel it's a
36:23
season of destiny for Korea for England
36:26
amen of course for America and Hollywood
36:32
for priority things got his pinpointed
36:35
to start something between
36:38
2018 and then the 2019 major things
36:41
would happen in each one of those places
36:42
it was set
36:43
of course for their destiny and God made
36:47
sure I got to go to each one of those
36:48
places and declare something for him and
36:51
Korea was the first one at the end of
36:54
the right at the end of the games I was
36:56
invited to speak to a university isn't
36:58
that amazing
37:00
with my twelfth grade education see my
37:04
graduation certificate they wanted me to
37:08
come teaching about heaven and give
37:10
college credits for it and they all did
37:17
very well that was quite interesting I
37:22
lost 12 pounds because I don't like fish
37:28
guess what they ate every day of their
37:30
life
37:31
I had pretzels Brazil nuts and oranges
37:37
that's what I ate for 12 days and in
37:40
Israel it was almost the same I didn't
37:43
like their food either guess what they
37:46
eat a lot of fish the whole hotel
37:52
smelled like fish so I ate like tomatoes
37:59
a roll I again had some kind of nuts I
38:03
think it was almonds or something I ate
38:05
almonds and every now and then I have
38:07
some little dessert thing that was about
38:09
it so I lost 12 pounds there also if you
38:14
go to Israel make sure you're in pretty
38:16
good shape because you will climb up
38:19
everything steps made out of stone steps
38:24
that go forever
38:25
and then you're gonna come back down
38:27
there's no trolley car to take down okay
38:29
you walk up these steps down these steps
38:32
up these mountains down these mountains
38:34
sometimes inside the mountains but you
38:37
walk you're gonna walk those people walk
38:40
no wonder they're all in good shape
38:41
don't ride a camel
38:52
don't walk by mine either
38:56
my heart went out to the wise men as
39:00
they crossed the desert for to hurt each
39:05
with a bunch of camels it wasn't three
39:07
camels with three why's my whole life I
39:12
thought while they had a long journey
39:13
together there must have got each other
39:14
know each other really well right it's
39:16
just a three of them no they each had
39:19
lines of camels and they carried their
39:23
tents their food their food for the
39:25
camels their water their servants their
39:27
homes they carried everything with the
39:30
smelly camels and thinking I have a
39:35
whole new view of being on that camera
39:39
so some of it was funny most of it was
39:42
very powerful as I got to meet some
39:44
really amazing Jewish people they took
39:48
us into the Jewish quarter we had a
39:50
really great tour guide his name is
39:53
Yoshi if you ever plan to go there look
39:55
him up they call him the unofficial
39:57
mayor of tourism he also he's in his 70s
40:01
he's been I forgot three different digs
40:04
actually where the unearthed stuff and
40:06
everything he knows a lot about that
40:07
takes you into the old Roman places
40:09
before Christ was even born
40:11
and you see a lot learn a lot but the
40:14
thing that you never get over is the
40:16
presence of God there and you're so
40:19
impacted by you realize how they live
40:21
their lives and yet they have survived
40:24
survived survived and they have outlived
40:26
all of their enemies which they are very
40:30
pleased with and they'll always make the
40:32
statement no matter what went on they're
40:35
gone and we are still here so God does
40:41
have amazing plans he really does have
40:44
priority list he's working on and he's
40:46
going to complete his priority list it's
40:48
important to pray always pray never stop
40:51
praying
40:52
make sure you declare and decree also it
40:54
is a high level of praying
40:57
and when we pray many times we're asking
41:00
which is good because you don't have it
41:02
right if you don't ask you have not
41:04
because you ask not asking comes in a
41:08
form of the prayer reviews to be been
41:10
doing on most of our lives declaring and
41:12
occurring is another level of Prayer
41:14
where you have so much faith in you you
41:17
know what you say is going to happen
41:18
because you know the word what the word
41:21
says and your faith grows as you step
41:23
out and believe and trust God more and
41:25
do things you you become soulful of God
41:28
and you understand the word come so
41:31
alive to you because you're living it
41:33
you're not just reading you're living it
41:35
and so God does have a timeline in
41:39
heaven I was shown that timeline up into
41:42
heaven so many times I lost count I
41:44
stopped counting but I remember every
41:47
time I've been he has a timeline behind
41:49
his throne and I've seen part of that
41:52
timeline and there's still a lot left
41:53
that hasn't happened and every one of
41:56
those things I saw was not like a date
41:58
it wasn't like March 2nd 2019 it was the
42:03
name of the event that was going to take
42:04
place and there's still things we
42:07
haven't done that the word talks about
42:09
so I know there are people literally
42:11
writing books and sharing from their
42:13
platform it's called all gonna end well
42:16
they've been saying that a long time the
42:18
Mayans lost out they had their last
42:19
chance they're all dead and gone and
42:20
we're still here so the Mayans timeline
42:24
that's gone that was actually written
42:26
down and people said well we don't have
42:27
much time left I want I'll still be here
42:30
and it'll all be gone I'm not going
42:32
anywhere yeah and so God has his
42:34
timeline and there are events we're
42:37
living in one of those events right now
42:39
that he calls the kingdom age and in
42:42
this timeframe of this kingdom age which
42:45
is several generations of time it is it
42:49
is going to not end into the Millennial
42:52
age starts amen
42:55
or right before the Millennial age
42:57
possibly I don't know when that's going
43:00
to end or happen either I just know it's
43:01
not for right now the perros times are
43:04
not for right now this is the day of his
43:09
power
43:09
or not the day of his wrath the most
43:12
important thing you can learn about God
43:14
is what time is it that's why the tribe
43:19
of Judah wouldn't do anything without
43:20
consulting the tribe of Issachar who
43:23
knew the times and seasons of God how to
43:25
operate in it what you needed to operate
43:28
in it what you needed to do to be
43:30
successful in it and the manifested sons
43:33
and daughters will operate just like the
43:34
tribe of Issachar in this time they will
43:37
know what time it is on God's timeline
43:38
and how to live the way you need to to
43:42
be successful so living on earth as it
43:45
doesn't happen is very important to know
43:46
that and to actually live it to believe
43:48
in God let your faith explode in him
43:51
be prepared to celebrate not to escape
43:55
forget escaping I love it
43:59
I love it the father says you've gone
44:01
too far
44:02
you can't go back it's too late to
44:05
escape being great that's what he thinks
44:10
about this time it's a time to be great
44:13
for him great with him amen
44:17
even you don't understand anything I'm
44:19
saying trust me it's not over how about
44:21
that one so roll of your rapture rug
44:26
don't worry about escaping because the
44:29
rapture won't be an escape it will be a
44:32
celebration so even that's not going to
44:37
be what most people think we have to
44:38
escape we have to we have to escape the
44:40
mark of the beast I don't think he's on
44:42
the earth yet you know why he won't be
44:47
able to do much because in this time we
44:49
get stronger and greater with God we
44:52
manifest the power of the Living God and
44:54
do you think so shocking that it will
44:56
stun he'll push darkness back and shift
44:59
this world and change things the
45:02
enterprise couldn't be here it says
45:06
clear in the world until he that is
45:08
withheld is removed the Antichrist
45:11
cannot appear and we're just finding out
45:14
who we are so forget about the rest of
45:17
stuff that is in the father's hands
45:20
jesus said to occupy until he comes back
45:23
not high we also get to put the third
45:29
show on God put the first one on kicking
45:35
Satan out of heaven with all of his
45:37
fallen angels who were angry and bitter
45:39
at their newfound leader who lied to
45:42
them the first thing he said to him was
45:44
a lie everything after that has been a
45:46
lie
45:47
he even lied them when Christ's went
45:49
into hell remember because he had to he
45:51
was telling he's gonna wipe up hell with
45:52
him get ready we're gonna have a show
45:56
oh I'm putting on the biggest show he
46:00
said well wipe him up and people are
46:02
gonna know fine you once and for all I
46:04
have more power I have more authority
46:05
this is my heir my area my realm my role
46:08
here and no one's going to come in here
46:10
and tell me what to do and yet he beat
46:12
him up how many people saw the Avengers
46:14
and saw the Hulk take Loki Beibei Bam
46:19
Bam Bam Bam Bam pretty much that's
46:23
what's gonna happen in the movie I love
46:30
what Jeff says Iron Man shows up first
46:32
in Jesus this is not this is a this is a
46:36
fictional account okay taking some
46:39
license in this because Jesus did melt
46:44
the faces of the principalities they
46:47
melted like laughs so there's an Iron
46:49
Man to the leader of all these that he
46:56
had taken so much time to call in
46:59
because principalities don't sit in hell
47:02
if you understood how hell operated you
47:05
would understand how much that scripture
47:07
what that means in that scripture when
47:10
it says the principalities and powers he
47:13
wasted them and spoiled them well they
47:14
wouldn't even be in Hell normally they
47:17
rule on Thrones around this world
47:20
because Satan was gonna have a big show
47:22
he called them all in all that word went
47:24
everywhere call him in call him in I
47:25
want him to watch put him on the front
47:28
row at the gates of Hell right inside
47:31
the court yard they're gonna see me man
47:33
all stoked I'm a book at my royal robes
47:36
on no he's no shine his stones that at
47:40
that time he still had I got a shine on
47:42
so they you know they glow
47:44
let me fell because of his duty he's
47:47
about to lose it all he had the keys I'm
47:51
in charge of death this was him he
47:54
actually said these words he bragged
47:56
about it on purpose so here comes all
47:59
the hierarchy all the little demons have
48:01
to be way in the back screaming and
48:02
complaining whining why they'd be guys
48:05
coming here they all hate each other by
48:07
the way there's no love and Satan's care
48:10
so he's gonna have a good show and all
48:12
this time Christ is saying nothing just
48:15
waiting for his father to say something
48:17
or hear something third day lightning
48:21
bolt hits hell Brett when the show is
48:23
gonna start you know in order to have a
48:26
show you have to have lights you got to
48:29
have action you have drama you have a
48:33
lot of noise and somebody recording it
48:39
all oh don't forget the audience got to
48:45
have the audience so Satan had all
48:48
planned out from his master table or he
48:51
had planned all this out right figured
48:54
God didn't come the first day God wasn't
48:56
didn't know where he was he went smart
48:57
enough didn't come the second day he was
48:59
afraid he wasn't strong enough so now
49:01
we're moving him from the back of Hell
49:02
up here we're gonna plan a show that did
49:06
not happen
49:07
not the way they planned so when that
49:11
happened there was a little shudder in
49:13
hell they remember the lightning bolt
49:15
that's what took him out of heaven that
49:19
was the father's only thing he had to do
49:22
with the whole show it was his sons
49:24
stands up and the fire of God comes out
49:27
of his hands it begins to melt one by
49:29
one the little guys in the back row were
49:31
really GAD they weren't they were glad
49:32
they weren't on the front row there's a
49:35
big opening towards the back of Hell
49:37
from the courtyard they were trying to
49:39
cram themselves they were running so
49:42
fast screaming trying to get away from
49:45
the Son of God melt
49:47
everything literally running down this
49:50
this darkened tunnel they were screaming
49:52
and jumping running on top of each other
49:55
they didn't care the principalities were
49:57
getting the front row and then he melts
50:01
half the faces of all them some of them
50:03
managed to get away when I was a little
50:05
girl I would see them when I went into
50:07
my places I see these demons their heads
50:10
were like this big there was this thick
50:12
their eye sockets were melted their
50:15
mouths were disfigured and melted and I
50:17
was standing there and go I wonder what
50:19
happened to them what what happened to
50:23
them I don't think hell can melt their
50:26
own demons I mean I didn't really know
50:28
until I was taken back in time and I was
50:31
shown it now I understand completely I
50:36
don't know why you're chiming this God
50:38
but I'm enjoying every moment of it
50:42
until I got the call from the producer
50:44
saying I'm gonna make a resurrection
50:46
movie want me to give me spiritual
50:47
content and trust me they want it in the
50:56
movie he is not afraid of what any man's
51:02
gonna say he's waiting 15 years to do
51:05
this film and he doesn't care he's a
51:07
businessman okay it says easier to work
51:11
with business people than religious
51:13
people because if it doesn't line up
51:14
with everybody's doctrine they don't
51:17
want it and they'll crucify you if you
51:20
put it in there and they said no don't
51:22
put it in there he's ignoring every one
51:23
of them I've waited 15 years to do this
51:26
movie I'm doing it God's way I want my
51:28
god wants and I don't care what anybody
51:29
says amen so I'm very excited about this
51:36
whole thing because the world will
51:38
finally know Jesus Christ is the son of
51:40
God not good
51:50
so God informed me several years ago
51:52
that I'm gonna put a third show on but I
51:55
won't be doing it you will it's for the
52:00
sons and daughters that's why the earth
52:02
cries out for them to stand up and do
52:05
something he said I did the first show
52:10
my son the second show you all get to do
52:12
the third one lights action drama lots
52:16
of yelling raising the dead that were
52:20
cremated I'm serious but if you go to a
52:26
funeral and he says get up there and
52:28
take the lid off that John you command
52:29
that spirit to come back in that body
52:30
are you going to do it you should say
52:34
that very loudly because trust me if he
52:38
says that to you you are gonna know it
52:41
is the Son of God you're not in your
52:44
head gonna even have there's no time to
52:45
even argue with that when he says
52:47
something you get so empowered you're
52:49
like sure take the lid off the jar I
52:53
command your spirit to come back into
52:55
that body in Jesus name and all the
52:57
ashes come out like a whirlwind and
52:59
there's the person
53:05
that is part of the third show-stopping
53:09
earthquakes and then telling them put it
53:12
back the way it was before they happen
53:15
we are over the earth we are over the
53:19
ocean we over all of the atmosphere over
53:23
every creature on this earth we have a
53:27
Thornton dominion over them we're just
53:30
finally going to demonstrate it so don't
53:35
ask me where's that in the word I just
53:37
told you it's Genesis 1:26 and in Romans
53:44
what talks about the manifested sons or
53:46
daughters that is you don't wait for
53:52
some great name person to come stand
53:54
somewhere and do it cuz stuffs gonna
53:57
happen everywhere and who's gonna do
53:58
something about it we are with Jesus
54:01
Christ
54:04
don't think I'm too old you don't care
54:07
for ninety nine or nine if he picked you
54:11
he picked you and you sit in your seats
54:14
all you want to say I don't want to do
54:15
that it won't work
54:18
he has this wonderful powerful way about
54:21
himself to influence you and convince
54:25
you especially if he comes in person
54:29
you're gonna go and you're gonna think
54:33
you're gonna melt into the ground when
54:36
those eyes
54:37
that blaze with passion for you look in
54:40
you and say but I need you to do this
54:44
you're gonna run over top of everybody
54:46
you know you're not gonna care what one
54:48
person says you're not gonna be very
54:50
quiet by the way practice yelling people
54:59
go on quiet you won't be quiet on that
55:01
day I was a person who never spoke I was
55:07
happy never speaking to anybody I think
55:09
I spoke to two kids people in high
55:11
school I wasn't trying to be a part of
55:14
anything
55:15
care at a tribe they spoke all the time
55:18
I didn't need to hear someone else
55:19
talking I was the person who never of us
55:23
the wallflower the one who never wanted
55:25
to say anything I didn't want to hug
55:26
people I had enough people hugging me at
55:28
home I didn't want to hug people I cared
55:31
about him you know god help him I did
55:36
help them my dad did so I helped my help
55:39
my dad helped people but still I was a
55:41
person who never wanted to be known I
55:43
would have never had pink hair on my
55:46
head I like my long blonde hair I didn't
55:51
ask for pink hair Jesus Christ came in
55:56
person sat on my loveseat at 4 a.m. put
56:02
his arm around me so I thought my body
56:03
was gonna melt into his it began to tell
56:06
me what my destiny was this is after
56:09
they've been taking me to heaven since
56:10
1996 now he tells me the other side of
56:13
the story and then he hooks him he goes
56:16
and we need you to have pink highlights
56:18
in your hair I didn't dare voice
56:24
anything who was gonna tell the Lord of
56:25
glory I don't want to do that and then
56:30
in my head I'm thinking why you know why
56:33
my daughter's gonna get married in two
56:35
months the in-laws already think I'm
56:38
strange
56:41
all over takers walk down the aisle with
56:43
pink he knows every thought you're
56:50
thinking and he looks at me and pleases
56:54
are on your toes because it is
56:57
absolutely necessary that when the world
57:00
sees you and they hear you and they know
57:03
you know us but you love and you have
57:08
pink hair you're never going to judge
57:09
them they'll listen to anything you say
57:12
we need that pink hair is heaven's
57:14
marketing plan I'm sure there's not a
57:19
pastor on this earth that ever thought
57:21
God would use pink hair as a marketing
57:22
plan I've met some of them for four
57:29
years I served so many pastors of
57:31
different events in my city love them
57:34
they knew me so well but I had gone over
57:37
the deep end when I had pink hair put on
57:38
my head
57:39
I want y'all y'all need to get more of
57:44
the Spirit in you because you could too
57:47
son you know know me by the spirit not
57:50
the not the flesh right it's a flesh
57:53
test and just get ready for you ask you
57:56
to have green hair I wouldn't encourage
57:59
you to go get it because he has a
58:02
purpose for it and I've been trying to
58:04
explain ever since I've had this since
58:05
2006 I've had pink hair I've won more
58:09
people to Lord then I had my entire life
58:11
before that it works just stand
58:14
somewhere if you're over fifty someone's
58:16
gonna come and ask you what is that well
58:21
on Heaven's ambassadora they have hair
58:23
like this in heaven and then I start
58:26
talking about the things they like cuz
58:28
Jesus is telling me the Holy Spirit is
58:29
telling me the whole time I'm stinging
58:30
in front of them talk about the talk
58:32
about the extreme sports in heaven I was
58:35
talking to two teenage girls on the
58:36
beach I think Jen was there
58:40
yeah they had skateboards with them but
58:44
you know a skateboard a skateboard right
58:46
so I start talking about extreme sports
58:48
in heaven where you don't even need a
58:49
helmet you do 100-foot jumps
58:53
and your skateboards got fire coming out
58:55
of it
58:57
and they drop their skateboards dock 14
59:01
what are you talking about I was told
59:06
there wasn't a god
59:07
oh no I've met him I been to his home
59:11
called heaven and you would not believe
59:13
the things I have there and did you know
59:16
he made you and did you know you lived
59:19
in him before you came here they don't
59:22
care about any doctrine they've only
59:24
heard God hates them because they're
59:26
sinners they've only been told about
59:29
Hell not God so I talked to them for 40
59:33
minutes they're so filled so excited
59:35
about God do you want to know where they
59:36
could go they went to give yourself to
59:39
him they want to know where can I go
59:40
that I can hear this stuff I said well I
59:41
don't know how many places are here yet
59:43
but the church I go to they do teach
59:46
about heaven that there is a heaven did
59:48
you teach you how to live your life set
59:50
your blessing him helping people that's
59:52
the way you talk to people you're not
59:56
you're not accusing them of anything I
59:58
talk to them like they know him and
60:00
that's what God said talk to them like
60:03
they already know us then they're
60:05
interested so in this time learn how to
60:09
talk to people and you know what the
60:12
angel standing around you they're gonna
60:14
help keep you protect you especially if
60:16
you command an army from heaven that
60:19
might be new to you too don't be afraid
60:21
by that we are over the Angels is that
60:26
true everybody
60:27
are we gonna judge them and they succumb
60:30
well you can't judge somebody that
60:32
you're under you need to start thinking
60:37
about what the Bible says about you make
60:38
a list stand in front of a mirror and
60:40
say it every day I did that I did it all
60:46
the time and one day Jesus walked in my
60:48
wall and the wall of my home and he
60:50
keeps walking in there all the time it's
60:53
not impossible for you to go to heaven
60:55
and see heaven it's quite wonderful but
61:01
I'm not ready to go over there I know
61:04
people go the cry when they have to
61:05
leave I don't cry because I'm not gonna
61:08
leave here without fulfilling everything
61:11
he wants me to do and that is to help
61:14
campaign for this coming election
61:17
I'll have I have a new studio I'm gonna
61:20
have a broadcast at least once a week
61:22
jump on the Trump 2020 train give
61:26
reports from heaven the whole time but
61:28
God is saying and then you see things
61:30
happen through the whole election God
61:34
has a plan for this country to make it a
61:38
pattern for other countries leaders to
61:40
one after we just have to love those
61:43
that don't understand or don't like it
61:45
but their lives even their lives are
61:48
better than they were before even they
61:52
are benefiting I know people who blasted
61:55
and yelled and hollered and yet they're
61:56
small businessmen they get 25% reduction
61:58
on their taxes and they don't say no
62:03
they're gonna vote for him this time
62:05
because something actually happened
62:08
during someone's term that did something
62:12
to help them amen everybody stand up
62:16
we're gonna declare something you don't
62:19
have to but you can and then we're gonna
62:22
have some Q&A time it's hard if I have a
62:28
Q&A if I start with cueing any time I
62:30
never want to stop it's hard to stop so
62:33
I can stop what I'm talking about so we
62:35
can have some because people have
62:37
questions and it's my London or my
62:40
favorite things to do
62:41
is to answer people's questions if I
62:43
know I'll answer if I don't I just say I
62:45
don't know amen so we're going to clear
62:48
something say father I am your child I
62:52
want your will your way in my life and
62:58
for this earth so I declare the upcoming
63:04
election in 2020 the one you have chosen
63:09
will win in a landslide you will show
63:14
your favor over that administration and
63:18
give them new things to do to help our
63:23
country be greater than it ever was
63:26
before
63:27
and God because I care I pray for the
63:31
other side the blinders we've taken off
63:35
the rise they will stop hating they will
63:39
start loving that they will benefit from
63:43
this whole thing because this is your
63:46
plan and we want your man so help the
63:51
others God because we're running our
63:54
race your will your way hallelujah
64:01
[Applause]
64:06
we need to shout on that everybody
64:15
[Applause]
64:23
we're we need more in the body of Christ
64:27
like cat that lays it down I mean 24
64:33
years because she's heard God and she's
64:36
not ashamed to proclaim what God has
64:38
told her regardless of the persecution
64:41
she takes and I know she doesn't say but
64:43
it's got to be something else on
64:46
Facebook and different things and quotes
64:48
and things that people say and she is
64:51
dedicated committed to her God and so as
64:55
we go into the question and answers we
64:57
want to take an offering for her and
64:59
pass offering the offering baskets for
65:02
her while we're doing this because this
65:04
is a fun time so go ahead and have a
65:06
seat and pastor Brooke if you and Renato
65:10
could take these mics so that we can get
65:13
every question on it so our streamers
65:16
can hear the questions oh she's awesome
65:18
so she doesn't have to repeat it up here
65:21
and father we just thank you once again

65:52
nights
65:53
we've been empowered with a new boldness
65:56
if that's possible I don't know what
65:59
we're gonna be like but father God we
66:03
are going into an upgrade we are all
66:05
upgrading so Lord we want a blessed camp
66:08

66:11

66:14
earth and Lord she doesn't even need
66:17
this money because she's got you we need
66:21

67:03
this is what we're gonna do
67:05
this is the order we're gonna do on this
67:07
side on this side and on this side we're
67:09
gonna rotate back and forth we're not oh
67:10
you'll be on this side pastor Brooke on
67:12
this side and what you do you'll take
67:14
your questions we'll have the questions
67:15
come up on this side or this side and
67:18
ask the questions here so we can have
67:19
the mics so then it'll be clear for the
67:21
cameras too so awesome and so you can
67:26
give online at WWE or on your mobile
67:31
phone text go mz2 seven seven nine seven
67:34
seven and you'll seek a career there or
67:37
you can give cash or check now the
67:43
questions I want to say just a couple of
67:45
words about the questions some people
67:47
think they don't have one until they
67:48
hear the first one the answer and then
67:51
everybody has questions and I'm a detail
67:54
person that's why God picked me
67:55
so most questions have a lot of detail
67:58
to them so and you're gonna love every
68:01
one of them it doesn't matter you're
68:02
going to learn from this Q&A session but
68:05
try to keep it to questions about heaven
68:07
itself about the spirit realm activities
68:11
or about the time we're living in right
68:13
now because some people go into it's not
68:17
it's easy to answer a personal question
68:19
about yourself because most of the stuff
68:22
he gives me is for the corporate body of
68:24
Christ so it should be something that
68:26
everyone here would be interested in I
68:29
wanted to know the answer to it makes it
68:31
much easier for me because if I answered
68:33
everybody's personal question we would
68:36
literally be here all night long so try
68:38
to keep it to something and just one
68:40
question okay somebody showed up one
68:42
time they had 115 questions on the lid
68:45
I heard from a prophet a long time ago
68:50
that you are a wise person if a prophet
68:53
is coming and you want a question you
68:55
write it down and hand it to that
68:58
prophet put your phone number on it or
69:00
your email and eventually you'll hear
69:03
something back but if you come
69:05
unprepared then you're gonna go over
69:07
with whatever God gave them to share
69:09
when you missed your chance to ask
69:12
something that you want to know so
69:13
always come prepared okay and any of the
69:16
questions if you don't get to come up
69:19
here and speak in them write it on a
69:21
piece of paper and leave it at the
69:24
products table with your first name and
69:26
your age and where you're from because I
69:29
am literally looking for a lot of new
69:33
questions for book three and we're gonna
69:35
change out all the ones that are on our
69:37
website so we're always looking for new
69:39
questions so it's not going to be lost
69:40
okay so let's just get the first
69:44
question when the father asks us to
69:48
resurrect the ashes can it be a person
69:55
this would be somebody who just recently
69:58
died yeah you're not learning upbringing
70:02
they're not coming anyway somebody been
70:06
dead it's been 10 years you think
70:08
they're gonna leave heaven look I know
70:11
you've walked on truly Europe they're a
70:14
part of your lives but if you could go
70:17
there and see how they were living you
70:19
wouldn't ask them to come back just be
70:21
prepared when you go and you know what's
70:24
gonna happen to get there then no wonder
70:26
they didn't want to come back down here
70:28
in their old bodies so it would normally
70:32
this would be somebody who just died
70:34
like at a funeral and you were at the
70:36
funeral something like that unless one
70:38
thing so this is help this is what
70:40
happens I was shown in the future and
70:42
the entire plane crashes everybody's
70:44
burn up in the plane like to ashes and a
70:47
believer goes in resurrects everybody up
70:49
that burned up in the plane they all
70:51
come back to life they get their bodies
70:53
back they even have their clothes on
70:54
that is something that will be that will
70:56
happen that's like a greater work or
70:58
Manifest asunder so that could be
71:01
something like that but it's usually
71:02
something that just happened okay so I
71:08
know that the Lord promotes us on earth
71:10
as we're faithful right so are we going
71:13
to be continued to be promoted when
71:15
we're in heaven into eternity well God I
71:20
think everybody heard that question I
71:22
kind of say it a god promotes us on the
71:24
earth and it says that he's the one who
71:26
lifts up and puts down we know he does
71:28
that and sometimes even unexpected
71:30
people unknown people he does that and
71:32
he's certainly gonna do that a lot like
71:34
over the next 20-30 years you're gonna
71:35
see that happen a lot down here God has
71:38
his ways to reward you when you get to
71:40
heaven and you cannot say no to that
71:43
reward that reward you'll never forget
71:45
for the rest of your existence and that
71:48
is the main way God rewards you in
71:50
heaven for all you've done on the earth
71:52
for him even things you didn't even
71:54
think he was aware of but he doesn't
71:56
stop rewarding you so it's not so much
72:00
like you have to be promoted in heaven
72:02
you're already promoted because you move
72:05
there the gift he put in you people will
72:07
run to see you use that gift so you in a
72:10
way your whole life changes whatever
72:12
your passion is he putting you to do
72:14
with your natural gift he prepares
72:16
everything in heaven for you to use that
72:18
gift so a lot of people going to come
72:20
they're going to celebrate who you are
72:22
they're gonna love it so that way is a
72:24
non-stop promoting of you because of the
72:27
way he designed heaven so you're gonna
72:29
love it you're gonna just love it Kat
72:33
has the Lord shown you much about the
72:35
destiny of New York and Connecticut I'd
72:38
like to know better how to pray and I am
72:40
from those areas originally I do know
72:42
that New York is going to become a
72:43
region of light in this country yes
72:47
because of and he even explained vine
72:49
because they were willing to open their
72:52
borders to bring all the unwanted the
72:55
ones coming to find rescue New York was
72:58
very unique for God's purpose for it and
73:00
they fulfilled that purpose that many
73:02
purpose he had was for them to welcome
73:04
them in people came from all over the
73:06
world set up their own settlements and
73:08
then because some of them became very
73:10
great people
73:11
they went to other places but New York
73:12
was like a birthing place for people for
73:15
their destinies for their gifts and God
73:17
is planning to honor that it will become
73:19
a region of light where one point
73:21
there'll be no crime no sin and no
73:23
sickness and I was I was born in New
73:28
York so I also know that I left heaven
73:31
and was sent to New York New York Yankee
73:40
sent all the way to the deep south I
73:44
promised to tell people that okay if you
73:46
come to floor don't worry about being
73:47
carried off by an alligator you probably
73:49
will never even see an alligator they
73:51
don't roam they're not like the Buffalo
73:54
they have to stay in the water or their
73:58
hide will fall off the only time you see
74:02
an amount of the water is crossing the
74:04
road to go to another body of water
74:06
their height is about this thick and the
74:09
dinosaurs even we see how these
74:11
questions go the dinosaurs on the earth
74:13
when it was made the first time they
74:15
could not have survived on the earth
74:17
like it is now because those dinosaurs
74:19
had to stay in continual mist and water
74:22
so the atmosphere was like a continual
74:25
mist the sky was a peachy pink the Sun
74:28
wasn't there he lit the original earth
74:30
with his glory and they did wrong with
74:32
watch her angels that's why they find
74:34
footprints it's not a human footprint
74:36
it's a watcher angel they hadn't flesh
74:38
on them there is a history lesson go
74:41
ahead what's the next question first of
74:44
all I want to say thank you for being
74:46
the gift and the wrap the Revelator day
74:49
you are so we love you and the other one
74:52
is without giving too much away when you
74:54
us to expect your next book and King
74:58
without giving all of it away what to
75:01
expect in the next book I am working on
75:04
the next book but God has a timeline for
75:06
that and he says the movie has to come
75:08
first because it'll take one-third of my
75:11
life every year to work in the movie in
75:14
Hollywood on the movie and I have to be
75:17
honest I have to be then when they do
75:19
anything because of the spirit realm
75:20
they've never seen it so even though we
75:22
give them sketches and drawings they're
75:24
not
75:24
quite sure the activity or the words
75:27
that were spoken at that time what does
75:28
the atmosphere feel like so they have
75:30
creators who are going to work on all
75:32
the spirit realm stuff I have to be
75:34
present when that's done as you present
75:36
when they actually create the sets I
75:38
have to be present when they do the
75:39
filming and so I'll probably get the
75:41
weekends off and that's going to take 18
75:43
months just when they get to that part
75:45
so I'll be working on an off on book 3
75:48
it will be 3 times bigger then it'll be
75:51
the last one called revealing heaven
75:53
number 3 so he started a relationship
75:56
with you in heaven in book 1 and book
75:59
two increases in every level it shows
76:01
you more of what's in heaven book 3 is
76:03
going to show things that will shock you
76:05
and stun you that's in heaven it'll
76:08
it'll have a picture of a human soul I
76:10
can tell you that literally how he made
76:12
your soul how it operates will be in the
76:15
book even the scene from the third day
76:17
in hell I can tell you that will be when
76:19
the illustrations I have 25
76:21
illustrations I'm working on I always do
76:23
those first and then he gives me the
76:25
chapter titles of what to write about
76:26
because I know so much about it it's
76:29
going to be stunning i opening and you
76:33
will celebrate a lot when you see the
76:35
things that are that are going to be in
76:36
that third book they'll even be prophecy
76:38
at the end about the future and even
76:41
some scenes from the future like one of
76:43
the planets that will be created when
76:45
the new earth is made so it's gonna be
76:51
pretty cool since we are part of the
76:54
putting on the third show like the X
76:59
power 'full first show and second show
77:01
can you tell us anything about that that
77:04
you might know
77:05
and one other thing anything about John
77:08
F Kennedy jr. um I have not seen John F
77:12
Kennedy jr. in heaven that doesn't mean
77:14
he's not there heaven is bigger than our
77:17
whole galaxy it's a plan it's a world
77:19
it's not a flat place and almost every
77:22
picture I've seen of heaven all they can
77:23
draw as the throne room they don't know
77:26
they know there's a throne room there so
77:27
you see a picture of the throne room
77:28
right and usually the father and the son
77:32
are on the back wall and there's like a
77:34
mass of millions of people I can tell
77:36
you
77:36
not like that the throne-room is in the
77:38
middle the throne is in the middle of
77:40
the throne room and there's four sets of
77:42
steps that go up there so everybody can
77:44
run up and see them whenever they want
77:45
to
77:46
so that part needs a little correction
77:48
because he's not on the back wall away
77:50
from everybody the throne room expands
77:52
because it's alive he can hold as many
77:55
people as he wants to I can just tell
77:57
you the third show would be one of the
77:58
greatest of all because it's what God
78:00
has purpose went from the time we lived
78:03
in him and he sent us and took our
78:06
little spirit man and knit it together
78:08
in her mother's womb with our flesh body
78:11
we can't make a spirit man people we
78:15
can't make anything that has made out of
78:17
spiritual content we just can't
78:19
that's God's only God can do that part
78:22
so there is no life until the spirit is
78:25
attached to that data flesh and we will
78:28
see so many powerful things some of the
78:29
things I've been talking about even
78:30
tonight will be part of that third show
78:33
but one of the things I don't talk a lot
78:35
about is the presence of the glory the
78:38
presence of the glory will be so
78:40
powerful most people don't know what the
78:42
glory is they know it's probably going
78:45
to be beautiful it's going to be amazing
78:46
it literally is like carrying the life
78:49
of God yourself and in operating at
78:53
sometimes without measure everyone has a
78:59
measure the work talks about us
79:01
operating in a measure god gives those
79:03
measures but some of the manifests the
79:04
sons of daughters who will be everyday
79:06
people will operate when they're
79:08
operating it'll be like without measure
79:10
the power be so tremendous that
79:13
sometimes it will impact an entire state
79:16
when something is demonstrated or done
79:18
sometimes it will impact an entire
79:20
country what will happen I know the Dead
79:23
will be raised in mass like thousands at
79:27
one time by one person and so these are
79:30
some of the things and this is part of
79:32
the third show it won't be one day it's
79:37
not going to be like you know in hell on
79:39
the third day that was a day and
79:42
heaven it wasn't just a de space-time
79:45
there's no time in heaven but it it
79:47
wasn't something he could do if there
79:49
was time you think about one third of
79:51
the Angels he kicked out along with
79:53
their leader that probably if there was
79:56
time would have been a while along
79:58
enough for them to have a big party
79:59
going on the whole time and pretty sure
80:01
that happened because they were all
80:04
happy he was kicked out they you think
80:06
about it heaven was holy it was pure it
80:10
was undefiled they all loved one another
80:12
they work together you know like
80:14
brothers did God made tribes of angels
80:17
for very specific purposes they all knew
80:20
their own purpose they were happy about
80:22
why he made them to do the Army was
80:24
there they had no enemy to fight there
80:28
was no enemy but God had made an army
80:31
for the specific person purpose of
80:34
fighting against the dark army there was
80:37
no dark army until Lucifer decided to
80:40
take over they knew who their enemies
80:43
would be from that point on and so I
80:46
just can tell you this that the show is
80:49
going to be tremendous it will be
80:50
ongoing probably for several generations
80:53
which will also shift the way all of our
80:56
lives will begin to operate for several
80:59
generations after that and I know people
81:01
have a timeline for the rapture nobody
81:04
knows that day except the father and
81:06
he's the one saying this stuff okay he
81:10
showed me the next fifty years of my
81:11
life that doesn't mean it's my last
81:13
assignment
81:14
I just know exactly what I'll be doing
81:16
for the next 50 years what platforms
81:18
I'll be operating for him and I'm
81:20
telling you I just started the fifty
81:22
year or so so I can guarantee you I know
81:26
it's even beyond that time and because
81:29
it doesn't end until God says it ends
81:32
amen and even that I think the probably
81:37
the last big show will be the marriage
81:38
supper of the Lamb I've also been shown
81:41
parts of that it's going to be beyond
81:43
anything you ever imagined it only gets
81:46
better with God you don't lose it's
81:49
worth anything to be a part of him and
81:53
what he wants
81:54
it's not worth anything to help hell
81:57
hell doesn't celebrate anybody they take
82:01
the worst people who sold their self
82:03
literally met the Satan so that really
82:05
does happen - and lies to them like he
82:08
did I mean he did that in heaven right
82:10
he did that on the earth even tried to
82:12
attempt Jesus to do that
82:13
he's never changes them all and so he
82:16
does get people to do all kinds of
82:17
horrific things and he promises them
82:19
with lies I'll give you power Authority
82:21
I'll give you part of my kingdom
82:23
you'll rule with me he tortures them
82:25
worse than anyone else and makes a show
82:28
of it himself in hell he hates them
82:31
worse than anybody they get nothing they
82:33
get worse done to him done to them than
82:36
anyone else who just rejected tries it's
82:39
only worse and bad for them okay so he
82:43
didn't love anyone don't help him don't
82:45
advertise for him it's about time we
82:47
start advertising about the glory God
82:49
and the goodness of the earth and the
82:51
good things that are happening all over
82:52
this earth because I don't think the
82:54
fake news understand that or they don't
82:57
know about it but there are powerful
82:59
things happening right now in this earth
83:00
that God is in charge of that are
83:02
happening about people loving one
83:04
another countries helping each other and
83:06
you never see that that's gonna change
83:09
okay next question I always imagined
83:14
heaven as being the sort of place where
83:16
everybody can fly around and have
83:18
SuperSpeed and stuff so like during the
83:21
kingdom age does that mean people will
83:22
be able to do that here I would say
83:25
since we're all saying on earth as it is
83:28
in heaven I have to see some of that
83:30
happening here and I'm sure at different
83:34
times if you need you - why wouldn't you
83:36
fly
83:40
I mean why wouldn't you he transported
83:45
Phillip through the sky on a chariot
83:49
he's not the only one he did that to
83:52
either so why not because yes to do fly
83:55
in heaven I was take a new place and
83:58
this is C this is what rocks people is
83:59
not the fact that tell me flying heaven
84:01
is who teaches you to do that in heaven
84:04
that the religious minded I get they
84:06
almost like gnash their teeth when I
84:08
tell them things like this because they
84:09
can't see in their head happening I was
84:21
taken to a place in heaven that was this
84:24
massive amusement park it's in my first
84:26
book it really exists I've been there
84:28
several times since then it has the
84:30
impossible impossible impossible things
84:33
happening that you have so much fun with
84:35
doing and this is the thing if somebody
84:39
receive Jesus Christ as their Savior as
84:41
they were dying they will be in heaven
84:46
and they will still use the gift God
84:49
sent them as so if you sent them doing
84:53
wonderful fun things they have movies in
84:56
heaven no defilement no profane language
84:58
no sexuality no graphic violence forget
85:01
it you could there's no ratings they
85:03
don't need them but heaven makes ratings
85:06
for our movies down here our is rotten
85:10
[Laughter]
85:13
pg13 partly good 13 % PG partly good G
85:19
mostly good so remember that when you go
85:23
to watch a movie Superman teaches you
85:30
how to fly huh Christopher Reeves
85:39
Christopher Reeves teaches you to fly
85:44
you think about the humor and all that
85:47
because they have a place where you
85:49
actually learn you don't just jump up
85:52
and do it there's things you have to
85:53
learn in heaven there's things just
85:55
given to you and you do it but he wants
85:57
you to discover things
85:58
I mean he's our Father like you want
86:00
your kids to discover things and then
86:02
you do them how wonderful does that make
86:04
you feel well it's no different in
86:06
heaven so they have a place in heaven
86:08
where you can go and they have stands
86:10
for all your friends and family to come
86:12
watch you learn to fly it doesn't work
86:17
out the first time
86:23
there's more laughter in heaven than
86:25
anything in this earth and people invite
86:28
their friends on purpose to learn
86:31
because they know they're gonna have a
86:33
mini show right there
86:35
so everybody's friends and family are
86:37
waiting because they've already learned
86:38
right they can just dream they have the
86:41
beginners area god smart you could hit
86:43
each other and weren't hurt but why
86:45
right so they have the beginners area
86:47
where you learn basic instructions on
86:49
flying then you have the intermediate
86:51
area then you have whatever you want to
86:53
go in heaven so this is the basic every
86:55
time where the beginners learn and most
86:58
of them get out there and they try to
87:00
fly this is one thing I've seen them
87:03
doing they're trying to fly across the
87:05
air that doesn't work sometimes they
87:06
look like they're rowing a boat I don't
87:08
know what they're doing and some of them
87:10
just throw their selves out there and
87:13
they spin spin spin spin spin spin spin
87:17
spin but your instructor will stop you
87:20
in eventually you learn no this is very
87:25
distance it's just like right just right
87:29
you better learn to laugh there's a lot
87:33
to laugh and sometimes it's you but yes
87:39
you will fly in heaven so why not down
87:43
here you never know what he's gonna do
87:46
with you I walked on there I didn't
87:49
expect that I've been talking about it I
87:52
stepped right off and just kept walking
87:54
and so I was just doing what was normal
87:58
and it became super naturally heaven
88:02
normal so what's the next question so I
88:05
have a lot of visions of the kingdom of
88:07
God and a lot of it's similar I'm
88:09
walking up step Jesus gives me the keys
88:11
and opened the door and I see a lot of
88:13
rooms I see a lot of items he wants me
88:16
to take does that actually change this
88:19
3d realm I mean what's the point in all
88:20
that we're talking about why you're on
88:23
the earth you're talking about why
88:24
you're in heaven if I see the kingdom of
88:26
God and I have a vision and the in Jesus
88:28
gives me something what's on point to
88:30
that there's a point to and I'm sure
88:33
he's got a point
88:34
I'd always know the point but it's the
88:36
same thing
88:37
that how he operates with me he'll show
88:39
me something and it might be years later
88:41
and then I do it that doesn't mean he's
88:43
not going to let you do it
88:45
because he has timing for everything he
88:48
has times he reveals things that's what
88:50
he's doing then there's times he
88:51
activates it was something you do or an
88:55
event that's gonna happen he will
88:56
activate it and then you will actually
88:58
do it and there will be there are places
89:01
built on this earth in spiritual areas
89:04
where because of what we're doing in who
89:07
we are in this time we will have access
89:09
to those places and do things and that's
89:12
probably what he was showing you that
89:14
was awesome I just want to thank you
89:20
first of all for supporting our great
89:22
president because the fake news lies
89:23
about him all the time and I thank you
89:25
for doing that and also I want to also
89:29
thank you that in 2009 my husband and I
89:32
lost our youngest son to an accident you
89:35
came here a few months later for your
89:37
first time here in 2010 mm-hmm and you
89:39
you actually said a portal opened up
89:41
above the ceiling here and you you
89:43
described him you saw him hanging by his
89:45
legs off the porch yeah I want to thank
89:47
you for that because what's his name
89:48
Luke yes it was
89:50
and the for him and the first time I
89:54
heard you speak before you said that I
89:56
was you know my flesh was like what is
89:58
she talking about I mean of course I
90:00
believed in heaven but we believe for
90:02
his bodily resurrection here and it
90:04
happened and I know you said just a
90:06
while ago that that would not happen
90:07
because he doesn't want to come back
90:09
you're not as much as he loves you this
90:12
is how they feel in heaven they don't
90:13
they don't feel like I stay have no
90:15
sorrow they have no grief there isn't
90:18
any in heaven they celebrate knowing one
90:20
day you're going to be there with them
90:22
and their whole focus is you being there
90:24
and to them it's not like 10 years have
90:27
gone by
90:28
they don't even think timewise like like
90:31
we would on the earth so all I can tell
90:33
you is he still feels the same way he's
90:34
still having an awesome time and he is
90:36
watching this meeting and my question
90:39
for you is as far as I know you spoke
90:41
about atheism last night you said that
90:43
all people have got in them he put that
90:47
in them
90:47
and my father is an atheist I've been
90:50
praying for him for 20 years and my
90:52
question is can I command the host of
90:54
heaven to go and save him because I just
90:56
spoke to him on Father's Day and
90:58
nothing's changed
90:59
don't go Bible and anything you're
91:01
hearing or seeing do not go by what the
91:03
evidence is in the natural you have to
91:06
believe what God's Word promises you
91:09
okay he promises you he says if you
91:11
believe in something say and you do not
91:13
doubt in your heart you shall have what
91:17
whatsoever you say so don't change what
91:21
you're saying don't change it okay
91:25
that's the best thing closure I can give
91:27
you okay this is the question I've been
91:31
wanting to ask you for a while in heaven
91:35
there's no sin and so this scripture has
91:39
kind of puzzled me where it says if you
91:43
don't forgive neither will you be
91:45
forgiven and so if you're a Christian
91:49
and there's somebody you hadn't forgiven
91:51
how does that work there's a big
91:54
difference in being angry and upset and
91:56
for unforgiveness consuming you
91:59
unforgiveness is like a spirit to
92:01
consumes you just being angry and upset
92:03
for somebody and you don't want to say
92:05
you know it's okay there's a big
92:08
difference
92:09
God is the only one who can judge that
92:11
he's not turning people away because
92:13
they had a reason to be angry or upset
92:15
and you don't want to speak to somebody
92:17
or if you think about him you it hurt
92:19
you inside it's more you losing stuff
92:22
from your soul loose all that all the
92:25
trauma whatever you experience from them
92:27
whatever they said you did you need to
92:29
lose that from your soul and the reason
92:32
for that is you won't think about it no
92:34
more because sometimes we're hurting
92:37
worse holding back from something then
92:40
the person who actually did something to
92:42
us and let me tell you if they make it
92:46
to heaven they will not remember that
92:49
people don't remember those things when
92:52
they get to heaven they love you no
92:53
matter who you are and they don't want
92:55
anyone suffering over something they
92:57
caused to happen on
92:58
or something someone on the earth did to
93:01
them because that is what Satan will do
93:03
he will take whatever caused you to feel
93:06
that way and he will ram it down you
93:08
everyday and he will make that that that
93:12
block longer and bigger he'll cause that
93:17
division between you to be stronger if
93:19
you let him do that so God says look at
93:22
what's happening to you and deal with
93:24
that first
93:25
because when that's dealt with you it
93:28
will become be very easy one day for you
93:30
to say I'm just gonna let it go and I'm
93:31
going to forgive them but the more you
93:33
dwell on it and meditate on those things
93:35
it will get stronger have a stronger
93:37
hold on you
93:38
so in God even said the the person who's
93:41
carrying that the person who's carrying
93:43
that in them it's because they're
93:44
suffering from something and yet the
93:47
person who caused it probably isn't even
93:48
thinking about anymore
93:49
or maybe they are maybe they're just
93:51
being hateful to you but their freedom
93:53
comes when your freedom comes so don't
93:58
let that be something that consumes your
94:00
Reks your life or your destiny because
94:02
that happened to you don't carry it you
94:04
loose it what you loose on earth they
94:06
will loose in heaven and you will get to
94:08
a place where it doesn't even affect you
94:10
then you can say this even though I
94:13
don't feel like this in my flesh I
94:15
choose as an act of my will to forgive
94:18
that person and that way your emotions
94:20
are not even involved okay I kept Hey I
94:33
just wanted to thank you first of all
94:34
for your first book I took a book to
94:38
Venezuela after my mother passed away
94:40
and everybody got set free from greevey
94:44
and yes and from depression they were so
94:49
sad after they read your book I told him
94:51
this is was true well my question
94:55
tonight is an originally from Venezuela
94:58
I've been here 40 years mm-hmm
95:00
has the Lord show you anything about the
95:03
evil government be in Venezuela removed
95:07
absolutely soon absolutely is shown he's
95:10
talked to me about Venezuela and
95:12
actually I was having the event in
95:13
Orlando and a woman came all the way
95:16
from Venezuela right when it started
95:19
brought me the Venezuelan flag and said
95:22
I'm giving you to this to take before
95:25
the course of heaven and before the
95:27
Father himself to bring a resolution for
95:29
our country so that it can be free to
95:31
the people who want to serve you there
95:33
will be free to serve you and God said I
95:35
will do it God said it only takes one
95:43
person sometimes to move his heart and
95:46
then this woman came for only that
95:49
reason all the way from that country
95:50
with that flag so God would be able to
95:53
do something because of her words and
95:55
what she declared and she was from there
95:58
he cannot reject or let her words drop
96:01
to the ground so you will see something
96:03
major happened in Venezuela what you say
96:06
that's what I've been doing I can't be
96:08
clear in the Venice oil I set free and I
96:11
tell my family there's be set free by
96:13
the Word of God the power of God amen I
96:16
[Applause]
96:22
would like to say one more thing about
96:25
the woman who talked about unforgiveness
96:29
especially especially if something
96:32
happened between you and a loved one I
96:34
started to start to talk about that than
96:37
I didn't and finish it no matter what
96:39
relationship you had here if that person
96:43
goes to heaven they will have more love
96:45
for you than they ever had down here on
96:48
this earth love you cannot even
96:50
understand in your mind right now you
96:53
cannot conceive of the love of God
96:55
living inside of somebody who has hope
96:58
for you who is declaring over you that's
97:01
asking God to bless you even if they
97:03
didn't treat you right when they were
97:04
here if they died suddenly and you were
97:07
not expecting it
97:08
they understand God understand sometimes
97:10
that can create a wound and you don't
97:12
let that won't be there that person is
97:15
having the time of their life they're
97:17
not just exist
97:18
ting they're living they live in his
97:21
love they're filled with his life and
97:23
the greatest thing they would ever want
97:25
for you is for you to complete your
97:27
destiny they may
97:30
their destiny may be finished in heaven
97:32
sometimes some people don't realize that
97:35
I've even seen young people who were
97:37
raised up here on this earth and when
97:40
they got to heaven they finished their
97:41
destiny so even young people don't miss
97:43
that and and you may heart have a hard
97:46
time understanding that but God still
97:48
has plans for children or for people and
97:51
they have a destiny their ultimate
97:54
destiny in heaven is to be that gift
97:56
whether it's to run a golf course or a
97:58
fishery or a carnival or a you know a
98:03
rodeo have a line of bakeries in heaven
98:07
whatever that gift was they never got to
98:08
use on the earth they will still use
98:10
that in heaven but the thing that I
98:12
noticed the most on there is how much
98:14
love people have I feel ways of it
98:16
coming from the people these are the
98:17
ones who've moved home to heaven and how
98:20
much they care about their family
98:21
members and they're declaring over every
98:24
member of their family not just one of
98:26
them
98:27
so something great happens on the inside
98:30
of them when they see him before the one
98:32
that they came from and the Lord has
98:36
courts him up the steps of the throne
98:37
and gives him literally back to the
98:39
Father they know they are home and they
98:43
know that's who sent them to that earth
98:46
men's I want encourage anybody if you've
98:49
lost somebody recently they're never
98:52
going to forget you they're not going to
98:54
replace you no one can ever replace you
98:56
on this earth but in case you wonder
98:59
it's okay to love again and that may not
99:01
be the right time to tell you but you
99:02
just need to know that one day that may
99:04
happen whoever's in heaven that loves
99:07
you is not going to be angry at you if
99:09
you have someone to love they're
99:11
probably asking God to send you someone
99:13
to love and this is the point when you
99:16
get home you're not married to anybody
99:19
that means you can still have them as
99:22
your best friend and so that you're
99:25
ready that relationship if you are
99:27
married on the earth you're a little bit
99:28
closer together as best friends
99:31
you know the people that weren't so it's
99:33
not like that relationship is gone
99:34
you're just not married for a reason and
99:37
this is the reason and it's a really
99:39
good reason the reason we go home and
99:41
we're not married when we get there we
99:43
come home is the father son or daughter
99:46
you live right next to the people that
99:48
you were married to you'll be best
99:50
friends but there's a legitimate reason
99:53
because we can only have one bridegroom
99:59
it would not be right and the Holy
100:02
Spirit gave me this revelation just a
100:04
couple weeks ago somebody was asking me
100:06
about that and I said well I think
100:07
there's probably a good reason why
100:08
you're not married and so I was told
100:11
this is why you were not married there's
100:13
going to be a marriage in heaven and
100:15
there can only be one bridegroom and
100:18
that bridegroom is for both male and
100:21
female we will be the Bride of Christ
100:24
you can't be married to someone else
100:26
it wouldn't be right that is that was
100:32
very revelatory so knowing people I say
100:34
ask me well how come on can't be married
100:36
I said because you already have a
100:37
marriage waiting on you in heaven and we
100:39
are all patrols to one person and his
100:43
name is Jesus Christ and no matter how
100:46
you feel about each other here when you
100:47
get there you will love him more than
100:50
anyone in existence so there's only one
100:55
bytecode and one bride and we're it so
101:01
maybe I don't know what time it is
101:03
probably have time to take a couple more
101:04
Oh who's next
101:07
okay other than being in the presence of
101:10
the Most High God and Jesus Christ what
101:14
was your most memorable and
101:16
transformational experience that you
101:18
took from heaven in heaven it is hard to
101:22
talk about that there's probably more
101:23
than one one was when I was caught up to
101:27
heaven I don't remember which what time
101:29
that was what what number that was I
101:31
gave up after about a thousand times I
101:33
stopped counting but I remember very
101:37
clearly every time I've gone but the one
101:40
impacted me the most because I'd seen
101:42
Jesus many times on the earth
101:44
doesn't mean I'm familiar with him I'm
101:46
still overwhelmed and undone but this
101:48
was with the father because I knew he
101:51
loved everybody people picture him super
101:52
glued to the throne they think he can
101:54
never leave it that's ridiculous okay he
101:57
goes all over heaven
101:58
he's year's time with everybody in
102:01
heaven but he has his own special place
102:04
he takes you to and it says it talks
102:09
about in the world where it says that
102:11
and all you're getting of knowledge get
102:13
understanding and it says that is
102:16
knowledge of the Holy One that's the
102:17
father so that's why he you hear me talk
102:21
so much about the father Jesus said I
102:23
want you to introduce the father to the
102:24
earth let them know about his love what
102:27
he thinks about them how they live
102:28
before they were here so they'll
102:30
understand and love him like they do me
102:32
because there's a lot about Jesus and
102:34
the board people had encounters with
102:36
Jesus everywhere not so much with the
102:38
father but in this time he wants us to
102:40
know him so he caught me up one time
102:42
when he catches me up I'm always eight
102:44
years old so that's why I remember
102:47
things it's real easy to remember that's
102:49
what he doesn't give me things he
102:51
doesn't use long words even when he
102:53
speaks to me up there he speaks to me
102:54
like I'm a real child
102:56
I have pigtails and I'm very excited
102:59
when I rob didn't want to run up and sit
103:01
on his lap so he can hold me because I
103:03
understand he is my my father he he's
103:08
our Father and I love this goodness Abba
103:11
Father you know or daddy however you
103:13
want to look at it when you get there
103:15
that's how you're gonna think about him
103:16
he caught me up one time but it wasn't
103:18
to the throne he took me by my hand and
103:21
this is the thing about God he can be a
103:23
150 foot tall if he wants to be he means
103:26
big as a source if he wants to be he's
103:29
big okay he can hold anyone in his arms
103:32
no matter how big you are here you're
103:34
not so big that he can't hold you in his
103:36
arms but he can also make himself
103:38
smaller so he can walk right next to you
103:40
so here my look grow pigtails I'm
103:43
looking up at him his hair is filled
103:45
with life it's white it's just beautiful
103:48
as glowing his eyes have flames of fire
103:50
blue flames of fire and he's got the
103:52
most gentlest spirit
103:54
I tell people Jesus is the Waring one
103:57
Jesus is the warring King me but the
104:00
father has such love in him because of
104:03
his son before his sudden you know he
104:05
would pour out his wrath on the others
104:06
and remember that he wiped it out
104:08
remember only did that he's not like
104:10
that anymore because of what his son
104:12
paid for he's loved itself
104:15
kindness itself and he took my hand I've
104:19
been doing this probably for several
104:20
years you took my hand he said come I'm
104:22
gonna take you into my chamber and it
104:26
said on it chamber of understanding and
104:28
it was this place like this massive
104:30
gemstone a huge massive gemstone because
104:33
you have to remember the stones of fire
104:34
are in him we he has one that's his own
104:37
special place that he takes people to
104:40
especially when they come home to heaven
104:41
so he can get to know you better and so
104:44
I walked in there I wasn't afraid of
104:45
anything and then it was this whirlwind
104:48
of the dark glory and that says I hide
104:52
myself in the dark remember the dark
104:54
clouds of glory it looks like a million
104:56
peacock feathers with eyes in them with
105:00
real eyes and that's what he sometimes
105:03
will hide himself in and but when I
105:04
stepped in there with him they were gone
105:06
it was this beautiful place and that
105:07
wasn't massive outside but inside it was
105:09
like it looks like it went forever and
105:11
he looked at me said where would you
105:13
like to go and I said well I want to be
105:16
right here with you I don't need to go
105:18
anywhere he said I can take you to the
105:19
future I can show you the new earth I
105:22
didn't show you things to come on what
105:24
no I know I want to be here with you
105:26
like I I want to be here with you I
105:28
don't need to go in order goes I can
105:30
take you to the past I can show you
105:33
heaven before Lucifer fell I can show
105:36
you before the earth was made don't you
105:39
want to go and I said no right here it's
105:45
where my heart is my heart is for you my
105:51
heart is to do you will you love me
105:54
before I came enough to send your son
105:56
that you love so much that even at one
105:59
point had to turn your very back on him
106:02
because of he had to take all the evil
106:04
and I'm just a little girl saying this
106:06
to him
106:07
Hey
106:13
because you wanted me just like me and
106:17
there's no greater place anyone could
106:20
ever desire to be tend to be with me and
106:24
so I know it blessed his heart so much
106:27
that's why I remember it so clearly that
106:30
it was burned in me and I can't see him
106:35
any other way I can't see him as a god
106:37
of Wrath I can't see him as a God of
106:39
anger or vengeance or a wanting to pour
106:42
something up on you if he is willing to
106:45
give the most precious thing he had for
106:48
us before even while we were yet sinners
106:51
he sent his precious son who was
106:55
everything they did everything together
106:57
before even became Jesus when he was the
107:00
word they created together they went
107:02
everywhere together and he was willing
107:05
to send them you know why so we could
107:07
come back to him that's how much he
107:10
loves people he loves them that's why he
107:13
is long-suffering that's why he said he
107:15
doesn't even want the vilest sinner set
107:17
free but we have to make a choice he
107:22
won't force people to take him and I
107:25
know right now there's people preaching
107:27
that God's going to restore all things
107:30
and they throw in that when they say
107:32
that they literally mean everything he's
107:34
gonna not make a new earth he's gonna
107:36
restore this one he's gonna forgive
107:38
Satan he's gonna remove the fallen
107:40
angels he's gonna make it like it never
107:41
happened that is not what he said and I
107:44
would just say what he said to me
107:46
he said I cannot allow things to come to
107:50
this holy place he said I gave my son
107:53
I'm not keeping you out of heaven I'm
107:55
making a way for you to come to heaven
107:57
because I am not allowing or permitting
108:02
evil wickedness sin to come back into
108:06
this place again and pollute I can't do
108:09
it so I'm not doing something to keep
108:11
you out I did something to let you come
108:13
in but you have to make that choice he
108:17
says so people who say a loving God
108:19
wouldn't send people to hell I don't I
108:21
make a way so they don't have
108:23
go there but they will choose their self
108:25
where they will live so he is a loving
108:29
God but he doesn't want you wouldn't
108:31
want
108:31
he said if I let everyone on earth who
108:34
ever existed to come to heaven then
108:36
heaven would be just like the earth and
108:41
that is not going to happen you would
108:45
not want that to happen yourself so
108:47
unfortunately there are people in hell I
108:50
have been to hell he won't let me talk
108:52
about it because he's still introducing
108:54
heaven it's real it's worse than you
108:57
ever dreamed like heaven is great or
109:00
Mabuse 11 then you ever great dreamed
109:04
Satan loves nobody well I give yourself
109:09
I'm not willing so praise that you won't
109:13
be willing and you will learn to forgive
109:15
and you will learn to but this is the
109:18
thing you can share love love is the
109:19
greatest thing he ever made but love
109:22
includes truth I used to say you can't
109:25
give love and not give truth because
109:27
you're not really loving but actually
109:28
it's part of it so if you love you have
109:30
to share the truth amen
109:33
so don't leave it out somewhere and just
109:35
only share love he'll love people all
109:37
the way to hell because they're choosing
109:39
that love is a wonderful way to show
109:42
them you care and he cares but you can't
109:45
leave out the truth amen
109:49
so any more questions oh she has a
109:54
question from Facebook oh let her answer
109:59
yes we're we want to know what God wants
110:02
to do for Colorado and we were battling
110:06
Hell here and we need help
110:09
from heaven to overcome the fifth chair
110:12
I do know that and so does God he's not
110:17
ignorant to anything and Colorado is
110:20
also gonna be a region of light
110:23
and let me tell you what the people
110:26
sitting in this room have Authority
110:28
enough to do that you don't need to look
110:34
to heaven to bring a lightning bolt down
110:36
here strike someone dead that you don't
110:38
like who is in office it's your
110:41
authority taking over the evil the
110:44
demonic that is ruling that is
110:47
controlling those people that's why we
110:50
were given an army they will bombard
110:52
continually send them continually to
110:55
wherever that person sits whatever their
110:57
title is send them against the demonic
111:00
controlling them I will also add this
111:05
we're living in a time where if they
111:08
won't yield God will take them from the
111:10
earth that would be his last choice but
111:16
because of this time were in that he
111:18
calls holy and powerful for us he wants
111:21
us especially if it's a place he calls
111:23
his own and I don't know why he some
111:27
would be regions of light popping
111:28
because of who will choose to live in
111:30
those places reasons the regions of
111:32
darkness and talk too fast regions of
111:35
darkness will exist because people want
111:38
them and the regions of light will begin
111:43
to produce the glory of God and those
111:46
people will run from those places
111:48
because they so want the evil they still
111:51
want to live that way they want that
111:53
lifestyle they will not be able to live
111:55
in a place for God the glory of God is
111:57
powerful and the reason it's powerful is
111:59
because you're carrying it it's not a
112:01
great wave coming from heaven to sit on
112:04
a place it will be in us Christ in us is
112:09
the hope of glory that glory will become
112:11
a region in places in the earth so what
112:16
you do is begin to live more like God
112:18
declare like him hear him come against
112:23
any evil entities spiritual entities and
112:26
they will begin to be driven out and
112:29
then the influence they had over those
112:32
people will be gone and fear will fall
112:35
on those
112:35
who are leading that's how it works so
112:40
it's in you and the way you live your
112:45
life and what you say and how you
112:48
operate is what will change things in
112:51
this earth Damon okay we're gonna let
112:55
somebody on line ask a question you can
113:00
I have the microphone I wasn't gonna ask
113:03
any of these questions I told him on
113:05
Facebook that I was screams taking
113:07
screenshots of them to save them for a
113:09
future podcast but this one needs to be
113:14
answered and I know you've talked about
113:17
this before but it's kind of a two-part
113:18
question the first part she said can a
113:22
believer who commits suicide go to
113:24
heaven and the reason she asked is
113:27
because Judas had committed suicide in
113:31
the Bible but a young girl said that she
113:34
saw him in heaven I don't know who the
113:37
young girl was but he is in hell and
113:39
even Jesus himself said that he did not
113:42
remain with him number one Judas was
113:45
never a true believer he fought against
113:49
everything Jesus did he wanted Jesus to
113:51
take over the world so he would benefit
113:53
from it he did not have any love for him
113:55
at all and he gave himself to Satan he
113:58
never repented for what he did he went
114:01
out for the guilt he had he hung himself
114:04
judas is in hell and Jesus said father I
114:08
have all those that you gave me save the
114:09
son of perdition he did not have him
114:12
because he was in hell well I can answer
114:15
the other part of that question why she
114:17
probably thought she saw him there is a
114:19
mock heaven in a mock Hell there are
114:21
things that are built in the spirit
114:23
realm there's there all around you a lot
114:27
of them are built by heaven and heaven
114:29
uses them when their angels are sent on
114:31
an assignment there's also something
114:32
built by Hell not very well none of
114:35
their stuff looks very good but they
114:37
have places for the demons to gather and
114:40
in infiltrate places and stuff like that
114:42
and they have built to bring confusion
114:45
to the body because the father is
114:46
catching so many people up to heaven
114:48
and so many people down to hell Satan
114:50
always does something to try to stop it
114:54
bring confusion or counteract it so it
114:57
would look like somebody's not telling
114:58
the truth and one of those places is a
115:00
mock hell and this is the thing about
115:03
the enemy when he thinks he's winning he
115:05
gets very sloppy and then he becomes not
115:08
intelligent and then he'll show people
115:10
he'll this is something you have to test
115:12
spirits if an angel comes up you said
115:15
I'm here to take you somewhere you have
115:16
to say are you from the spirit of the
115:18
Most High God who sent his son you die
115:20
it's very simple you ask them that they
115:22
can't lie there's no way they cannot
115:25
they will disappear or they'll say
115:27
nothing to you but most people just go
115:29
with them and if you go that means
115:33
you're open to be shown whatever if it's
115:35
not an angel there's still demons that
115:37
can have a measure of light in them now
115:40
every one of them look like defiled
115:41
horrible ugly things so if people don't
115:44
ask like someone a leader in the body
115:47
was caught up by supposing aliens to be
115:51
to Saturn did the wings of Saturn and
115:52
this actually happened and they didn't
115:55
test them so they went to the rings of
115:57
Saturn by these demons who said they
115:59
were aliens and they gave them higher
116:00
enlightenment to know about the gods of
116:03
the Egyptians and now they have rejected
116:04
Jesus Christ they date everything we
116:07
judge did everything about him said they
116:09
now serve the God of the Egyptians
116:10
that's why you have to test spirits so
116:13
that was not real saddened by the way
116:14
there was a mock place made in the
116:18
spirit realm to look like that okay
116:24
something that is just very right now
116:27
it's really critical because a lot of
116:30
people are talking about this the
116:31
ascension movement where they get in
116:34
groups and as an act of their will they
116:38
are all group lifted to what they say is
116:42
heaven could they be actually going to a
116:45
mock realm that is is a counterfeit
116:50
since I've never been a part of that
116:52
group I know things like that happen and
116:54
there's always the chance of that
116:57
happening if you don't have the
116:58
opportunity to question who is taking
117:01
you
117:02
I do know that people are doing that I
117:04
know some people got his commission to
117:06
do that there's some people who decide
117:08
in their own soul to do it their self
117:11
that is not wise because we do within us
117:16
the way God made us we do have different
117:18
authorities within us we have abilities
117:21
to come in and speak to things and
117:23
that's how a lot of people got caught in
117:25
the New Age movement years ago now
117:28
people are caught in to all kinds of
117:30
things and they don't understand it's
117:32
not God because this is saying if they
117:34
have a real encounter that's the point
117:37
they made I had a real encounter when a
117:40
lot of people have real encounters but
117:42
where did you go and who took you there
117:45
that's how Satan gets away with these
117:47
mock places and he's caught all kinds of
117:51
people to the mock heaven and they all
117:53
meet mother Mary who was ruling there
117:58
there's always some kind of a thing that
118:00
gives you hints something's not right
118:02
always because I've heard of many
118:04
encounters people have and there's
118:07
always a measure of something that is
118:08
not truth people are caught in the mock
118:11
hell they're shown children in hell that
118:13
is absolutely a lie there are no
118:16
children in hell these people have also
118:18
seen and talked with mother Mary in
118:22
heaven that is not true
118:24
she does not call herself that she is
118:26
Mary who bore Jesus but she worshiped
118:30
worships Jesus Christ as her own Savior
118:32
and then more encounter started building
118:35
and building Satan took a lot of people
118:37
to hell because he enjoyed it and it
118:39
wasn't even the real hell because if
118:41
they had been to the real hell they'd
118:43
still be screaming they wouldn't act
118:46
like it was so nonchalant well I saw
118:48
Christians there and I was told they
118:50
won't help because they wore blue jeans
118:52
how many people got blue jeans on them
118:54
and then they were told that the
118:57
Christians weren't helped because they
118:58
had colored highlights in their hair and
119:01
then somebody else was taken to the mock
119:04
Kalen they were said they're always told
119:06
these are Christians
119:07
these are Christians because they wore
119:09
jewelry the horrible part about it is
119:13
these people believe it because they
119:15
were little
119:16
taken by a spiritual being through the
119:20
spirit room to a place that to them was
119:23
literally real so that's why it's you
119:28
need an understanding of the spirit
119:29
realm you need to understand what that
119:31
place is it's the original realm that
119:34
God made it was made before the physical
119:36
realm in order to make this physical
119:38
planet he had to take like a canvas the
119:42
physical realm and stretch it around
119:43
part of the spiritual realm so we could
119:46
hang all the planets in the sky so we
119:48
would have a place to live and have
119:50
physical body so this stuff happens but
119:54
Satan still has powers I mean he'll do
119:58
anything you can to lie to people if you
120:00
can get them to to be deceived and they
120:03
say yes then they can be taken to places
120:06
and he'll say as an angel light this is
120:09
now your assignment years ago all of
120:10
this world and share this truth and it's
120:12
a lie so it's bringing confusion to the
120:15
body because people thought well I
120:16
thought I thought you couldn't fake
120:19
anything well if you believe the father
120:21
of lies and he's one who created the lie
120:23
yes but there's a way not to be deceived
120:27
okay number one don't want after things
120:30
that you're not aware of or how to
120:32
operate in those places God give you
120:34
commissions if an angel really came from
120:37
him and was supposed to take you you can
120:38
ask that angel if he says yes I was sent
120:41
by the Most High then you should
120:42
certainly go but but this is happening
120:45
everywhere and I've even seen some
120:47
people on shows talking about their
120:51
experiences in Hell and they didn't go
120:52
to the real hell they didn't go to the
120:55
real heaven okay they never talk about
120:57
the glory the splendor the love of God
120:59
they always talk about people who would
121:02
not I've heard him talk about people
121:04
that wouldn't be in heaven I've also
121:05
talked about people who they say are in
121:08
Hell and are not in Hell so you have to
121:11
know who's sharing and you have to know
121:13
yourself how to discern the spirit and
121:15
so if anything comes to you and sit just
121:18
was to go with me you would do if it was
121:21
a person wouldn't it I mean if some
121:23
stranger came to your door and said
121:25
you're supposed to go with me I'm gonna
121:26
take you so and so we're going to go to
121:28
the White House go that would you
121:29
with that person I hope not well it's no
121:32
difference in the spirit room so you
121:35
just have to know who is talking to you
121:38
and if they have the right to talk to
121:40
you you always have the right to refuse
121:41
and if you refuse this God and you've
121:46
tested them they said yes I'm from God
121:47
and you don't go he'll probably give you
121:50
another chance and we're done the line
121:51
to go so yes yes and Satan in the in the
121:58
day is coming one of the one of the
122:00
there's we know their signs and wonders
122:02
but to be unholy signs and wonders it
122:05
talks about them in the Bible too and
122:07
this is the thing he will heal people
122:10
they'll actually have witches don't
122:12
trust a witch don't watch witchcraft
122:14
don't read witchcraft have nothing to do
122:15
with witchcraft
122:16
witchcraft is real it was real back in
122:19
the day of Jesus is still real now and
122:22
none of it is good none of it it is the
122:28
most controlling thing you can get
122:30
involved with and you will be deceived
122:32
over and over again and that's not a
122:34
good thing and this is what Satan will
122:36
do he'll have because people be having
122:39
miracles everywhere right so Satan will
122:41
have his own in the park and they'll say
122:43
these witches will say come and join us
122:45
we're a good coven we love people we can
122:47
heal you do you have something needs to
122:48
be healed and they'll heal them in front
122:50
of everybody
122:51
all Satan has to do is remove the
122:54
disease that he put there and it will be
122:59
a mock healing just to bring deception
123:02
to people so we're a little ways away
123:04
from that happening but as much as you
123:06
can get understanding on the better your
123:09
prepared but I will just say this to you
123:11
Satan has used Harry Potter for years to
123:14
introduce witchcraft is being good if
123:16
you read it loose it from your soul if
123:18
you have it get rid of it if you just
123:20
watch it lay their hands and loose it
123:22
from their soul because the author hates
123:26
Christians and they literally practice
123:30
witchcraft and that book I've never read
123:33
it but people tell me stuff in it some
123:35
of those acts that they do in those
123:37
books and now this they sell spell kits
123:39
is real witch cloud
123:42
there are even a Harry Potter University
123:44
being built in Richmond Virginia
123:47
and guess how many people Robbie's in
123:49
there because it's a fantasy they think
123:52
and not a fantasy nothing from hell is a
123:57
fantasy amen so there's always there's
124:00
always good stuff to share with you
124:02
powerful stuff to share with you but but
124:04
if you can receive a warning that will
124:06
save you a lot of stuff later in your
124:08
life then just receive it because I do
124:12
know I'm going to see her since there's
124:15
a little girl and I saw operations of
124:16
Hell everywhere I know what they do to
124:19
trick people mark people follow people
124:21
so when you send get marked by the enemy
124:24
then they follow you and try to get you
124:25
to fall again so nothing's being hidden
124:28
there's an unseen world sees you all the
124:30
time okay so live up right right just
124:34
get rid of the junk get rid of it
124:37
it'll be like it was never there enemy
124:39
will have no way to track you or find
124:41
you and he should have nothing to do
124:44
with you no right to do anything to you
124:47
and you can say that too but the good
124:49
news is this we're entering into a time
124:52
where you have to understand the more of
124:55
God the spirit realm around you which
124:57
has always been here I see beings
125:00
operating everywhere all the time even
125:02
here what I've been present in the hotel
125:04
outside the hotel everywhere I go I see
125:06
activities
125:07
I am purpose sometimes we'll say
125:09
something to the demons because they
125:11
don't think you can see them I make sure
125:16
they know who I believe then I ask the
125:18
host to go attack them then they run
125:19
screaming down the street the host is
125:21
just falling behind and whacking them
125:22
with their sword you know crushing them
125:25
and so I reek havoc wherever I go that's
125:30
good and there are kids doing it right
125:32
now
125:32
their children will be raised in this
125:35
time to begin to know we find out about
125:38
the glory we will get to carry the glory
125:41
but our kids will live in the glory and
125:43
their kids will know nothing but the
125:46
glory which is why God needs generations
125:50
on the earth when you start something
125:52
new
125:53
he needs generally
125:54
in order for it to operate so I can say
125:57
if you're young you have a long powerful
126:00
life ahead of you and if you're not
126:03
young asked to be timeless and get ready
126:06
to live longer because you have a
126:07
decision to make for God you don't have
126:10
to be bound by time even now if you
126:13
choose not to so this is a great time to
126:16
be on the earth I think we'll probably
126:17
take one more one more question does he
126:20
have a question oh I want to hear his
126:22
question okay he was curious to know if
126:27
you could describe what heaven looks
126:28
like specifically wondering is it bright
126:30
yellow is it golden but if you could
126:34
maybe describe its characteristics
126:36
landscapes just I I can share Hume in
126:39
this but I've seen so much of it it is
126:42
all light there's no darkness in heaven
126:45
nobody ever sleeps because they never
126:47
get tired they have rainbow bridges they
126:50
have arrogance they can fly on they have
126:53
dinosaurs you can ride on they have
126:55
fountains filled with chocolate and home
126:57
is made out of jell-o you can eat they
127:00
have a fantastic you can go into cartoon
127:02
village and write a cartoon out and then
127:04
you go in and you are it okay this is
127:08
heaven this is really heaven they have
127:10
rodeos they have they have they have
127:13
hunting but you do it with a camera the
127:17
point is this when you hunt the creature
127:19
you're looking for a supernatural
127:20
spiritual being it will get you before
127:23
you ever get it you go back to the
127:26
clubhouse and there's your face
127:28
plastered on a 40-foot screen because
127:31
the creature you're looking for
127:33
got you first they celebrate Christmas
127:36
in heaven everybody will end with this
127:39
one who is it oh the friendly forest
127:44
there is a friendly forest where the
127:46
trees talk and they will sing and dance
127:48
with you even the stones little stones
127:51
pebbles jump up and down with faces and
127:53
they sing glories to God the tree cannot
127:56
brood itself and go to your mansion and
127:58
root itself and be a friend and talking
128:00
to have conversations with you I've seen
128:03
all of us in heaven my
128:04
sister Jen is writing children's books
128:06
that will show a lot of these scenes in
128:09
heaven for children will know the truth
128:10
about heaven and our Lord and the father
128:13
and the angels angels are made out of
128:16
everything they don't all look like us
128:18
probably half of them don't have our
128:21
creatures they're very fierce through
128:23
the army they have weapons coming out of
128:26
them so trust me the army that bur Texas
128:29
is through hell terrifying the glory of
128:33
God is everywhere father sends a wave of
128:36
his rainbow through heaven to look for
128:38
you and bring you back to himself in the
128:40
throne room you never want to leave
128:43
there they celebrate they have
128:45
celebrations in the throne room works
128:47
like a big party
128:48
they like celebrations sometimes worship
128:51
is just jump it up and down and
128:53
screaming you know like they do here on
128:55
this earth that came from heaven it all
128:57
creates glory for god it's worship for
129:00
god angels love to crowd surf at some of
129:02
the concerts they have in heaven there
129:06
are real beings that have personalities
129:08
they care very much for us God made them
129:11
for us that they're not against you amen
129:14
any other questions oh I have to answer
129:23
that one asked he was asking about if
129:25
anybody commits suicide did they go to
129:27
heaven it depends on of us actually
129:28
suicide or not I was caught up by the
129:32
father on purpose I was going to go to
129:34
Penn State and he said I'm gonna have
129:35
you bust a myth that's been around for a
129:38
long time that people cannot take their
129:41
life and go to heaven he said that
129:43
depends on if this suicide or not he
129:45
said go look up the word suicide in the
129:47
dictionary sometimes yes me do it and it
129:49
says someone who willingly knowingly
129:52
intelligently in the right mind decide
129:57
they're going to end their life usually
129:59
is to hurt people like terrorists like
130:01
terrorist bombers they on purpose choose
130:04
to no longer live they do it usually for
130:07
a horrible purpose but what most people
130:09
are doing aren't ending their life
130:12
they're ending their suffering and God
130:15
says I judge
130:17
and then after he said that he took me
130:19
three times to heaven people who had
130:21
ended their suffering but loved Jesus
130:23
Christ they all three were in heaven
130:25
they did not want to stop living they
130:28
loved their families but they saw no
130:30
other escape the pain was so great they
130:32
had some of them one had mental issues
130:34
one had medical issues one had emotional
130:38
issues and and most of the time one of
130:40
it was from medicine that was given them
130:41
to heal them it gave them trauma and
130:44
continual suicidal thoughts flooded them
130:47
and today I can't handle this anymore
130:49
I'm going home to Jesus and they ended
130:52
their suffering and God said I don't
130:53
want everyone thinking their loved ones
130:56
who knew me who believed in me who
130:58
trusted me even if they fell for some
131:02
reason but they never gave me up or quit
131:04
loving me and something happened and
131:07
their life ended they are not in hell he
131:11
said I would be an unjust god if I took
131:13
somebody who loved me and served me and
131:15
they had an accident and something
131:18
happened physically to their head that
131:20
they weren't thinking right all they
131:22
knew was pain and agony and they
131:24
couldn't live they couldn't handle the
131:26
suffering or the thing with the medicine
131:28
that actually happens a lot they even
131:30
have things on bottles that say it could
131:32
give you suicidal thoughts and so God
131:34
said I'm gonna make sure you understand
131:35
this he put despair on me despair is
131:39
what comes right before suicide and you
131:41
begin to have those thoughts he made me
131:43
carry it for a week and tell nobody and
131:47
all I could think in my head it was like
131:50
I was literally experiencing it there
131:52
was no I felt no hope and this is and I
131:55
knew him there was no hope in my mind
131:57
that this would ever end all I could
131:59
think of was I'm getting out of here
132:01
I can't bear to be here this is so great
132:04
I wanted to be taken but he wouldn't
132:06
take it from me he told me first he said
132:09
I will not take it off of you at the end
132:10
of the week I will take it off of you
132:12
and you will never forget what that felt
132:13
like
132:13
and you understand my people cannot take
132:16
the agony or the suffering of that
132:18
bombarding them all the time and it was
132:20
horrible at the end of the week it was
132:22
like it never happened and what huh I'm
132:24
gonna go share that message everywhere
132:26
and after that I went to Pennsylvania
132:27
for the first time and shared that
132:29
message
132:30
and I found out several people in the
132:32
meeting had had loved ones who had done
132:34
that they all ran down front they were
132:35
crying they were hanging on to me and
132:37
there was even a well-known person I
132:40
won't mention their name that their son
132:42
took his life his ended his suffering
132:45
and he had been in an accident a
132:47
well-known person and so this young man
132:51
has served God his whole life he was
132:53
like in his late 20s loved Jesus but all
132:56
he kept saying was I can't handle this
132:58
he'd been an accident they gave him this
133:00
medicine they took him off the medicine
133:02
they had to put him back on the medicine
133:03
and he finally said I can't I'm leaving
133:05
I'm leaving he kept telling I'm leaving
133:07
and then they found him and he was dead
133:09
and God and he was coming to our city to
133:12
speak and God said his wife is hiding
133:15
herself
133:15
the mother is hiding herself because of
133:17
all the believer saying is too bad your
133:20
son is burning in hell the world didn't
133:26
say that the world this is the awful
133:27
part the world said were so sorry for
133:30
your loss you know we want to help
133:32
console' you we want to comfort you this
133:34
is the world but the ones in the body
133:38
were saying
133:39
instantly he was burning in hell so she
133:42
hid she wouldn't come out she wouldn't
133:44
go anywhere she didn't want her face to
133:46
be seen and she was grieving already
133:48
right and God said I'm not tolerating
133:51
this I'm gonna let them know exactly
133:53
what their son is doing he caught me up
133:54
to heaven I saw their son I didn't know
133:57
about them and how was taken to his
133:59
father's managing because this man was
134:01
young and I was taken to his father's
134:03
literally his father's managin being
134:05
built in heaven and it had this great
134:07
mantle it was at the foot of the
134:09
mountain of spices and it was absolutely
134:11
beautiful and that's where he was
134:13
staying at that time and there was a
134:14
trophy on the mantle that said Satan 0
134:18
God 1 and it was he was saying that
134:23
Satan did not get their son then it was
134:26
walked to the management
134:27
I saw siblings that weren't even born
134:30
yet in photographs in this person's
134:33
mansion and then I saw the son another
134:36
time he was packing up a horse he was
134:39
going to go to the mountain of spices to
134:40
go do a hunt and he said I wish my dad
134:43
knew
134:44
there's a new way to shoot animals that
134:46
won't hurt them and he was packing
134:48
camera gear so this is how I found out
134:50
about the hunting and he was going up
134:52
into these woods to go hunting and he
134:54
said man I remember all the fun I had
134:56
with my dad and my brothers one who did
134:57
this
134:58
but it's even better now and so I saw
135:00
these creatures hunting behind the trees
135:02
I'm sure there was some of the ones he
135:04
was going to try to get I saw him stop
135:06
by the clubhouse and register that he
135:08
was going on this hunt so if he if his
135:10
scope got the picture that it would be
135:13
put up there your picture okay is in the
135:16
in the in the corner the one who took
135:18
the picture the one they captured is on
135:21
the screen most of the time the
135:25
creatures here in Europe they're on the
135:27
screen so all that was happening and I
135:29
wrote three pages three days in a row
135:31
God took me to heaven and showed me the
135:33
Sun I was also taken into his mother's
135:35
mansion which was right next door had
135:37
the name of the family over this part
135:39
because they were like I called him like
135:41
like community or family mansions like
135:43
you live in a whole wing of your own
135:45
this wing could be like fifty thousand
135:47
hundred thousand square feet it could be
135:49
half the size of a city because God's
135:52
gracious and so I typed all this up he
135:55
was coming to speak I took it to my
135:56
pastor and said I got this word he read
135:58
it he was crying goes you make sure he
136:00
gets that word they are suffering so
136:02
much he said I'm an agreement with his
136:04
word that hit their son it changed him
136:06
forever it changed his mom came out of
136:09
hiding she was filled with joining the
136:11
celebration the father was weeping to
136:13
know that God cared enough to show that
136:15
his son were his son was I didn't know
136:18
where they lived they lived at the big
136:21
mountains at the bottom of the big
136:23
mountains in Colorado and so he said
136:26
that's why I made their mansions there
136:28
because I knew they would love it and he
136:30
said and and and this person said we
136:33
went hunting I took my son's hunting all
136:34
the time well it wasn't really to kill
136:36
something as much as it was to have the
136:38
experience of being together and then
136:40
all these things I saw was exactly the
136:43
way they lived their life things he said
136:46
himself for his mother
136:47
I saw him wearing plaid like this plaid
136:50
shirt and jeans and that was exactly
136:52
what it was wearing when they found him
136:54
so every over and over again
136:58
I saw things that disconfirmed them that
137:01
their son was in heaven amen so thank
137:17
you thank you

00:16
set up we have baskets up here and those
00:19
are offering baskets hi Susan good to
00:22
see you sister offering baskets if you
00:25
hear something which you will and when
00:27
you hear something that you want to sow
00:28
into and grab it you sow into it
00:32
we want to bless her so much when she
00:34
goes back she's gonna freak out when she
00:36
sees the multiplication that happens
00:38
because she is a prophetess and we want
00:42
to bless the prophetess in her ministry
00:44
so so because she's gonna go and we're
00:47
gonna pass baskets at the end but if you
00:48
have to leave early please make your way
00:50
up here if you don't if that weirds you
00:53
out to come up then give it to one of
00:56
the ushers that are standing in the back
00:58
and they will receive that offering and
01:00
put it in the offering basket for you
01:14
can you turn her up Lisa please
01:29
oh now you can hear me okay
01:38
yeah I can hear now it's just making is
01:45
that making it rain I'm always excited
01:51
to come here because I don't have you
01:54
know boundaries put on me some places
02:04
just afraid of the new and actually it's
02:07
not really new it's just being revealed
02:10
and all through time God has done that
02:14
when it was his time to do something new
02:16
it was revealed in the earth it was
02:19
always his plan we're just finding out
02:22
about it and that's true in every age
02:25
this come on this earth God has done
02:27
something new new things to say new ways
02:31
to live new ways to operate like them
02:35
because the Bible says we're supposed to
02:38
do that right course food who are we
02:41
supposed to be like say Jesus really
02:45
loud does he want us to operate like he
02:49
did then don't be afraid to do it you
02:54
know I'm not afraid of the face of man
02:56
that's not gonna work I've already been
03:00
in his presence I know what his heart is
03:04
I know what the father's plans are for
03:06
the sir it's not time to end it yet
03:11
I tell people stop fighting about the
03:14
time when you want to escape on your
03:16
rapture odd I have news for everybody
03:20
the rapture is not an escape
03:24
it will be a celebration isn't that true
03:31
it's a celebration because an escape
03:36
would be fear and he has nothing to do
03:39
with fear and neither should you there
03:43
should be no fear in you God holds you
03:49
in his hand when he's ready he's taking
03:51
you home nobody can stop that but if he
03:54
want you to stay nobody can stop that
03:56
either you know John could have stayed
04:01
John the Beloved could still be here
04:04
amongst us if he decided to stay because
04:09
Jesus said to the disciples what is it
04:11
you but I love him to remain until they
04:14
come again has he come again yet
04:17
then that means John could be here
04:19
correct how long would that have been so
04:24
if God decides to keep somebody two
04:26
hundred three hundred four hundred five
04:28
hundred years now what is it you I'm
04:33
saying yes by the way I won't even buy a
04:38
life insurance policy my staff walked
04:41
into the phone when people want to sell
04:43
life insurance oh she doesn't want it
04:46
well can we ask her no it won't do any
04:49
good but everybody needs it and they go
04:51
no she's not planning on dying and then
04:55
they hang up
04:59
and we all laughed for that but I'm not
05:01
I have no plans I lay down my life I
05:05
live in him as long as he wants me here
05:07
I'm staying I know John missed what he
05:13
saw he missed it so much he couldn't
05:17
stand to be here anymore
05:19
nobody took his life either nobody
05:25
killed him no disease took his life he
05:30
decided to go how about that it's people
05:36
go oh no you you can't choose with this
05:38
day or not yes I can I can choose that
05:42
it's up to him when I go but I don't
05:49
want to go I'm not missing anything I'm
05:53
not missing anything he's gonna do on
05:55
this earth as long as he wants me to
05:58
here be here I'm staying and one day I
06:03
want you to plan to come here I'm just
06:05
letting you know that I'll just show up
06:08
I walked through the wall I've been here
06:10
on the blackboard in heaven they have no
06:16
time I want to live that way I want to
06:24
be just like them let us make man in our
06:28
image and after all excuse me I've been
06:30
talking so much I don't know where I
06:32
left my water I think it's on the floor
06:35
that's somewhere I'll be sharing about
06:39
this a little bit but I just got back
06:40
from Hollywood and I talked non-stop I
06:44
did make some side meetings so I'm not
06:46
even talking about the meetings I did
06:49
I'm talking about the producer I met
06:52
with
06:53
[Music]
06:56
God is taking Hollywood
06:59
I mean seriously he is taking it and
07:12
he'll is terrified no he'll can get mad
07:20
but the time will come when they get so
07:23
afraid of you you become dangerous
07:29
well I'm dangerous and when I go in
07:34
somewhere in Hollywood they run out they
07:37
won't they won't they can't stand to be
07:39
near me they don't want to be near me
07:40
they will burn like they will literally
07:42
burn and they'll feel the pain I'm of
07:47
sure one day says make them feel the
07:48
pain and on the back will be a devil and
07:52
they'll be going like this I want to
07:58
share a couple things though before I
08:00
actually start because I almost never do
08:02
this but we actually have some new
08:03
things
08:04
we're in Phase two of what God called me
08:06
to do the first whole half not half the
08:10
first season I had in doing this was to
08:12
reveal heaven to earth the second season
08:15
is to create heaven on earth that season
08:19
will be much longer than the first one
08:21
it's still a way to reveal it but why
08:24
not be able to hold it or wear it or sit
08:26
on it or watch or have it in your walls
08:29
or have it in your floors heaven is
08:33
invading literally invading people's
08:35
lives everywhere in ways that we maybe
08:38
not expect one of it is going to be the
08:42
movie industry and so God is making us
08:46
extremely bold about what we say so
08:49
there's no question when you're in that
08:51
arena you need to make sure there's no
08:53
question about who you represent I'm
08:57
gonna make that perfectly clear
09:00
and then the Holy Spirit always gives us
09:02
new little we call them Kingdom quotes
09:04
but they're actually Holy Spirit quotes
09:06
he makes me save him I purpose because
09:08
he likes to hear them and our newest one
09:12
is I don't do demons in case hell should
09:20
wander by we want to make sure they
09:22
remember the day they were kicked out
09:23
with a lightning bolt which is right in
09:25
the middle there you go bring back back
09:28
back to the remembrance in case they
09:31
forgot so this is a car magnet we don't
09:35
do traditional bumper stickers just can
09:36
go on your car and it's huge
09:39
[Laughter]
09:42
it does get looks we just released it
09:45
about a month ago we have buttons that
09:47
you can wear and talk about you want to
09:49
make a conversation just wear one and
09:51
walk somewhere and people love
09:56
especially in our country they love to
09:58
read any kind of a sign or button you're
10:01
wearing or t-shirt or cap that you have
10:03
to see what it says they literally have
10:07
to see it and I've seen people follow
10:09
people down the street so they can
10:10
finally read the bumper sticker so now
10:14
they see this and right along with this
10:18
one we have other ones we have one that
10:20
says roll up your wraps your rug and
10:21
rule
10:29
okay so right there's I don't do demons
10:31
roll up your rapture rug and rule there
10:33
you go what does that mean one of my
10:38
staff said why don't we just say roll up
10:40
your wraps are there every Baptists on
10:42
the earth could be so mad at us they'd
10:44
be thrown things out so we got to say
10:46
why okay why number one it is not time
10:50
for the rapture right now we haven't
10:52
occupied that means take Dominion take
10:57
Dominion deucey do something powerful
11:00
with your life I will I'd I had to read
11:10
an entire movie script in 20 hours
11:15
because I will be editing it thank God
11:22
Margaret was with me and this can be
11:25
powerful not like anything you have seen
11:27
on this earth anywhere not anywhere at
11:35
all and so we also have along with the
11:38
census since this is the Holy Spirit's
11:40
favorite quote right now we also have a
11:43
cup cozies and if I can get it on here I
11:46
might it does if it fits water bottles
11:51
but it also fits cups and then make it
11:53
fit this one now nobody has these yet it
11:58
also says I don't do demons take your
12:01
water bottle to work set it around
12:05
you will stir up things so these are
12:12
brand new and everything we have is made
12:15
in America since I'm going to market
12:20
this okay
12:22
this is sewn on two sides but it lays
12:24
flat for traveling we plan to take
12:27
hundreds of these overseas with us and
12:29
and it says they don't do demons and on
12:32
the back is where you can find out more
12:33
revealing heaven calm and the Holy
12:36
Spirit picks the colors everything he
12:38
wanted to make sure you could see this a
12:40
mile away okay so this is another thing
12:42
we've got right here we we have we have
12:46
gone back because we used to have these
12:48
when I first started we didn't have any
12:50
maintenance so we've had some new ones
12:52
made it does have the book cover on it
12:54
revealing heaven we'll have a book to
12:56
also have one with its colors and when I
12:59
get booked three them will do that this
13:01
is also made in America this opens and
13:03
shuts it does not come off and this
13:06
however you get it off you snap it off
13:09
but look how hard that is this double
13:11
double pane double insulated made in
13:14
America dishwasher safe microwave-safe
13:18
how about that and yeah for hot or cold
13:22
and it works we've tested all of our own
13:24
stuff so I love that we can put maybe
13:27
this is our newest one it literally just
13:29
came out hey we made this thing as big
13:33
as the magnet are you kidding 22 ounces
13:37
I don't do jima
13:40
that's good because this one is yours
13:44
and I love the colors we make sure
13:46
everything matches well you know the
13:48
Holy Spirit doesn't like a lot of
13:49
clutter on things because they want you
13:51
to see what it's sayin right and so this
13:55
is our newest one we literally just got
13:56
them I love them and because we're
13:59
making a statement this is what the Holy
14:00
Spirit said you're making a statement
14:02
about who you are and what you stand for
14:06
without blasting any other denomination
14:09
or religion you're literally can safely
14:15
if you care make a statement about what
14:18
you believe in what you don't tolerate
14:19
and people are sowing dunks they've
14:22
never seen anything like this before you
14:25
know it's either something very liberal
14:27
or demonic or you might have a cross on
14:30
something but God is into saying very
14:33
plainly what he means and this means you
14:37
are not partnering nor tolerating nor
14:40
participating with darkness of any kind
14:42
whatsoever and so people have to say
14:45
well what does that mean well I just
14:47
tell them that means I torment demons
14:49
that's what it means
14:52
and then I quote a scripture you know
14:54
this is what this means this is our
14:56
privilege in this time as the body of
14:59
Christ
14:59
you know God had his time when he kicked
15:01
him out of heaven right when they were
15:04
all became evil and then Jesus had his
15:06
time when he wasted hell on the third
15:08
day and melted the faces of the
15:10
principalities and powers in hell
15:12
stripped their leader of everything took
15:15
every gemstone off that God put on him
15:17
and took the keys of hell death in the
15:19
break so guess who gets the third show
15:24
we do God said oh it's the show he said
15:29
I am a show person all the way I was the
15:31
first show man in the center ring when I
15:34
kicked all those all those demonic
15:36
angels out that they rose up against me
15:38
he said there was light lightning bolt
15:41
there was action they went down
15:46
there was lights and there was action ok
15:48
this is the Sun in hell all darkness you
15:51
know ready for by the way Satan was
15:54
planning a show by the way if you didn't
15:55
know that he was Satan was planning a
15:58
show himself to torture the Son of God
16:00
in front of all of his demons and he
16:02
actually called in the principalities
16:04
and powers because they don't stay in
16:06
Hell they are seated on Thrones on dark
16:10
Thrones all around this world so he
16:13
called them in to hell to the courtyard
16:15
of Hell where he was going to put the
16:17
show on well guess what the Son of God
16:22
put the show on and it says so in the
16:24
Bible he spoiled ruined principalities
16:29
and powers and made a show of it openly
16:33
triumphing in it I call that a show
16:38
there was lights the fire of God coming
16:41
out of his hands there was action the
16:43
melting faces of the principalities and
16:45
there was a lot of noise the demons
16:47
screaming now we get to manifest and
16:50
demonstrate for him in this earth doing
16:52
supernatural signs and wonders the
16:54
greater works stunning hell and shocking
16:57
this world so whether you knew it or not
17:01
you're the 3rd show how about that so we
17:04
like to make things that are you know
17:06
preparing for the show right I'm wearing
17:08
this pin that I wore the first time it
17:11
was in 2016 early in 2016 when the
17:16
elections well the the campaigning was
17:18
going on and it says let the show begin
17:21
and it has begun don't totally begun
17:26
these are these coasters the ones that
17:29
are made out of the pressed whatever
17:31
that is they can get wet and then they
17:34
drown you reuse them reuse them this is
17:36
the weather warriors which we also are
17:39
kind of still in charge of them what are
17:41
the weather warriors we tell the weather
17:43
what it cannot do we're not we're not
17:47
stopping the weather we're stopping the
17:49
destruction of Hell getting in the
17:52
weather when God created weather for
17:56
this earth he did not create it to be
17:58
destructive
17:59
it was a nourish and replenish the earth
18:02
in the winter it was to cover up like
18:04
the earth thrust right and and it does a
18:07
lot of other things like kill the
18:08
insects and the bugs
18:10
unfortunately in Florida we don't get a
18:12
lot of snow we didn't get a lot we don't
18:16
get a lot of that down there but other
18:18
places have it so God designed this
18:21
earth to operate in a certain way but
18:24
since there's a wicked evil being who
18:26
hates everyone and including the earth
18:29
here he has tried to take over himself
18:32
and yet the Bible clearly says Jesus
18:35
gave us power this is not my message yet
18:37
this is my introduction the word clearly
18:41
says that Jesus said to all believers I
18:45
give you power over the power of the
18:53
enemy so this is using that power right
18:59
here God did did not design hurricanes
19:02
himself Satan gets involved in that and
19:06
gets controlling them he wants to kill
19:09
steal and destroy and he will use that
19:11
in any form of whether he can while
19:15
we're stopping it yes we have a right
19:19
because Jesus said we were joint heirs
19:21
what he did we can do he stopped to
19:26
storm people we actually do that and
19:30
there's a whole lot of people we now
19:32
call them the weather warrior so God had
19:33
us design a logo God is into images
19:36
trust me this is another logo almost
19:39
everything we have it's either a logo or
19:42
it's the beginning of a move of God
19:45
because I don't get to do anything
19:47
that's normal okay
19:48
I'm never gonna be normal
19:52
not ever another thing we have the right
19:56
to do is to command the host of heaven
20:01
some of you may have a problem with this
20:05
don't be concerned about commanding the
20:08
host of heaven that would be the army of
20:11
heaven and and God loves that army he
20:15
designed them to war for us they are not
20:20
protecting heaven
20:22
they never have protected heaven they
20:25
don't need to protect heaven the one who
20:27
made them is on the throne so they've
20:31
never stopped people from coming up into
20:32
heaven and taking things okay although
20:35
somebody translated that word you know
20:38
about the kingdom of heaven suffering
20:40
violence they think that means that
20:41
people from earth are going up there and
20:44
stealing things that literally came out
20:48
of a Bible translation it really did I
20:53
don't know how they got that I don't
20:56
know where that even came from okay that
21:01
scripture has a revelation to it the
21:05
scripture is from the time of John the
21:06
Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven
21:09
suffers violence and the violent take it
21:12
by force is that correct is that what
21:14
that scripture says well everybody's
21:17
focusing on the word suffers because
21:19
they don't understand although
21:20
scripturally there is another meaning
21:22
for that and the Holy Spirit showed me
21:25
think of this scripture suffer the
21:29
little children to come unto me now does
21:33
that mean the little children are being
21:34
attacked say no does that mean that he's
21:40
saying cause the little children to come
21:42
unto me encourage the little children to
21:45
come unto me so let's put that word in
21:47
the other scripture from the time of
21:50
John the Baptist until now the Kingdom
21:52
of Heaven encourages and causes
21:54
spiritual violence to rise up on the
21:57
inside of you so you the believer can
22:00
take it by force
22:01
from the enemy now that scripture makes
22:08
sense doesn't it because it does not
22:11
mean the other thing there's literally
22:14
no way anyone's gonna get up to heaven
22:17
without God's permission amen they want
22:22
us to be spiritually violent that word
22:26
is that means passionately violent
22:29
against the spiritual darkness don't
22:32
tolerate them don't participate with
22:35
them and there's another scripture that
22:37
clearly says that our weapons of warfare
22:41
are not natural they are not physical
22:45
but they are spiritual they say the word
22:48
day they are supernatural and spiritual
22:52
weapons and they pull down what what
22:57
kind of strongholds are they pulling
22:59
down they pull down principalities right
23:01
and strongholds of darkness is that
23:04
right that sounds like an army to me an
23:10
army we've almost been totally ignoring
23:13
for a very long time and yet they were
23:16
created by God for us to be over angels
23:20
are not over us it says in the times to
23:25
come we will judge them does that say
23:27
that the Bible so if we're going to
23:31
judge them then they can't be over us is
23:33
that correct we have some authority over
23:36
them we cannot worship them but
23:40
commanding if you look in the dictionary
23:42
if you look at the word commanding it
23:44
does not mean worship it does not mean
23:48
we're worshipping but I happen to known
23:51
the military must have orders I've had
23:56
so many members of my family in the
23:57
military including my husband was in the
24:00
Marine Corps they cannot work on their
24:03
own can you imagine them running out of
24:06
boot camp taking weapons they barely not
24:08
go in attacking things does that happen
24:11
do they have to have orders from
24:14
headquarters even when they're overseas
24:17
they have somebody over them that has to
24:20
give them orders heavens army is no
24:23
different I have news to me even though
24:27
there's an army that army cannot leave
24:30
their bitters in heaven attack whoever
24:32
they feel like that's not going to
24:35
happen they have to have orders they
24:38
operate by orders they harpin under the
24:40
word of the lord so that means you're
24:42
not going to move this army unless he
24:45
lives in you and he operates through you
24:49
they're gonna listen to anybody else but
24:54
there had to come a time on this earth
24:56
in order for them to fulfill their
24:58
destiny that we could send them on
25:00
missions ourselves are we joint heirs
25:05
with Christ was he the Lord of Hosts did
25:09
he command heavens army is that our
25:11
right then why aren't we doing it well I
25:15
know you are now but every time I
25:20
introduce the army of heaven I always
25:23
have to go through this preparation for
25:25
people that never considered in their
25:27
head they know what praying to Jesus
25:30
they ask Jesus to send help but if we're
25:35
like them and they create we can create
25:40
if they come in weak in command is that
25:43
right it is always his power that does
25:48
it
25:48
we don't do anything without Christ we
25:51
don't get anything we can't have
25:53
anything we can't just choose to do
25:55
stuff on our own even in the same way we
25:58
don't operate without Christ that army
26:01
cannot operate without commanders back
26:06
in 2014 I was shown millions of the army
26:11
of heaven being sent to this earth and
26:14
they were waiting 2014 the father
26:20
introduced me to the army of heaven and
26:22
taught me how to command them
26:25
from that day I have not ever been
26:28
attacked
26:29
I am never sick they were made to keep
26:38
us and protect us in all our ways the
26:43
Angels we have with us all the time
26:44
they're sent at the time of our
26:46
conception at the time we are conceived
26:49
they are sent I see them all the time
26:52
waiting outside pregnant mothers those
26:56
angels I know where hers are those
26:59
angels that are waiting you're waiting
27:00
for that baby to be born that's when you
27:04
have guardian angels they don't just
27:07
come to you and get a certain age
27:08
they're there with you your entire life
27:11
they have already got their orders from
27:15
the Father they know boundaries that
27:18
they have they know what they were sent
27:20
there for the army has another purpose
27:25
they are sent to attack and destroy the
27:28
plans of the dark armies Satan has an
27:32
army too it's not as big it's not as
27:35
well organized it does not love each
27:37
other they hate each other they kind of
27:42
do what they wanted they get punished a
27:43
lot but God's army cares about each
27:46
other they work well together they are
27:51
fierce against the darkness they don't
27:54
ever abandon their post they're very
27:57
destructive they operate in the spirit
28:00
realm wherever you send them wherever
28:03
there is darkness whether it was evil
28:05
wherever there is violence you can send
28:08
them there this earth is going to change
28:11
drastically when the body of Christ
28:14
finally stops fighting it arguing with
28:16
it not wanting to do anything with it
28:19
because they're afraid their lives are
28:22
going to change especially in this time
28:26
on the earth when God is boldly gonna
28:29
have a step forth and start doing things
28:31
okay and going places where they never
28:33
wanted to go before you send the army
28:35
before you
28:37
all the strongholds are pulled down and
28:40
we just had friends that just witnessed
28:43
that I kept telling them they go on
28:45
these missions trips all over Korea and
28:47
the last time all the reporter was how
28:49
many times they got attacked how many
28:51
people were put in hospitals the own
28:52
people in the hospital how many places
28:54
they got rejected in places already
28:56
agreed to have them come and I said when
28:58
they were done but you did send the army
29:00
right
29:02
we forgot so when they went this year
29:07
they sent me a text we have sent our
29:11
army every one of us we are given them
29:14
very specific detailed orders and every
29:17
place we go they'll go there first
29:19
they'll be there while we're there we
29:21
don't expect a no holdups delays
29:23
incidents accident sicknesses nothing of
29:26
any kind happen every time they went to
29:28
I forgot how many like 2030 cities they
29:30
went to Korea I got a report every time
29:32
every single time they were going to
29:34
know that they know they sent the army
29:36
not one incident not in their travel not
29:42
in their protection not in the places
29:44
they stayed in not the cities they went
29:46
to there were so many miracles and souls
29:49
one and the joy of it all they had any
29:53
interference from the devil not one not
29:58
one not one they want me to come back
30:01
right away
30:03
so that I can again teach and train
30:07
their entire congregation how to command
30:10
their own army from heaven that will
30:12
live over your home in the sky they do
30:17
not go back to heaven they are assigned
30:19
by heaven to you people walk down my
30:23
street look over my home all the time
30:25
they can see beings there all the time
30:27
don't look for somebody that looks like
30:30
you those are Gabriel's group Gabriel's
30:35
group look like humans except they have
30:38
wings sometimes they hide them there on
30:39
a Centon assignment on the earth could
30:41
get easily move around amongst us the
30:44
hosts of heaven would not be able to do
30:47
that someone have six-inch
30:50
years coming out of every pore of their
30:51
being some are the weapon themselves
30:54
they have 18 eyes okay they're made out
30:57
of every kind of form of substance you
30:59
can think of they could not easily move
31:01
amongst us people would call them aliens
31:05
and probably have in the past they're
31:08
creatures almost every one of them are
31:10
creatures creatures are in heaven
31:13
they're ones that look like what we call
31:15
part human part animal the living
31:19
creatures don't get freaked out I'll
31:21
give you proof the living creatures
31:23
around the throne do not look like
31:25
humans they have massive heads that are
31:29
curved like this I know when people say
31:32
they've seen them because that's what
31:34
their heads are shaped like the one like
31:36
a lion the one like an eagle the one
31:39
like an ox the one that has the face of
31:41
a man does not look like Jesus Christ
31:43
because you have wonder they have eyes
31:45
in their heads in the back of their
31:47
heads and every one of their six wings
31:49
they have hooves golden hooves for their
31:52
feet they walk upright they have these
31:54
gossamer gowns on that make a
31:57
frequencies and they're about 80 to 100
32:03
foot tall every one of them are fierce
32:10
don't go up to heaven try to make
32:11
friends with them and the two that hold
32:17
up the arms of the throne are even more
32:19
weird
32:20
they each have four heads they would not
32:23
easily mix with people on the earth God
32:29
has planned every design of every being
32:34
he has ever made including you
32:38
he knew what your face would look like
32:40
before he made you before you were on
32:43
the earth you got your body in heaven
32:46
you were a little spiritual being some
32:48
different sizes about this biggest
32:50
different sizes you are made out of
32:53
light you lived in him you moved in and
32:56
out of him on the Rays of his rainbow
32:59
that was the only place they could go
33:01
move in and out
33:02
they played inside
33:03
they played in the River of Life that's
33:05
where you were that's where you came
33:07
from that's why he is your father that's
33:12
why you are his sons and daughters you
33:14
are says you are his offspring so anyone
33:17
reunion if you have children let me see
33:19
your hands are your children your
33:22
offspring did the mother carry those
33:27
offspring yes
33:29
so she nurtured them right she carried
33:31
them she had water in her womb so they
33:35
would feel like it was a familiar place
33:38
because inside the father is the river
33:40
of life we played in it we moved in it
33:44
that's where you lived you lived in the
33:47
river of life you played on the stones
33:49
of fire that's why we like sparkly
33:52
things the stone sapphire huge gemstones
33:55
inside the father you've jumped on them
33:59
you played on them you slid down this
34:02
mountain this powerful mountain that is
34:05
inside the father you'd slide down the
34:09
river of life you jump off the gem
34:12
stones into the river of life and that's
34:14
where you played so when you made the
34:16
womb of a woman he put water in it so
34:20
while you were growing inside you
34:23
wouldn't be afraid
34:29
we couldn't leave his presence and live
34:32
somewhere in heaven you have not lived
34:34
on the earth before some people believe
34:37
all kinds of crazy things you didn't
34:40
come to the earth until he sent you here
34:42
he knit you together in your mother's
34:43
womb when he took that little spirit of
34:45
life from himself sent it by the Holy
34:47
Spirit at the time of conception he knit
34:49
it and attached it to that dot of flesh
34:52
that is when life begins he sent you
34:56
from himself he made this whole earth
34:59
this physical realm just so he could
35:02
send you here and you could have a body
35:06
that's how well he plans he knows every
35:10
day of your life he planned good things
35:13
for you not the bad there's the evil
35:16
being here named Satan some people think
35:19
even he does not excuse me I've been to
35:22
hell and I've seen him he hates
35:25
everybody but himself his plan is to
35:28
wipe you out every way he can anytime
35:30
you can and right now powerful powerful
35:35
children are being sent to this earth
35:38
for the years that are starting on this
35:40
earth some of the greatest leaders in
35:44
the body of Christ they're still being
35:46
born he needed him here now so he timed
35:51
your birth on the earth you are
35:57
wonderfully and perfectly made you carry
36:00
parts of his image outside and inside
36:03
how did I get all this information
36:05
because I've been caught up to heaven
36:08
non-stop since 1996 I didn't ask for
36:13
that I don't I don't know how to tell
36:16
you to get that Commission I was given
36:18
the Commission
36:19
I don't decide when I go how long I Stay
36:22
I don't decide what I go see he does I
36:27
come from many generations of believers
36:32
who were sold out in love with Jesus
36:35
Christ many of them had encounters with
36:37
him but even the ones that didn't he
36:40
never step back
36:42
and they went forward in their life they
36:44
touch this earth impacted this earth
36:46
with their life never stopped loving God
36:49
never stopped trusting him never ever
36:51
ever ever
36:52
I'm seventh generation I should be
36:58
different I was not raised normally like
37:03
a lot of people were I knew who God was
37:06
from the time I could before I could
37:08
walk I remember even laying in his hand
37:13
when he was sitting on the throne he was
37:15
talking to me I was about this big like
37:17
this like a little like I was and even
37:21
at that time this I know they say you
37:23
know the sex of the child was determined
37:26
in certain ways down here but let me
37:27
tell you he wrote on your soul what you
37:29
would be because he determined who he
37:33
needed you to be male or female there is
37:37
no other choice on your will on your
37:43
will your will which is one of those
37:47
powerful things you have I'm still not
37:48
starting yet who here does not know but
37:54
human soul looks like we see your hands
37:57
if you don't know literally how it's
37:58
made you know what your mind your will
38:02
and your emotions but do you know what
38:04
those things look like he showed me back
38:10
in 2010 he showed me I have a
38:12
photographic memory which comes in
38:15
really handy with what I do
38:17
cuz I've remembered every single time my
38:19
mistake in heaven he showed me the human
38:22
soul because he's gonna release
38:24
something that would change the body of
38:26
Christ forever and that's exactly what
38:27
he said to me when they learn how to
38:30
really guard their soul they can cause
38:34
it to prosper their self when they get
38:37
their soul to prosper they will always
38:39
prosper and they will live in divine
38:42
health so I am never sick because I
38:47
order my soul accordingly I let no
38:50
darkness in
38:52
I don't watch anything that belongs I
38:54
don't read it I don't watch it and I
38:56
don't say it and I don't listen to it
38:59
either
38:59
it says guard your heart that is your
39:02
soul you know the heart the word heart
39:05
means something more than this thing is
39:06
it on this side I forget this beating
39:10
thing is not what he's talking about
39:12
guard your heart is not about this heart
39:15
it's this one the very core of your
39:18
being in your spirit man is where your
39:20
soul is guard that fraud will flow the
39:25
way you live your life the issues of
39:29
life for out of this soul that you have
39:32
inside you will determine how you live
39:36
your life as a man thinketh in his soul
39:40
so is he so if you don't like you you
39:44
can change it if you don't like things
39:47
happening to you you can change that too
39:49
if you don't like the atmosphere in your
39:51
home you can change that too according
39:55
to what you say what you think how you
39:58
order your life can change your life
40:02
when Adam was laying there not alive and
40:06
God blew the Father the word was with
40:10
him the word was always with him when
40:13
they created that's why you can say
40:15
talking of the word there's nothing that
40:19
was made that was not made by him well
40:22
how come the father was there they
40:23
worked together all the time
40:28
God spoke it the word made it that's how
40:32
it works
40:32
whenever the father said the word that's
40:36
why it was his name would make it they
40:40
were always together so they were
40:42
together in the garden the word made
40:45
Adam but he was missing something he
40:48
wasn't alive he needed his spirit his
40:53
little spirit man that had lived in God
40:54
all that time kept him knew who he would
40:58
become he leaned over and breathed that
41:02
little spirit man these
41:04
fear of life from inside himself or he
41:07
had been living into Adams nostrils and
41:10
then he said Adam has become a living
41:13
soul that's very important that was now
41:19
saying because we had souls wanted
41:21
living in God we just didn't really need
41:22
them because your soul you decide where
41:25
you're gonna live what you're gonna say
41:27
what you're gonna wear what you're gonna
41:28
eat we didn't have to decide any of that
41:30
when we lived him he was our home
41:32
he was our very existence so he gave us
41:35
something to wear right he nurtured us
41:38
he's called the many breasted one he
41:40
took care of us the whole time we were
41:43
with him it says that in the Bible that
41:44
just meant that he would comfort us he
41:46
would hold us he would love us it does
41:49
say that in the Bible depending on
41:51
translation you get some of the newer
41:53
ones I don't know what for if it says
41:55
that or not but it does say that about
41:58
him no matter how your father your
42:01
physical one treated you on this earth
42:04
he is your real father so your soul is
42:11
very key to your very existence most of
42:14
the time I grew up in church think I was
42:16
born there practically we went every
42:18
meeting we had in the churches that we
42:20
attended and and I learned a lot I
42:23
listened a lot I learned a lot but they
42:26
never really told me what my soul was
42:28
for except that it was not good
42:33
almost every statement made it's dark
42:35
man designs and desires bad things and
42:39
things and bad things and well maybe if
42:41
they choose that they do you know to a
42:43
five-year-old don't know how darker
42:45
could be and I would sit there on that
42:47
pew and this is what I would think how
42:49
could they say that I meet from God I'm
42:54
light I carry light how can my soul be
42:57
bad they just don't know something they
43:01
just don't know this is at five I would
43:05
think about those things my soul has to
43:07
be good Jesus lives in it cuz I got born
43:10
again 84 well no my souls not bad my
43:15
cell no I think on the things of God No
43:18
mine is not we need to find out why our
43:20
solace for it's got to be important he
43:23
didn't make spare parts and if they say
43:27
it's my mind my will and my emotions
43:28
that pretty much I could do nothing
43:29
without it so he decided to literally
43:33
show me and in 2010 he caught me up to
43:35
heaven show me this is a human soul and
43:38
the very core of your being is your will
43:41
it looks like a column it is a column
43:44
it's a strong column with writings on it
43:47
that God Himself wrote on before he sent
43:51
you here he wrote things on it
43:53
no man can literally say and mean it
43:55
that there is no God they lie or they
43:59
don't know but they cannot say that or
44:01
even really convince yourself even
44:03
atheists when they get saved say I
44:05
always knew there was something he wrote
44:07
on your will and then attached to that
44:12
will is your mind not your human brain
44:16
your human brain is just kind of wrapped
44:18
around that mind because when you die
44:20
you still think when you step out of
44:23
that physical body and you're in your
44:24
spirit body
44:25
you think you have emotions you make
44:28
choices
44:29
you'd be pretty bored in heaven if you
44:31
couldn't your soul goes with you your
44:35
body gets separated your soul stays with
44:36
your spirit man you have your favorite
44:39
places in heaven you have your favorite
44:40
foods in heaven so that soul stays with
44:44
you all the time it just fed all day
44:48
long your physical body gets fed three
44:51
times day unless you like to snack a lot
44:54
in foreign countries eat twice a day
44:56
America its three times with dessert and
45:00
snacks but your spirit man your soul is
45:08
sped all day long and if you play stuff
45:12
at night it's fed at night what are you
45:16
feeding you everything you see
45:18
everything you hear everything you read
45:22
and what you say yourself you feed other
45:27
people's souls when you say certain
45:29
things your
45:31
into them I'm I'm feeding you
45:32
everybody's soul right now your soul is
45:34
taking it in you have layers in your
45:37
soul it gets stored in there if there's
45:40
ever anything you really forgot you need
45:42
to remember just tell God that I need my
45:44
soul I need to know from the files of my
45:46
soul I need that I need that I said it
45:49
till one time and in front of me sitting
45:52
in my desk I needed a little scrap of
45:53
paper pastor had written his name and
45:55
phone number down he was gonna invite me
45:57
to come and I lost it but I looked at it
46:00
first I had read it looked at it read I
46:02
knew the same shape and size of that
46:04
piece of paper and it was stored in my
46:06
soul this was like 2 years later when I
46:08
can't find it I need it I know they want
46:11
me to comment on one thing I'm ignoring
46:12
them and when I said ok see my soul show
46:14
it to me in front of me came this piece
46:18
of paper out in the spirit it literally
46:23
it literally just like this came out
46:25
like this and I could see it it was the
46:27
same piece of paper I had looked at
46:29
because it's stored in you and he said
46:34
write it down cleric it's gonna go back
46:36
in there so get my pen I am writing as
46:39
fast as I can I was so excited it didn't
46:42
go like this flip flip now that is
46:49
wonderful if it's something good but if
46:54
you have horrible traumas that is also
46:57
stored in your soul people get tormented
47:00
for years about the things they had to
47:02
witness or see it wasn't even anything
47:03
they had to do with you don't have to
47:05
keep it anything in your soul you don't
47:09
want you loose it with the keys to the
47:11
community you know what that says write
47:17
the keys of the kingdom what you loose
47:20
on earth does that mean you're going to
47:22
keep it if you loose it nope and we
47:25
always thought the keys at the kingdom
47:26
wants to bind the devil they do a lot of
47:30
things actually but what I was taught
47:32
for the father that day was how to get
47:34
stuff out of your soul whether it was
47:37
addictions any kind of addiction trauma
47:40
violent acts words that were said
47:43
that you don't wanna remember those
47:44
words they hurt they wound wounds out of
47:47
your soul it doesn't matter what it is
47:49
witchcraft practice against you it's
47:51
gone gone gone angry hateful words
47:54
offense and forgetting us gone God said
47:57
I don't have six months for people I
48:00
don't have six months for them to be
48:03
healed anymore
48:05
you can lose spirits of infirmity
48:07
sickness and disease from your soul and
48:12
it's gone and I just happened to glance
48:18
in my clock and then he caught me up to
48:19
heaven
48:20
and he showed me the human soul then he
48:22
started telling me one thing after
48:23
another for another they can lose Cistus
48:25
this assists this this this all this
48:27
stuff all this stuff all this stuff they
48:29
can choose to loose it and it we can't
48:31
take it out remember it's loosed from
48:36
heaven then you bind the things of God
48:39
to your soul and this really changes how
48:42
you live you think and you act you can
48:46
actually say and now I choose with my
48:49
will to bind to my soul the life of God
48:52
the love of God the presence of God the
48:54
plans and purposes of God from my life
48:57
his creativity his celebration his
49:00
expectation you get so filled with God
49:06
and no one can take it out it's part of
49:14
that abundant life and it doesn't matter
49:17
how old you are it doesn't matter how
49:19
long ago you experienced things you can
49:24
even lose things from your children
49:26
Souls if they're not adults yet we've
49:29
already had testimonies there's people
49:31
being in the congregations you lay your
49:33
hand on their head as the covering of
49:36
their soul I chooses my will to lose
49:39
from my child so every bit of the
49:40
bullying that they Oaks means all the
49:42
hateful mean disgusting vile
49:46
critical words spoken over my child I
49:49
choose to lose them from their soul
49:51
right now
49:52
haven't come down pulls them out it's
49:54
like it never happened and kids go on
49:59
happy like it never happened
50:01
instead of being affected sometimes for
50:04
a very long time like if you try out for
50:08
something and you reject it sometimes it
50:10
hurts children just loose it
50:11
we have kids are doing on their own we
50:15
have 10 year olds that command armies up
50:17
from heaven because they didn't argue
50:20
about doing it those 10 year olds are
50:23
certainly not worshiping their
50:26
commanding what do they do
50:29
they command them to go to their school
50:30
and protect every student there to stop
50:33
all violence from coming into their zoo
50:35
to pull down strongholds of Satan rising
50:37
against the school too potent on
50:38
strongholds trying to convince them that
50:40
there's something different than they
50:42
are you choose that's why he gave you a
50:52
will that's why he will not control
50:55
people
50:56
Satan controls he'll be happy to take
51:00
your will and do whatever he wants to
51:03
with it and if you put enough of him in
51:05
it you're gonna act like him is that
51:07
right you choose with yourself who are
51:11
you going to serve you choose each day
51:14
am I going to choose life or death
51:16
there's a lot of that going on in this
51:17
election and a lot of people are
51:21
choosing death that's not God God wants
51:28
us to live and live more abundantly amen
51:30
tomorrow night I'll be talking about
51:32
America and Trump 2020
51:35
[Music]
51:35
[Applause]
51:37
but God has told me I think he knows
51:42
amen he on purpose has chosen America to
51:50
be a pattern that even other government
51:54
leaders of other countries can choose to
51:56
pattern their ways after America I
52:01
remember I travel a whole lot in 2017
52:05
and I would meet up people from all over
52:07
the world I never knew never met them
52:09
they'd all come up to me and say you
52:10
must be an American you have pink hair
52:13
we don't have that here but we want to
52:17
know what do you think about your
52:18
president because what we've been
52:20
hearing on the news we cannot possibly
52:22
believe it could be true but he's
52:25
already visited our country and
52:27
encouraged our leaders we already know
52:29
that business is booming in America we
52:32
know he's creating jobs for that country
52:34
we hope our leader becomes just like him
52:38
but we want to know what do you think I
52:40
said well I think 80% of America loves
52:42
him that's why they voted him in and by
52:45
the way stop watching CNN
52:47
I think the fake news doesn't like us
52:51
either and I'd have these long
52:57
discussions with these people never knew
52:58
and these were like medical doctors I
53:00
mean really leaders in their own
53:03
community and it probably did from eight
53:05
different countries and they all asked
53:08
me the same thing and they got the same
53:11
answer so God still has big plans for
53:16
America you think he's wrapping things
53:17
up in ten years I don't think so we are
53:20
just learning to operate and levels of
53:25
authority that were given to us by Jesus
53:27
Christ we're just learning to really
53:30
take authority over the weather because
53:32
we're over it not under it if we're just
53:37
learning this why would you wrap
53:38
everything up this is what God says I
53:42
will not have a weak pathetic testimony
53:45
of my son's death
53:49
and all he gave you I'm not taking
53:51
anybody anywhere until they're operating
53:54
like him so why do we do all this
54:00
everything we do we do because of him we
54:05
do it with him because of him and for
54:08
him we're light in this world so if you
54:12
wonder who to vote for someone who
54:14
doesn't represent the darkness that does
54:16
not represent death that cares about
54:19
what's going on in this world or
54:22
especially their country and God
54:25
certainly cares about it he cares about
54:27
everyone but but we were willing the
54:32
body of Christ is willing to help God is
54:35
that right they worshiped him they loved
54:38
him they honor him what he wants they're
54:41
willing to do the majority are willing
54:43
they just don't know what to do some of
54:44
them and since before pastors weren't
54:48
allowed to give any help now they are of
54:51
course you did design the Internet that
54:54
bypasses everything so God has great
55:00
plans and the next thing I'm going to
55:03
show you is really the first time on
55:05
planet Earth this has ever been done and
55:09
the father said I'm going to ask you to
55:10
do something I want it done right away
55:11
he said I'm going to mark the year that
55:15
I released for the first time the faces
55:18
of the hosts of heaven to humanity he
55:23
said I want you to put them in a
55:24
calendar you're gonna call it the hosts
55:26
undercover he said they'd better
55:30
undercover for a long time but now they
55:32
won't be because he's serious about
55:35
crushing hell he does have he has a
55:38
defined time when time will be no more
55:41
if you want to know what that means I
55:42
can tell you that means there'll be no
55:45
more time to count days and there were
55:49
no limit to space like in heaven there
55:52
can be 10 things right here there's
55:55
layers in heaven so the comet on many
55:59
earths when time will be no more he will
56:01
not need this physical
56:03
and even when that happens it won't be a
56:06
date it will be an event because God
56:08
counts things by events the time just
56:12
happens to fall in every time he does
56:15
something he does it because of an event
56:18
so on his timeline he measures his
56:20
timeline by events that's how he does it
56:25
so there'll be a certain event at one
56:27
point when that happens he won't need
56:29
this earth anymore there will be a new
56:32
earth made the Bible talks about it some
56:34
people don't want to even admit that day
56:36
I don't know what this thing is are
56:37
afraid to leave it I guess seriously
56:41
there are whole groups now saying there
56:43
is we'll just be remade or keeping it I
56:45
don't think that's scriptural there
56:49
isn't any
56:51
they just think he's gonna make it all
56:53
better
56:54
it wouldn't be able to hold what he's
56:57
got playing for us in the new earth
56:59
you couldn't have put it the new earth
57:03
will be so huge the very fact that the
57:07
New Jerusalem will sit on that the earth
57:08
this earth would go whoop just put this
57:12
in just with the New Jerusalem honor
57:13
okay what's that that's God's transport
57:16
down to the new work that's what it is
57:18
he's packing up leaving his own home
57:22
he's always had leaving heaven one day
57:25
because we will stay in his home for a
57:28
temporary time when you die and move to
57:31
heaven that your RNR you get a beautiful
57:34
mansion you get to do things you never
57:36
thought of before it's R&R for that
57:38
place because God intends fully at one
57:42
time when time as know where he's gonna
57:45
take all of us and it by belonging to
57:47
him that we are his put us on a brand
57:49
new earth and he will pack up his bags
57:51
get on the New Jerusalem and it will be
57:53
his transport we will be down here
57:55
waiting on the new earth for him we will
57:57
see him coming these are real things
58:02
that are talked about in the Word of God
58:04
but people are so stuck where they're at
58:07
they don't know how much further they
58:08
can go so they don't really know where
58:10
they are so they go to what they know
58:13
they all talk about the tribulation they
58:15
talk about the Rabb
58:16
they don't know they talk about doom and
58:18
gloom because you know the tribulation
58:20
is doom and gloom right heaven isn't
58:25
heaven doesn't give you a funeral
58:28
somebody please have a party when their
58:30
loved ones go home because that's what
58:33
they're having in heaven they don't get
58:36
a funeral in heaven they get a party
58:38
it's called a celebration the Bible says
58:42
he celebrates every time one comes home
58:44
that is a celebration that's a lot
58:47
different than the funeral it's a
58:51
funeral would fun after you end so I'm
58:57
going to show you this we have some back
58:59
there I don't know how many we have but
59:01
we're going to give this one to Dave and
59:02
Dee Dee so they'll make sure they get
59:04
one he had us create this it was
59:06
definitely a supernatural thing because
59:08
I have about 400 pictures of the hosts
59:12
he actually sent them to me to get
59:14
pictures of them it if there were a lot
59:16
of them I took pictures if this is the
59:18
thing if you didn't want them shown they
59:20
they collapsed the picture did it was
59:23
like no definition that's just a flat
59:26
nothing and I began I said well what's
59:29
wrong with this one he said no I don't
59:31
want you to keep that one I'll get
59:32
another one so perfectly sharp and clear
59:34
he said you're gonna keep that one I
59:35
didn't know it was keeping them to make
59:37
this calendar we're gonna put them on a
59:39
lot of other things cuz they will
59:40
inspire you and empower you to know
59:42
these guys are real and their greatest
59:47
passion is to war against the darkness
59:50
they didn't cry when Lucifer was kicked
59:52
out the day Michael cried Gabriel
59:58
Michael didn't try they had a party
60:00
because they were fed up with Lucifer
60:03
going around tempting their own friends
60:06
to fall picture in your town and how did
60:13
God deal with evil he kicked it out he
60:16
didn't tolerate it he didn't make a
60:19
place for it he didn't say it's okay
60:24
you're different he kicked it out he
60:27
didn't want it there he didn't want to
60:29
filing heaven anymore it will never be
60:32
allowed back he is not going to forgive
60:35
Satan and he is not going to forgive one
60:39
fallen angel they live with him they got
60:43
one chance it's up soz about these guys
60:49
in the unit on the front cover is a
60:52
being I know I didn't not like this one
60:54
on purpose sometimes we outlined them to
60:56
help you in the corner we would show a
60:59
being like this one then down here we
61:01
just outlined it in case you couldn't
61:03
tell because spiritual beings are made
61:06
different the army especially they don't
61:08
have a hand like this all of them don't
61:10
some have a head they have more than one
61:11
eye or they have one big eye
61:13
guess what else I cops thing came from
61:17
the enemy will take anything you can
61:19
that balloons of God and twist it and
61:21
defile it he will now Medusa that was
61:24
his own creation but there's a lot of
61:29
beings in heaven there's many beings
61:32
that have like a horse body and
61:34
beautiful you know there's them is very
61:36
beautiful they're not evil Satan took
61:40
the image and made it evil so I'm gonna
61:42
show you a couple of the pages now this
61:44
one's very easily seen this is a real
61:46
fire angel made out of guess what fire
61:49
and he's a spirit she she's all
61:52
spiritual being his arms don't come from
61:56
his shoulders they come from his chest
61:59
this is his arm this is his whole arm
62:02
coming out of his body this is his head
62:04
if you could look at this closer you
62:06
could see his eyes his nose his mouth
62:08
this is his wings right here his hair
62:10
his wings he is walking on legs do you
62:14
see the legs he's walking on the river
62:17
in our city and in his hand he's
62:20
carrying a deposit of the fire of God
62:22
his name is Inferno and gentes picture
62:27
it was right after our National Day of
62:30
Prayer and all the wild intercessors got
62:33
on a riverboat we wrote up a nun our st.
62:35
Johns River and we would drop salt in
62:37
the water salting it and we said on
62:39
purpose this is to make way
62:42
to cleanse the water for the fire of God
62:44
to come and then God sent it so about a
62:48
month later after that event he showed
62:51
up on the river we were going over to
62:53
visit my sister on the other side of the
62:55
river and he said don't go the way you
62:57
normally go go this other way or you're
62:59
gonna miss what I'm gonna send in the
63:00
sky she's a photographer I'm driving I
63:04
have to say Jen took this picture I took
63:07
a lot of them but she did take this one
63:08
and we were we are miles dropped off
63:10
when we came over we were on the Express
63:12
system we came over this part down under
63:15
where this is this bridge is three miles
63:17
long as a three mile long bridge that
63:20
connects to the other side of our city
63:22
he was walking on the water not not
63:25
standing he was we got about eight
63:29
pictures of him and he was kind of white
63:30
then he started getting more and more
63:32
fire in him and people were going crazy
63:35
they were pulling over I mean many
63:36
pictures got this people got this
63:38
picture so this is this was one of not
63:40
the very first one but one of the best
63:42
that was in 2009 and so I'll show you
63:46
another one we'll have them back there
63:51
now these are all army members these are
63:53
not any of gabriel's I don't have any
63:56
pictures of Gabriel's I've drawn them I
63:58
painted them I don't have any pictures
64:00
god I'm purpose connecting me to the
64:02
army and so I'll show you another one
64:05
just kind of passing around here some of
64:07
them if you ever see something the sky
64:09
looks like a dragon it's an Eragon they
64:11
belong to heaven if God told me their
64:16
name I know what their name is this one
64:17
right here is there's a whole group
64:20
there angels are made in tribes both on
64:22
Gabriel side the first tribes were hid
64:25
in heaven they weren't angels he made
64:27
them in tribes because they had a
64:29
defined purpose every tribe had a
64:31
defined purpose and this one is the
64:33
guardian angel over the state of New
64:35
York
64:36
his name is Excalibur can you see his
64:40
face very clearly in the back can you
64:45
see it oh thank you yeah he looks like a
64:50
lion
64:52
you see his mouth up and you can see his
64:55
Mane yeah he's part of the tribe of the
65:00
Royal Guard they all look like lions
65:03
you've seen a lot of lines in the sky it
65:05
was these guys right here and they do
65:09
look like they look like lions and they
65:11
guard the Royals because you are kings
65:14
and priests into your God so that is
65:18
their defying purpose they come to guard
65:20
those who will rule and reign with
65:22
Christ so that's that's the Royal Guard
65:25
I also have ones that transport troops
65:28
from heaven at pictures of the troops of
65:31
heaven have pictures of one that goes
65:33
into as covert and he he videotapes the
65:38
actions of darkness and he goes right up
65:41
to Michael's throne Michaels building he
65:44
has one eye okay this is this is that
65:48
angel its name is scout because he's a
65:50
scout he goes behind the lines you
65:54
should be able to see the one big eye
65:56
it's right here you see a mark on that
65:59
angel see that mark next to his eye it's
66:05
a mark like a tattoo God marks the enemy
66:09
stole it
66:10
that's God's thing he marks them with
66:12
different marks and this one right here
66:14
is literally going like this looking and
66:19
watching activities of Hell's army who
66:21
are clueless to what they're doing they
66:24
are absolutely clueless and so he's
66:28
standing in a cloud in his wings or
66:30
other army members of the hosts to
66:32
protect them from any attacks of the
66:34
enemy and so God has really good plans
66:36
so this is a scout host of hosts of
66:39
heaven with one eye right here if you
66:42
could see a close you could literally
66:43
see a face on the eye it records and
66:49
this is something he asked us to create
66:52
we didn't choose to do it ourselves I'm
66:55
gonna show you another one
66:57
oh we actually entry on here like here a
67:01
roll up your Raptor rug and roll up
67:03
you're out for rock and
67:05
in here we have things like don't forget
67:08
to ask for grace for today and then we
67:11
have special days we put a special days
67:14
in here we don't have Halloween so sorry
67:17
we took it out we took liberties we
67:29
don't have holidays from other false
67:30
religions either so get used to it and
67:34
so then we put statements at the bottom
67:36
each the Holy Spirit gave us you must
67:38
choose to be chosen you know that thing
67:41
God many are called but few are chosen
67:44
is because they didn't choose to be
67:46
chosen you choose it you choose to be
67:49
chosen this one is one of the best ones
67:51
we have his name is Rex yeah it's it's
68:00
me do you see his face he looks like a
68:03
lion he's high up in the command of the
68:08
Royal Guard really high up he's got
68:11
wings that come from his neck my
68:14
son-in-law likes to say he has horns and
68:16
I want one no he didn't really have
68:17
horns those are wings and I can't do
68:21
this as well so my turn around this is
68:23
one wing and this is another one and
68:25
there's eyes lining there's eyes in all
68:27
these wings eyes he has the eye on the
68:29
end of his beard
68:31
this is his moustache can you see his
68:33
moustache it's long isn't that people
68:37
say do angels have beards and mustaches
68:39
the answer is yes you can see them right
68:40
here he's holding a scroll on his hand
68:46
can you see the scroll this is the
68:49
scroll has a face it's a living scroll
68:53
his name is Justus that scroll was
69:01
dropped inside of me I had to say yes
69:04
because I was said during the time when
69:08
when we would command and the scrolls
69:11
name is Justus and God said that he
69:12
would read himself to me
69:15
would that bother you've got to ask you
69:18
that
69:18
what would you say that's well I
69:21
actually had to say yes my husband was
69:24
with me somebody who never sees angels
69:26
he's got five layers of a soul he's
69:28
Scottish he's like a mountain he can't
69:31
be moved anywhere he just belong to
69:33
Jesus but he was with me when this beam
69:35
came in over five storeys of condos and
69:37
when spiritual beings come in the
69:39
physical realm they flatten they come in
69:42
and then they open up we have pictures
69:44
of him flattened coming in we had
69:48
pictures of him fully open we have
69:50
pictures of him just waiting and then I
69:53
asked the Holy after I got nuns
69:55
screaming and yelling my husband's like
69:57
oh something's coming in that was his
70:00
whole statement something's coming in
70:02
I'm like I'm excited I'm so excited
70:06
wonder what he's here for a wonder what
70:08
he wants and so I saw the spirit what is
70:10
he here for was he's got orders from
70:12
headquarters during the army from heaven
70:15
for you to command and I said what I do
70:18
he says you have to say I receive the
70:20
scroll so I said I received it he
70:22
dropped it and went inside of me and I
70:25
said well whatever do he said nothing
70:26
it'll read itself to you scrolls in
70:30
heaven books in heaven read themselves
70:32
to you so this is normal for heaven this
70:36
is what happens when you live
70:37
supernatural this is what happens when
70:39
you choose to live the way God designed
70:40
you to be amen and so we have heard him
70:45
say one word and there's another picture
70:48
after this I don't have that with me but
70:51
after he dropped the scroll out of this
70:53
this rift this deep blue is heaven right
70:57
there that's heaven and when I said yes
70:59
and you dropped inside of me out of
71:01
these came two more beings one had a
71:03
shofar one had a trumpet they began to
71:06
blow them because God was signifying
71:08
something the earth was going to command
71:11
the army and so that's what that
71:15
signified if I had said no it might have
71:18
changed things or he would have found
71:20
someone else I wasn't willing to do that
71:22
amen so I have that picture you
71:24
literally see these
71:25
beings one looks very ancient he's got a
71:27
long beard his eyes a rectangle and he's
71:30
got a shofar the other one has a trumpet
71:33
trumpet he's just got like a big like a
71:36
I can't remem what you call those things
71:39
capes or woods whatever you want to call
71:41
that he had something like that and they
71:43
were there celebrating then they were
71:44
gone like that so we had a very little
71:47
time I said I'm taking pictures I don't
71:49
know about you I'm taking pictures to
71:50
get some pictures of it so this is
71:52
what's in this calendar and every month
71:55
it has something to encourage you and
71:58
the hosts make toast may the hosts go
72:02
with you we say that to people all the
72:03
time stand up stand out be dangerous
72:05
against hell but this is not your normal
72:08
calendar okay and over here what we know
72:13
about that being we will tell you if we
72:15
know something about it right there will
72:17
tell you and and on the back he had us
72:20
actually we couldn't hide who we are I
72:22
said you're gonna show who you are so
72:24
this is about a company one quest
72:26
international tells you what it is
72:28
there's me there's Margaret and then we
72:31
have another page you said you're also
72:32
going to show the creative team I sent
72:34
all this through so people know who
72:36
helped to create it because I don't do
72:37
everything by myself
72:38
there I am there's our our very funny
72:44
English guy there's Jan okay in about
72:48
two weeks we had it done do you ever
72:52
work in any kind of marketing or
72:54
creating that's that's definitely that's
72:57
a heaven thing we stayed up we traveled
73:00
we worked on it in the hotel room the
73:02
hardest part was was picking out we just
73:04
put all these pictures out everywhere we
73:06
took them with us and then and God gave
73:09
us what to say push back darkness I mean
73:10
this whole thing is about God it's all
73:13
about heaven it's about God's time on
73:14
the earth and there's a there's others
73:18
so there's one for each month in here
73:19
and people go what the years have to
73:21
over yet but they're not done this is
73:24
about a time it's about a time like God
73:28
counts event by events this is an event
73:31
that God had picked scrolls were
73:34
literally open and heaven unlocked and
73:37
open
73:38
so the host could work with us to
73:40
fulfill their destiny that they were
73:42
created to war for us so that's my
73:45
introduction and we will have some back
73:50
there if we if we know the name some
73:54
look pretty fierce but these guys war
73:57
you think about they war just like a
74:00
military they're warring for you they
74:02
fight for you literally for you for your
74:05
family they'll keep the darkness as long
74:08
as you're not bringing in your home
74:09
they'll keep it out of your home amen
74:11
and so these are some of our products
74:13
our cups this is just our book cover of
74:16
book 1 that's what that is and
74:18
eventually we'll have whole sets of cups
74:21
made like with some of the hosts on them
74:23
that you can get you can go to revealing
74:31
heaven dot-com and they'll all be on all
74:33
those will be online
74:37
yeah our phone numbers on our website
74:40
you can call it if you can't find
74:41
something you can call it and so um yeah
74:44
our events are planned for specific
74:46
purposes that we have our own there to
74:48
train people to be prepared to be a part
74:50
of a move of God like we have for the
74:52
first time we're going to be training
74:53
whether Warriors at our event at the end
74:55
this next weekend actually it's called
74:58
heavens invitation and we've had every
75:01
year since we've been going and now
75:03
we're adding weather warriors as one of
75:05
the whole days to be trained how do you
75:07
train how you learn too because you know
75:10
Jesus already knew all that when he was
75:12
asleep in the boat he already knew he
75:14
could do that he was hoping the
75:17
disciples would learned from him and yet
75:19
what did they do there they're in terror
75:22
for their own life there's a lord of
75:23
glory on the boat with him and he's
75:25
sleeping I'm sure you wanted to say why
75:29
didn't you handle it when he learned to
75:32
multiply the food he was training them
75:33
the whole time why didn't you multiply
75:35
food we can go and buy it we can't fine
75:37
well why didn't you multiply it
75:39
I mean disciples he wanted them to learn
75:42
what he did why don't you traveling
75:44
through the spirit realm will fill up
75:45
God it
75:47
Philip did as a lifestyle it was so
75:49
normal for him he just did it you don't
75:53
try it you do only purpose and focus and
75:57
you keep doing it and something is going
76:00
to happen and he doesn't care if you're
76:04
ninety nine or nine it's what you choose
76:07
what you decide you want but wherever
76:10
you don't don't reject it
76:13
sometimes it's Jesus just taught them
76:16
something he didn't say what do you want
76:17
this or not he just did it it's up to
76:21
you if you do it or not amen
76:23
and this new time we're living in the
76:26
earth where we will demonstrate the
76:28
power of the Living God we're not
76:32
waiting on that time we're in that time
76:34
you weren't here the last time I was
76:36
here I just got back from Reno where I
76:38
walked on the air who wants to do that
76:43
be passionate about it
76:46
I didn't even walk on water first I know
76:49
Jesus said the books I did you will do
76:51
and greater works you will do I jumped
76:53
right into the greater works you know
76:56
why that happened because I was
76:57
violently passionate about something I
77:00
had just hit my foot under stone and I
77:04
roared this should not have happened to
77:07
me I will not tolerate this again your
77:09
word says that the angels will catch me
77:11
up so I don't even - my foot on a stone
77:13
I will never do that again
77:15
and so next the week after I'm in Reno
77:17
and between the green room and where we
77:20
were there was a drop-off this big I
77:22
walked right off of it I didn't even
77:25
think I didn't know I was walking in
77:27
here but I had said that and this the
77:29
floor of a stone that was really humor I
77:32
think on their part I said it wouldn't -
77:34
stop and literally I don't know if they
77:37
caught me I don't know what they did I
77:38
don't know what they did I just know I
77:40
didn't hit it I didn't fall on it I
77:42
didn't hit it my foot didn't get dashed
77:44
my head didn't get - it was like so high
77:47
I would have fallen my whole body would
77:48
have been I just walked like it was
77:49
nothing I'm just doing the father's
77:51
business right the pastor's in front of
77:53
me walking and talking and I'm just
77:54
walking and talking behind him and gents
77:56
are shelling you're floating in air
78:00
and what no I'm not I had my iPad or
78:04
holding my iPad and I'm just talking to
78:06
the pastor she says yes you are yes you
78:08
are you know I thought she was playing a
78:10
joke on me or something so I just keep
78:11
walking I'm walking I walked out about 6
78:14
foot she goes you are walking on air why
78:21
don't you look down so I'm walking
78:24
outside I went I threw my iPad and I was
78:29
there for about three more seconds just
78:31
so he knew I would never forget that I
78:33
was walking out here and I just went
78:35
down really slow
78:36
I began shaking Jen we were shaking and
78:40
the pastor owns what just happened
78:41
jingles she was flirting and he's a
78:44
really good friend he said that's
78:45
awesome
78:46
will you do it out in the congregation
78:51
why you just walk off that platform
78:53
sweetie I want you to walk out that
78:54
place son the whole time I'm when I
79:00
first looked down and went wow it was
79:01
this like walking on water and the
79:03
father said oh no Jesus could feel the
79:05
water he knew water was there didn't
79:09
have anything to do but he said he could
79:10
feel the water you couldn't feel the air
79:13
no I couldn't say that's a greater work
79:16
okay and he said well I'll get used to
79:18
it until everybody they better start
79:20
getting used to it everybody say I
79:22
receive it
79:25
this is definitely a different time we
79:28
can't we can't think the same if you
79:31
stay in your old mindset that's where
79:34
you'll be when you either die and go to
79:36
heaven or get raptured if you're gonna
79:37
live for a couple hundred more years
79:38
you'll probably get raptured if not then
79:40
you're probably just going to go there
79:43
and I've been shown a lot in the future
79:46
and we're just starting into something
79:47
so powerful the next 50 years will be so
79:50
powerful on this very powerful I have
79:56
grandchildren that are already being
79:57
caught up to heaven it will be normal
80:00
for children to visit heaven normal
80:02
especially if their parents are
80:04
believers it's gonna be normal he
80:08
describes it all the time things that
80:10
I've seen that I never even told him
80:11
about okay he was three when it started
80:14
rota volcano or the lava of a volcano
80:18
with my father who lives in heaven and
80:20
with Jesus huh
80:25
he'd never met my father he called him
80:28
grandpa but my dad looks 25 and he said
80:32
and he gave me some Mary Janes
80:35
he didn't know where Mary Jane was maybe
80:37
somebody's you don't know either
80:39
my dad's favorite candy in heaven he was
80:43
giving him candy what do grandparents do
80:44
they give candy so they still get to
80:49
heaven he was with him and they were
80:51
gonna ride this volcano and he was
80:53
telling his mom all this and she said
80:54
you better get over here right now get
80:56
over here I said what did you expect
80:57
what's gonna happen
80:58
and so he's telling me all this Indy
81:00
goes you know what and a three year old
81:02
would not know even how a volcano was
81:05
well he said there was lava it was red
81:07
it was like kind of burning like and he
81:09
said you know this mount was really cool
81:11
grandpa took us straight up the side of
81:13
the mountain no wheels on his car we we
81:17
just kind of glided up to the top in the
81:19
mountain we jumped off and went inside
81:21
the volcano he said you know what my mom
81:25
he said that would have burned anybody
81:28
else to death but because of my god
81:33
we didn't burn we wrote on and it was a
81:38
fun ride and he you know what he's seven
81:49
now and it hasn't stopped
81:51
he'll preach to anybody anything he
81:55
talks to his army he asked for grace
81:59
every day and he looses stuff from his
82:01
soul they don't ever have meltdowns in
82:05
their car because as soon as they can
82:07
talk she teaches him how to ask for
82:09
credits this is our life this is this is
82:13
our life this is how we're supposed to
82:15
be living we're not from this world we
82:19
live here worse we'll be acting like the
82:21
world we come from amen so it's already
82:27
starting it's already starting you know
82:31
I have three daughters they see they
82:34
hear I told them they had two and
82:40
they're a girl might you won't sin
82:42
because you don't get a choice I'm not
82:46
letting you guys not letting you he said
82:48
he needed holy seed in this earth and I
82:50
gave up myself to get married and have
82:52
you hi this is their conversation when
82:55
they're little just looking at me I
82:58
expect you to do greater things than I
83:00
do and my grandchildren will be even
83:03
greater so you will have nine children
83:05
[Laughter]
83:07
people don't tell you kiss him it's
83:10
better than the screaming telling
83:11
there'll be nothing in their dumb they
83:14
never thought they were that they never
83:17
thought they were those things and if
83:19
someone told me they said oh no I'm not
83:20
I belong to Jesus Christ
83:24
one day when we had everything we owned
83:26
taken away from us not our fault thrown
83:28
out of our home we packed everything up
83:30
we picked our kids up in a moving van
83:32
and my daughter who is 16 said to me
83:39
what an adventure with God I cannot wait
83:42
to see what is he gonna do with us I am
83:45
so excited
83:46
she's 16 raise him up in the admonition
83:55
of the Lord
83:58
train them up in the gifts that God gave
84:01
them and they'll never depart from those
84:03
gifts the advance had never stopped they
84:08
never ran in the world I'm serious never
84:10
ran in the world trying to figure out
84:11
who they were they knew they were
84:13
dancers that was what he made them it
84:15
was their passion from the time they
84:17
were three four and eight that's all
84:21
they ever did they didn't want to be
84:23
something else they knew they were a
84:26
gift sent from heaven and that's the
84:28
gift they were every good and perfect
84:31
gift comes down from the father of you
84:35
were those lights why would he say that
84:38
why would he put that in the same thing
84:40
why would he say that together every
84:43
good and perfect gift comes down from
84:44
the Father of lights you were the lights
84:47
your spare man's made out of light you
84:49
were a gift he sent you it's not that
84:53
hard that's God to give you revelation I
84:59
want you to enjoy your life I want you
85:02
to celebrate your life you choose every
85:07
day to be happy you're not happy there's
85:09
no excuse to not be happy you don't have
85:11
to keep that junk in you so stand up
85:15
we're gonna do it I know you've done it
85:16
again we're gonna do it i'ma pray over
85:18
you and I'm gonna let you go
85:19
amen I know there's new people here if
85:24
you don't know about a soul checkup it's
85:26
a lifestyle it is a lifestyle it will
85:31
keep you so full of God so happy so
85:34
inspired it opens up portals of heaven
85:36
over you you get witty ideas and
85:39
inventions you can even share it with
85:40
others to help them because you have a
85:45
will you can do this you have a soul he
85:48
gave it to you you decide to use it or
85:51
not using I'm not forcing anyone you say
85:52
yes or no you do it or you don't do it
85:54
it's really easy because almost
85:56
everything God ever gave us is some
85:59
he talks to me like I'm eight he doesn't
86:04
give me big words he doesn't give me any
86:08
long you know any long definitions on
86:12
stuff he keeps it really simple that's
86:15
why eight-year-olds can read my book and
86:17
if they follow me and they come to a
86:19
meeting they won't want their own they
86:22
don't want to share it with their
86:23
parents and their parents we'll play
86:27
there's over 400 hours of me speaking on
86:29
YouTube a lot of them played me all
86:31
night long and those kids love it they
86:34
wander no truth they want to know who
86:36
God is no one can tell them there's
86:38
something else because what you fill
86:41
yourself with you will become amen so
86:46
this is so simple you're gonna choose
86:47
with your will to do this first you're
86:51
gonna choose and say I choose my will to
86:53
lose from my soul and then I'll give a
86:55
list of most things that people have in
86:57
their souls if I don't say something you
86:59
can say it yourself you can also lose
87:01
soul ties you made with other people
87:03
that didn't treat you nice so good you
87:05
can loose them from your soul then when
87:07
we're all done because I see Jesus come
87:10
down and he pulls things out of you
87:11
literally it's like grey matter he pulls
87:13
it out and then you bind things of God
87:18
and they come in waves each thing you
87:22
say it comes in a wave and I feel it go
87:25
through me and through everybody here
87:26
like the love of God the life I feel it
87:29
comes like a wave so here we go are you
87:31
ready you say as a child of God I choose
87:36

87:38

23:50
[Music]
23:52
thank you teagan renato
23:56
we've got so many guests here tonight we
23:57
want to talk a little bit about protocol
23:58
and what's going on
23:59
um we want to minister to you our desire
24:02
the deepest desire of everyone here in
24:04
this house is that you have a personal
24:05
encounter with god tonight
24:07
that he speaks to you personally that he
24:09
touches your heart
24:10
and you get to see and hear him in a new
24:12
and special way tonight
24:14
and so that's why they want special ed
24:16
to say that to you
24:17
so we have some protocols for it if you
24:18
came with somebody you know obviously it
24:20
doesn't
24:21
we don't want to tell you you can't pray
24:22
for your family or anything like that
24:23
but here's what we do ask if it's not
24:24
someone you know or someone you came
24:26
with
24:26
we ask that you do not pray for other
24:28
people we have special team fire team
24:29
you'll notice people throughout the
24:31
house with tags like this
24:32
fire team tags we want to minister to
24:34
you and these are people who have been
24:36
specially annoyed especially chosen
24:37
within the house
24:38
so they can pray with you and pray for
24:39
you if you have a need seek someone out
24:41
we're more than happy to minister to you
24:43
after service will probably be the ones
24:44
to be ministering to you but we just
24:46
don't want to have
24:46
everybody ministering to everybody
24:48
because we want to make sure you're
24:49
guarded we want to make sure that that's
24:50
done in a special way and it's done
24:51
with an anointed in presence of the
24:53
house and what god's doing here tonight
24:55
so we ask that you do that
24:56
again when we let our hair down and do
24:58
this you're welcome
24:59
to come up and worship and really let it
25:01

from heaven earth
98:54
this night i light a flame on the top of
98:58
this mountain
99:00
it will never be put off
99:06
for you have stood to adversity
99:10
through the lies to the accusations
99:15
through the control the demands of
99:18
man you have worshipped me
99:23
you have not forgotten my son you have
99:26
not forgotten what he's done
99:29
you will be blessed and you will never
99:32
stop being blessed
99:36
for i am the god of everybody
99:40
and the god of everything i'm about to
99:43
shake this
99:44
earth great exposure of the darkness
99:54
matter what people or the fake news
99:57
or the lying liberals have said about me
100:01
or this time they don't
100:05
know anything
100:08
[Music]
100:12
if they do not stop they will lose
100:15
everything their words will become
100:19
dust and blown away like they were never
100:22
there
100:25
for i say this is a time of greatness
100:28
of acceleration you've never known are
100:31
the manifested sons and daughters
100:35
to come forth to demonstrate to manifest
100:39
my power my love
100:44
my plans the devil has plans
100:52
he will fail and he will lose
100:55
again and again and again
101:00
and again and again and again
101:06
[Music]
101:08
for i have already said i will be in the
101:11
white house for
101:12
24 years
101:20
there is no one on this earth in this
101:23
earth
101:24
under this earth that can stop it from
101:26
happening
101:29
for i will have these days on the earth
101:32
the great days
101:34
the great days of knowing there is a god
101:38
that he speaks that he sears sees and
101:44
hears
101:46
if my prophets do not prophesy what i
101:49
say
101:50
they will not have a voice until that
101:52
season is over
101:55
for these are not the days of doom and
101:56
gloom
101:58
these are not the days of the rapture
102:00
the perilous times the tribulation
102:05
they're times of greatness
102:09
of the fire and the glory sweeping over
102:12
this earth touching everyone
102:16
crushing the darkness and pushing it
102:18
back
102:21
for i am cleaning the stage
102:25
wiping it clean are the enemies camp
102:28
are the enemy's people are the enemies
102:31
dust
102:32
[Music]
102:34
for i will have my way my son made a way
102:40
i will not ignore what he has done and i
102:43
will not have a weak pathetic testimony
102:45
of his sacrifice
102:50
no one says when he is coming back but
102:54
me
102:55
and i am not ready
102:59
for i will set you on fire
103:02
and you will demonstrate like no one has
103:05
before in all of history
103:08
the powerful things of god to speak to
103:10
the land
103:11
the sea in the air and it will move
103:15
do not tolerate evil and do not
103:17
participate with it
103:21
you choose life or death
103:24
because they're apparently out there
103:26
right now
103:28
always choose life
103:31
for when you side with those who want
103:33
death of the unburned
103:36
you will never win you will never
103:40
succeed or complete your destiny
103:43
you will repent
103:47
because i bring life and life abundantly
103:52
but you must choose it and if you choose
103:55
it
103:56
you must live it
103:59
get out of the gray area stop riding on
104:02
the fence
104:05
for i hear those who've humbled
104:07
themselves whose heart cries out for
104:10
more but this time
104:14
you get to bring them more
104:21
i said it would be my sons and daughters
104:24
who did it
104:26
there is no age for them whether it's
104:29
three
104:31
or 153
104:35
you choose
104:38
for if you sit on the side and do
104:39
nothing that's what you will have
104:42
a boring life an unfruitful life
104:46
be bold and step out let people know
104:50
what you believe
104:51
and who you believe they'll come beating
104:55
your door down
104:56
to find out about your god not the false
105:00
gods who have no life
105:03
not the lies of the enemy he thinks he
105:06
can take
105:07
my country for it is mine
105:12
i created it i called it into being
105:16
i had people fight for it and die for it
105:21
in the seasons past you've died
105:25
to live for me but it now you will live
105:28
and not die if you choose
105:33
was it what is it to you if i keep you
105:37
until my son returns
105:42
be strong be excited
105:47
and celebrate the victory even before it
105:50
happens
105:51
[Music]
105:56
do not listen to the doom and gloom
105:59
that does not come from me
106:03
but fearful hearts that don't know what
106:06
time it is
106:06
they don't know what my plans are and
106:09
they want to escape
106:15
run your race but run it with me
106:22
for i'll be right beside you and i will
106:26
open the eyes of many
106:28
and they will see me and they will know
106:31
their god
106:33
those who have stood and been faithful
106:36
even under attack even though things
106:37
were taken from you
106:39
do you not think i can give you a
106:41
hundred times more than what you had
106:47
it is my desire to bless you
106:50
it is my desire to be with you
106:56
for there are times there are only in
107:00
the power of my hand
107:03
and these are some of those times
107:10
listen to what is true where there is no
107:14
confusion
107:15
and nothing hidden
107:18
don't believe the lies of those who live
107:20
in sin and say they live and speak for
107:23
me
107:25
some have removed from the earth
107:27
[Music]
107:28
i won't allow their testimony of who i
107:31
am to be here
107:37
many who are lying cheating and stealing
107:40
and even killing
107:42
will lose not just their state but their
107:45
life
107:49
this is a holy time but it is a time
107:52
to celebrate
107:56
heaven celebrates with this time
107:59
live on earth like they live in heaven
108:04
but you have to be willing and
108:07
obedient
108:10
the host will not listen to those
108:13
to be commanded by those who do not
108:16
speak the words of my son
108:18
nor have him in their heart not just as
108:22
their savior
108:23
but as their king
108:28
many kings will come forth in this time
108:31
for my son is the king of spiritual
108:34
kings
108:35
and the lord of spiritual lords
108:40
and the spirit there is no difference
108:42
between male nor female
108:46
both can rise to that position
108:50
of authority and dominion
108:54
but you have to pursue it
108:55
[Music]
108:57
and if you want my thoughts you better
109:01
walk in my ways
109:04
and you better say his will
109:09
his way not his will
109:12
man's way
109:16
i'm about to consume this country
109:21
and people will come here to find me not
109:25
just the american dream
109:31
some regions the light and the glory
109:33
will be so great in
109:34
people will drive their dead relatives
109:37
in there they'll come to life
109:43
neither sin nor crime nor sickness will
109:46
be able to abide in those regions
109:50
[Music]
109:51
you are forerunners it is an honor and a
109:54
privilege to be chosen
109:58
if you're alive and you're breathing
110:01
and you've given yourself to my son you
110:04
are chosen
110:11
know this night that your god has
110:13
visited you
110:16
and spoken his words to you
110:20
if they don't light up with others then
110:23
do not receive
110:24
those words for i stand on my work
110:30
and beside my son on my throne
110:36
these are days we have talked about
110:38
before you were ever
110:39
born before the earth was made we spoke
110:42
of these days
110:44
why would i give them up
110:53
if you buy a bible and it says it's my
110:56
word and it's left parts out
110:58
don't read it
111:02
if it makes it easy to live to freely
111:05
sin
111:07
there's other gods beside me that can
111:10
bring you to my home
111:12
those are lies from hell
111:16
for my word and my truth
111:19
will make you free
111:22
says your god a man
111:34
[Music]
111:50
[Music]
112:00
oh
112:06
can you hear me now
112:21
[Music]
112:22
i know there are people who will tell
112:24
you that you cannot see the faces of god
112:27
and live but even the one who spoke
112:31
those words
112:32
and they were written in the word saw
112:35
the face of god
112:37
john himself in the book of john said
112:40
you cannot see the face of god and live
112:43
but in the book of revelation in chapter
112:46
4
112:47
he was caught up
112:52
he was in the spirit
112:55
that's a place you walk in
113:01
he's in a place on that day where he
113:04
could hear no word of man
113:06
on the isle of patmos at least that day
113:10
unless he decided to walk off of it
113:15
i chose to let him see things are
113:24
different
113:30
because he was in that place i could
113:32
catch him up
113:34
and stand before my throne with the
113:37
living rainbow
113:38
moving in and out of me with
113:41
life moving in and out of me
113:45
and he saw my face
113:48
and never again after that did he say
113:51
you cannot see the face of god and live
113:57
for i have caught many up and showed
113:59
many my face
114:02
my plans but this one standing before
114:06
you she is my revelator
114:10
i will never stop taking her to heaven
114:13
what business is it to you if i want to
114:18
i held the air you breathe
114:21
if i choose somebody
114:24
who's been willing and obedient and laid
114:27
down their life
114:30
every time i asked
114:36
why would i not trust her
114:40
yes she's a woman and she's a king in
114:44
the spirit
114:51
she's not just my servant she is my
114:54
daughter
114:57
and it is my great pleasure to reveal
115:00
her
115:00
as my treasure to operate without
115:03
measuring these days
115:06
[Music]
115:09
if you're willing to pay the price
115:14
you think it's so easy
115:18
to have to live a halfway normal life on
115:20
this earth
115:21
when you're so connected to me in heaven
115:26
she does not see things like you see
115:30
them
115:32
but she will reveal everything i show
115:34
her
115:36
and will not be afraid of the face of
115:38
man
115:40
even hell trembles when she speaks
115:46
[Applause]
115:48
everyone should be dangerous against
115:50
hell
115:53
[Music]
115:56
it is evil and wickedness that tries to
115:59
consume your country
116:01
but i will not tolerate it for my people
116:05
have humbled themselves
116:09
they have repented of their wicked ways
116:13
and i will heal their land
116:16
[Music]
116:22
for i hear everyone and i see everyone
116:25
nothing is hidden
116:26
from me
116:29
when i look at the earth i rejoice
116:36
i remember when my son and i made it
116:40
we made it to kerry the glory
116:43
the power the wonder
116:50
a stopover station before you come home
117:03
i know your trials i know your test
117:08
if you fall down get up
117:11
[Applause]
117:16
tell the enemy you will no longer
117:17
tolerate him in your life
117:20
that means you will not tolerate his
117:22
images his words
117:24
his frequencies his songs
117:34
you create a habitation for heaven in
117:37
your home
117:39
and it will come
117:43
you will see angels coming and going for
117:52
you are in a new season
117:55
the season of the high call of god of
117:57
your god
118:01
why did you not expect for things to be
118:04
exposed
118:06
before every great thing was done hell
118:09
always acted up
118:14
but this time the exposure is for your
118:16
benefit
118:19
these are not new things they've always
118:21
been here
118:22
you just never knew it
118:26
i'm pulling away every closed door
118:30
basement building
118:34
things hidden in the wilderness things
118:36
hidden in the forest
118:38
even things hidden underground i will
118:40
expose it all
118:49
[Applause]
118:50
the lives of those those who want to
118:53
stand and run your country
118:56
but hate me hate life
119:00
even hate the people they want to govern
119:03
it will not happen
119:05
[Applause]
119:12
for i will shake them
119:15
and nothing will be hidden but openly
119:19
shown
119:20
and dealt with even those have already
119:23
been in power and think they've gotten
119:25
away with it
119:30
they will not
119:39
trump may not be perfect
119:43
but he gives me permission
119:48
to be in this country from the highest
119:52
office in the land he has welcomed me
119:56
and prayed to me and made friends with
119:59
my pastors
120:01
my prophets my teachers my evangelist
120:08
his closest friends are my sons and
120:10
daughters
120:13
but the world would reject them and hate
120:15
them
120:18
there are many people in this world
120:19
praying for your president
120:22
even they love him even they recognize
120:26
the good in him the authority in him
120:31
he will help to shift many leaders of
120:33
many governments
120:35
so i can shape that nation
120:42
and he will sweep his platform clean one
120:45
day
120:46
to make room for pence
120:50
i have heard words spoken against my
120:53
vice president
120:54
and i am not happy
120:58
he is a godly man who is not afraid of
121:02
anything
121:05
he is a strong tower to temper your
121:08
president
121:17
he will win two terms also
121:23
[Applause]
121:28
for i have written that in my book and
121:30
what my book says
121:32
it will happen not maybe happen
121:36
[Applause]
121:38
whoever he picks to be his vice
121:40
president will then be president for
121:42
eight years after him
121:46
by that time there'll be no opposition
121:48
that will even have a voice to speak
121:50
[Music]
121:51
[Applause]
121:56
america will be a great light to this
121:58
world
122:02
it is my gift to this world
122:07
who allows my son my greatest gift to
122:09
operate in this world
122:14
get ready because the show is beginning
122:18
[Applause]
122:23
[Music]
122:39
there's coming a day when people will
122:41
step into
122:43
a store thinking they're going to buy
122:44
something
122:46
and they will step into my glory and
122:48
begin to cry out to know me
122:51
[Music]
122:57
satan knows about these days
123:01
but he was hoping he could stop them
123:12
this is a place of freedom liberty and
123:15
justice for all
123:19
it is also a place for righteousness and
123:22
holiness
123:27
that your amazing forefathers heard my
123:31
voice
123:31
and made plans for it
123:35
the enemy has always been afraid of
123:40
america
123:46
don't be afraid
123:50
even if you come home you'll be with me
123:55
there is no fear not even in death
123:59
you just step from life to life
124:04
[Applause]
124:07
if your family live here they're the
124:10
most blessed
124:11
people in existence
124:18
make plans to be great
124:23
because it is time
124:29
for i will pour out my spirit on all
124:30
flesh
124:36
children will begin to pastor at age
124:38
five
124:40
[Applause]
124:47
children are the easiest to reach
124:49
because they don't question
124:51
and they don't reason and they don't let
124:53
their mind
124:54
get involved that's why i said you must
124:58
be like a little child
125:02
to enter into the kingdom
125:10
you have not because you asked not
125:14
but those who've asked already will
125:16
surely get what they have asked for
125:23
it is a new time on the earth
125:28
a miracle will be an example
125:31
but many countries will run to the light
125:34
and to my son
125:40
for there is a habitation coming
125:45
that will not end until i say it will
125:50
[Applause]
126:00
end rejoice that i have shown these
126:03
things and spoken to you of these things
126:08
for those are my plans
126:17
the more you believe it is real
126:20
the more real it will become
126:37
there's coming a day very soon that when
126:40
you come here
126:44
the glory will be waiting
126:59
portals are being opened everywhere
127:05
for heaven to pour in
127:08
but also for blessings to pour in
127:22
those who say i cannot speak through the
127:25
voice
127:26
of a man or mankind
127:29
don't know me
127:37
make sure you laugh
127:41
laughter is the language of heaven
127:46
but profanity is the language of hell
127:51
don't let those words be in your mouth
127:54
in your home
127:58
allowed to enter into your home
128:02
guard your soul and the souls of your
128:04
children
128:06
by not letting anything pass
128:10
through any form of media
128:15
it will be a trap of the enemy
128:18
and what you've given permission to come
128:21
will come
128:38
if you say good morning to me every
128:41
morning
128:42
you'll be saying it before my throne
128:48
you command the day by what you choose
128:51
when you first wake
128:53
up
128:59
choose life and love
129:03
my power my presence
129:07
extreme discernment
129:15
and get understanding
129:20
these days will come quickly
129:24
and your life will change day by day
129:32
so all who hear this message
129:36
if you are my son or my daughter
129:39
if you have received my son and repented
129:42
of your sins
129:43
these words are for you
129:52
do not walk around
129:55
with your head held down but lift it
129:59
up
130:03
where your help comes from
130:07
even if people laugh they will
130:10
not be laughing for long term
130:17
pray for those who have chosen the
130:19
darkness
130:21
and are expecting it to win some will
130:23
take their life
130:24
when they lose because
130:28
their souls have been compromised
130:32
by the lies they've been listening to
130:35
guard well the layers of your soul what
130:38
you put there
130:45
and always choose life
130:50
i love you says your god amen
130:58
[Applause]
131:04
[Music]
131:10
[Music]
131:14
yes
131:15
[Music]
131:15
[Applause]
131:19
[Music]
131:22
yes
131:24
[Music]
131:50
oh
132:00
it is hard to stand
132:03
i won't fall
132:08
i'm sure my angels are behind me
132:16
i don't want a stool
132:23
what is that
132:32
no
132:35
no but we could just lay hands on
132:38
everybody and end it
132:43
[Music]
132:47
it's pretty pretty hard to top god
132:58
and for those of you who don't think
133:00
this is real may he come to you
133:04
[Music]
133:14
when i walked in the angel of the lord
133:16
who looks just like jesus
133:18
came in behind me to make sure i
133:21
wouldn't fall down before i got up here
133:26
and god's been speaking to me like the
133:29
last several hours before i got here
133:32
and some people think why is she late
133:33
why is she late well are you going to
133:35
turn around and say no
133:37
to god
133:45
i was right on time
133:59
god was very wise calling me a revelator
134:03
instead of a prophet because he knew all
134:06
the bashers
134:08
wouldn't know what a false revelator was
134:14
[Music]
134:15
[Applause]
134:23
he was very detailed with me before i
134:26
started traveling and speaking
134:28
and he'd already warned me about a lot
134:30
of stuff that would happen or would be
134:32
said which
134:33
i understand people don't understand
134:37
what they don't know or they have not
134:39
experienced their self
134:41
it is hard for them to receive it
134:46
seeing is not believing
134:50
receiving is believing
135:00
god has given me many titles i didn't
135:02
ask for any of them
135:06
and many people say i want to be you i
135:07
go no you don't
135:12
you don't really and i've heard people
135:14
say he chose seven men before he chose
135:16
you no he didn't
135:20
he did choose me he knew me when i was
135:23
in him he knew every one of you
135:26
already knew what you would become and
135:29
on your soul that he created he wrote if
135:31
he would be male or female
135:34
no matter how man says how that happens
135:39
and your soul will be conflicted if
135:40
you're told you're something else
135:46
because your soul already knew what it
135:48
was supposed to be
135:52
but if the ones who wanted to take over
135:54
have their way
135:56
they would let anybody choose whatever
135:57
they want to
136:02
but god has a plan
136:05
you were with him before you came to
136:06
this earth before this world was made
136:09
before he stretched out the universe the
136:11
physical realm
136:12
over the spiritual realm that's why when
136:15
it says in revelations he will roll it
136:17
up
136:18
he knows where the ends are
136:23
he had to put something out there that
136:25
he could put physical things on
136:27
because all he had the original realm is
136:30
the spiritual realm
136:32
the unseen realm unless he lets you see
136:35
it
136:36
from the time i was little i was a seer
136:40
i saw the good guys and the bad guys
136:43
i saw activities at the spirit realm you
136:46
hear people talk about angels and demons
136:48
there's much more than that
136:49
all around you there's buildings built
136:51
that both sides
136:53
use depending on what is going around in
136:55
that area
136:57
there's platforms built by these spirits
137:00
of wickedness in high places how do they
137:01
get in high places
137:03
they earn it by hunting for souls for
137:06
the enemy
137:07
these are wicked spiritual beings
137:09
however
137:12
when you learn to command an army that
137:14
was created to pull down
137:16
every stronghold of satan they're
137:20
the ones who war against hell
137:23
no matter what level of wickedness they
137:25
operate in
137:26
they can shred those platforms built by
137:29
these spirits of wickedness in high
137:30
places
137:32
and they go through light buzz saws and
137:36
they can't stop it from happening
137:38
because we who have the flesh
137:42
you're the ones who have authority in
137:44
the earth
137:45
every spirit would be coming from hell
137:47
trying to take over
137:48
they use people like they apparently are
137:50
right now
137:51
but they cannot do it they can't
137:55
the earth is made for men and those who
137:58
receive jesus christ
138:00
you're called to rule in the spirit
138:02
realm
138:04
when you take authority and dominion in
138:05
the spirit realm it then in
138:07
packs and packs this physical realm
138:12
and because we haven't known how to do
138:14
it to his fullness
138:15
satan has just taken all he wants to
138:19
done what he wanted to kill who he wants
138:22
to
138:23
put fear in who he wants to we're not
138:26
tolerating it anymore
138:32
jesus clearly said the things i did you
138:34
will do and greater
138:36
things you will do than i did
138:40
so you should be trying to stop the
138:42
storms
138:45
we can help you do that
138:48
you can either email or call our office
138:51
and ask for
138:52
weather warrior information that's god's
138:54
name
138:56
that he gave for this group who's
138:59
willing to step
139:00
out and just do what his son did
139:03
i didn't pick that name we are to take
139:06
authority over
139:06
any form of destructive weather
139:11
and whether you know it or not in the
139:13
word of god when he made the ocean
139:15
and he made the land he told the ocean i
139:18
set a boundary right here at the land
139:22
and you will not pass over
139:28
that's god's word that's his decree we
139:31
are his sons and daughters it is
139:33
our job to uphold that
139:37
and tell those storms you will not cross
139:40
over on the land or do destruction
139:42
he created the weather to nourish the
139:45
earth
139:47
not to damage it
139:51
so we sit down here and say god come and
139:53
rescue us
139:56
come and stop this and he's looking down
139:58
saying i gave you authority
140:01
you have authority you
140:04
rule because the enemy knows he can get
140:06
in and twist any of those weather system
140:09
and use them the best he can because he
140:12
comes to what
140:13
kill steal destroy
140:16
and one of the ways he does that is with
140:18
the weather
140:21
so our volcanoes are not supposed to be
140:23
erupting
140:24
tsunamis are not supposed to be
140:26
destroying
140:28
none of that stuff that's going on but
140:31
there's been no voice
140:33
or agreement in the body that they would
140:36
no longer
140:37
tolerate that
140:40
he taught the disciples how to multiply
140:44
food how to travel in the spirit realm
140:48
how to take authority and dominion over
140:51
all the power of the darkness cast out
140:53
any and all demons
140:56
to pray for the sick to be healed why
140:59
are we tolerating
141:00
the virus
141:05
because i'm not it has no right here
141:13
the body needs to wake up stand up
141:18
and step out you can wake up all you
141:21
want to
141:22
he wants you to do all of those things
141:26
and i can tell you right now the
141:28
meteorologists don't know what's
141:29
happening
141:31
they're going wild we even have some of
141:34
their briefings where they talked about
141:36
what is wrong with this weather they're
141:39
almost
141:40
afraid to give a forecast of anything
141:43
because it never happens and then they
141:46
faked it
141:49
they faked it to prove these things were
141:51
happening those weren't even the storm
141:52
that was going on
141:56
those in the area that the storms are
141:58
headed to have the greatest authority if
142:00
you're a believer
142:04
so those on the east coast
142:07
we have melt we have built a wall
142:10
and if you go back and look at every
142:12
storm that's come after
142:14
dorian when we told it we all started
142:17
saying you will not and cannot cross
142:18
over
142:19
the boundaries god set for you and all
142:21
the way down not just in florida where
142:23
we started it
142:24
all the way up the east coast believers
142:26
were standing there saying you will not
142:27
cross over and do destruction
142:29
and every time a storm comes you can go
142:31
look at it
142:32
it comes a certain way then it hits the
142:34
wall and goes back out
142:38
and they don't understand it's simply
142:42
the body of christ
142:43
taking authority
142:46
so when we learn oh hawaii has got it
142:49
down
142:52
we have a lot of friends there's a lot
142:53
of weather warriors that live in hawaii
142:55
it doesn't even get started before they
142:56
get out there and they start
143:00
i'll never forget the time that this
143:02
massive like i think was category five
143:04
was coming
143:05
and i had been teaching and talking to
143:07
him about taking authority
143:09
and we all declared that this storm will
143:11
not be allowed to come ashore
143:13
and the head of it would be taken off
143:17
and when everyone went to bed except me
143:20
because i don't sleep at night
143:23
when they all went to bed when they woke
143:24
up there was nothing but shreds left
143:28
and they couldn't understand or get it
143:30
they knew for sure that the the island
143:32
would be consumed
143:34
and those people those weatherboards in
143:36
hawaii would not let up that prayer of
143:38
agreement we had
143:40
they said we don't know how it happened
143:41
but it looks like the head was taken
143:44
these are the meteorologists saying this
143:46
the head was taken right off
143:48
[Music]
143:50
it was a nothing and one reporter said
143:54
never in
143:54
25 years of being a meteorologist i ever
143:58
see i never saw that happen i'm still
144:01
trying to go back over all the tapes
144:03
all the information that we've
144:04
accumulated to know exactly what
144:06
should have happened and it didn't
144:08
happen
144:11
why because they're not tolerating it
144:15
so whoever lives in the gulf better
144:16
start stepping up
144:21
is not coming to florida
144:25
i live there and i'm not putting up with
144:28
it anymore
144:31
[Applause]
144:36
you need to just get fed up
144:46
what yes
144:50
whoever has the fires
144:55
in your state you better start saying
144:57
you're not tolerating it anymore
145:02
you come into low pressure system to
145:05
form
145:06
and come in and put the fires out
145:10
[Applause]
145:13
that is not something new in the bible
145:16
they called forth rain to come
145:19
and they begin to see the clouds form
145:22
did it
145:22
come and did it rain
145:28
why are we any different than them
145:31
it's called believing your faith
145:35
and guess what in heaven you'll need
145:36
your faith
145:38
not to pay your rent not to be healed
145:42
not for any of those things but to begin
145:45
to create
145:49
who is our father
145:54
do you know in the bible when it says
145:56
let us make men in our image that's what
145:58
they look like
146:00
like with the glory on them the light of
146:02
god on them
146:04
but after our likeness is how they
146:06
operate
146:09
we're supposed to operate like them we
146:11
are not god
146:14
you don't want to be god i don't want to
146:16
be god
146:18
i've seen a lot but i still don't want
146:19
to be god no one's that many kids
146:30
the devil actually isn't god's problem
146:35
it's how we all pray and stand against
146:37
them
146:40
he should be running does it say he will
146:42
run from us
146:46
do you remember that scripture
146:50
you submit yourself under the hand of
146:51
god and
146:53
resist the enemy
146:56
what will he do he will flee
147:00
from you he's talking to you
147:03
you do you know the word resist doesn't
147:06
go
147:06
oh no no i don't know what there's
147:08
something
147:10
i will not tolerate you you're a liar
147:13
and a friar
147:15
and i serve the most high god only him
147:24
and he'll run
147:28
there are people the demons beg not to
147:31
be assigned to
147:34
because when they come back and they're
147:36
not successful with their assignment
147:38
they get punished
147:40
the devil doesn't give anybody rewards
147:42
not even his own he just punishes them
147:44
when they don't listen
147:47
so they don't want to they'll lie
147:48
they'll do anything they can
147:50
they don't want to and by the way when
147:51
you learn to release the anointing they
147:53
burn on and it hurts they'll burn
147:57
if they get near the fire of god it will
147:58
burn them like it's going to melt them
148:01
they may live in hell's fire they don't
148:04
want god's fire
148:07
that's why baptism in fire is coming
148:12
[Applause]
148:15
see i was raised on the word of god
148:19
god chose when my birth would happen on
148:22
this earth
148:23
he chose my fathers my mothers by the
148:25
way my mother is here tonight
148:32
she'll be 90 next april
148:35
she had 15 children
148:39
i am number three and my sister's number
148:42
15 right there
148:45
and any of them could testify to
148:48
anything i am saying
148:50
i never was normal
148:56
i didn't want to speak to people even
148:58
though i was i didn't want to speak to
148:59
people i didn't want to hug them
149:03
i just wanted god jesus holy spirit you
149:05
know my little nice
149:06
apartment somewhere and do big business
149:10
he took me out of my world of business
149:13
yeah it's like he didn't know he needed
149:15
paychecks
149:18
seriously he did this he always told me
149:21
before he would do something
149:22
with me my grandmother was my dad's
149:25
mother was a powerful woman of god
149:27
she was in the jungles of panama and was
149:29
afraid of nothing
149:32
ever she'd come to our home on
149:35
sabbatical i mean we had more kids than
149:36
anybody she could have come any
149:38
anywhere i don't remember she had eight
149:39
or nine
149:41
of her own our aunts and uncles
149:44
so she had a lot of children but she
149:46
always came
149:47
to our house because god was there we
149:50
knew she could see through the walls
149:53
we knew she could see right inside of us
149:57
and every time she came she'd lay her
149:58
hand on her head you will
150:00
serve and know the most high god and my
150:04
brother would run and hide
150:07
i'm not going to be a missionary and be
150:08
eaten by the alligators or crocodiles
150:12
no right now they lock them on death row
150:14
to minister to death apprentice
150:16
prisoners
150:18
he's invited by hell's angels to come
150:19
and do funerals
150:22
i don't think he's afraid of crocodiles
150:24
anymore
150:28
my mom would tell me every day you are
150:30
so strange i don't know what god's going
150:32
to do with you
150:35
i was little i ate once a day i slept
150:38
four hours a day
150:40
my whole life i would know things
150:43
my siblings didn't care too much for
150:45
that
150:52
my dad was a great mentor but his own
150:55
mother in the jungles of panama on her
150:57
own
150:58
they had a murderer loose in the village
151:00
i know some of you heard the story
151:01
before but it just shows you
151:02
who she was she was on the mission field
151:05
in the little hut somewhere where she
151:06
was ministering and she i think she
151:08
lived there for
151:09
i forgot how many years many years and
151:11
everybody was boarding up their windows
151:13
to keep this murder from out she left
151:14
her window open
151:17
and she went to sleep right in front of
151:21
the window
151:24
because guess what she knew god sure
151:26
enough
151:27
late at night here comes a foot in the
151:29
window
151:30
and this huge machete coming with him
151:33
and she turn around look at him and she
151:34
goes freeze in jesus name
151:38
and rolled over and went back to sleep
151:42
and three hours later when the police
151:44
arrived
151:45
he was still frozen
151:50
[Applause]
151:53
that was my grandmother
152:02
i was taught to never be afraid
152:07
i knew there was a god i knew there was
152:09
his son
152:10
i knew there was holy spirit who is my
152:12
best friend
152:14
that means he'll tweak you 24 hours a
152:17
day
152:19
that's what that means let me speak to
152:21
you 24 hours a day but lots of times
152:23
he's tweaking you
152:28
he wouldn't warn me something's going to
152:29
happen i don't think i'd do that that's
152:31
what he says to me
152:33
i don't think i'd go there so i'm not
152:35
going to go there okay
152:36
i don't ask him why
152:40
but you have to have your ears open to
152:42
listen
152:43
and it's really good idea if you say i
152:46
choose holy spirit to give you
152:47
permission to get my attention when i'm
152:49
not paying attention
152:51
it is one of the most powerful things
152:53
you can say
152:54
anybody here let's just say it together
152:56
holy spirit
152:58
from this moment on i give you
153:02
permission
153:04
to get my attention when i'm not paying
153:07
attention
153:09
so be it there you did it
153:17
i did that when i was really young it
153:19
saved me a lot
153:21
let me tell you if i gave the mic to jen
153:24
she'd come up here now she would preach
153:26
all the time
153:27
she knows that's true because he does
153:28
the same thing with her
153:32
every morning
153:36
it's called living a new life
153:39
heaven culture isn't just a thing it's a
153:42
lifestyle
153:45
so if you want to live on earth as they
153:47
live in heaven you need to learn to live
153:49
heaven culture
153:52
what is that how they live in heaven
153:55
and living the same way on the earth
153:57
they're free of fear free of lack
154:00
free of grief free of anything of the
154:02
enemy
154:04
never sick they go well they're in
154:05
heaven yes
154:07
they are but our father who is in heaven
154:11
holy is your name your kingdom come by
154:14
the way
154:15
that is heaven your kingdom
154:19
is heaven you're speaking to the
154:22
father right your kingdom come
154:26
your will be done on earth as it is in
154:28
heaven that is heaven
154:30
culture you are literally praying a
154:32
prayer that asks for heaven culture
154:37
and he's released it on the earth you
154:40
choose it
154:42
you lose everything under your soul
154:43
that's not him every trauma from the
154:46
past every wicked evil
154:49
disgusting vile movie you've ever
154:50
watched with your eyes it's in your soul
154:54
that's why he says to guard it for out
154:56
of it will flow the way you live your
154:58
life
155:00
as a man think it's in his heart which
155:02
is your soul
155:03
not talking about your human beating
155:04
heart the heart also means the core
155:07
or the center of something that's your
155:09
soul that's what you are you are a
155:11
living soul
155:13
and what you fill it with is what you
155:15
will become
155:17
that's why people you've known all your
155:18
life kind nice people i know some of
155:20
them
155:21
who now hate with a hate i've never seen
155:23
before in people
155:25
they hate and despise don't even know
155:26
why why they listen to the fake news
155:30
and for years they have filled their
155:31
layers you have layers
155:33
whatever you feel the most of is what
155:35
you're going to begin to act like
155:40
so if you don't like you change what
155:42
you're watching
155:43
even what you say goes in your own soul
155:45
so if you don't like you
155:46
you've been telling yourself that for
155:48
years and you put another layer of it in
155:50
you
155:51
and what's in there is what you will
155:52
think about and if you think about it
155:53
you're going to choose it if you choose
155:55
it you're going to do it again that's
155:56
called
155:56
what criminals do
155:59
this is true that's why a criminal will
156:02
get out of prison
156:03
go commit a crime and go back right back
156:05
to prison if they've been there 20 years
156:06
it'll you know why it's in their soul
156:09
and i've been to prison to talk
156:13
it's good to hear that and i had 80
156:17
prisoners
156:18
and they had somebody guards trying to
156:20
watch
156:21
they never watched they listened to
156:23
protect me
156:24
my husband was with me sitting up here
156:26
staring at every one of them
156:32
but then even he was crying and i told
156:35
them how they were sought out by the
156:36
enemy even as a little child
156:38
they had a great call on their life so
156:40
he didn't want them to be loosed on the
156:42
earth
156:43
they might find out who they are and do
156:45
destruction to his plans
156:47
so he gets them into crime this is truth
156:49
he gets them into crime when you do it
156:51
it was in your soul
156:53
then he makes sure they get caught
156:57
and then they get put in prison where
156:59
they can't be a threat to him
157:02
so every time they get up because it's
157:03
in them guess what they do it doesn't
157:04
matter how much therapy they give them
157:06
how many classes they take them to if
157:08
they can't get it out of them
157:11
they'll think about it they'll do it and
157:14
then they're back in the same place
157:16
so i told them the story of their life
157:18
this is what you're doing this is why
157:19
you're doing it
157:20
this is what god had for you this is
157:22
what satan is doing to you
157:24
and will proceed to do it to every
157:25
member of your family if you can
157:27
then they begin to cry then they get
157:28
furious
157:30
you get mad at the devil then they get
157:33
born again
157:33
filled with the holy spirit then it
157:35
teaches them how to war
157:38
i teach them how to send heaven's army
157:40
so now
157:41
insider prisons are very dangerous
157:44
people
157:44
who are dangerous against hell
157:51
i mean anybody could go to prison right
157:53
but why are these people in rhythm
157:55
they are dangerous because of their
157:58
destiny
157:59
and satan doesn't want them loose
158:06
your soul is very important to you don't
158:09
ever forget that
158:11
you choose with your soul all day long
158:16
you choose christ right after that you
158:18
should choose what he chooses
158:20
all day long you should guide what you
158:23
choose what you watch what you say
158:26
i love that little saying these half
158:28
years what would jesus do
158:30
what would he say what would he choose
158:35
it's actually a very free life
158:38
to not sin people get shocked when they
158:42
say
158:42
i don't sin oh that's impossible no it's
158:46
not
158:48
you choose not to
158:52
you just say no
158:55
say no to who was ever asking you sorry
158:57
my soul is too important
159:00
i'm not corrupting my soul they'd really
159:02
think you were weird who cares
159:05
because when they start to die they'll
159:06
call you to pray for them
159:09
they'll look for you if it's on their
159:10
deathbed hey you know about heaven
159:13
i need to go there don't forget they
159:16
made fun of you
159:19
that's why it's important that you not
159:22
suffer
159:22
trauma for 30 years after it happened
159:26
you know who's doing that the devil
159:29
because you saw it or experienced it and
159:31
he will replay it and replay it stop
159:34
the video stop it stop it stop
159:38
it and lose it from your soul jesus and
159:41
after your will
159:41
because of jesus to lose it from your
159:43
soul he'll come down and pull it out
159:45
and it will literally be like it never
159:46
happened to you
159:48
i've seen too many people set free and
159:52
they went from being
159:53
you know in the drudges of despair
159:55
suicidal
159:56
they'd have these dreams every night
159:58
about the torment or whatever it was the
160:00
trauma they went through
160:01
and three minutes with me
160:04
and the revelation god gave me while
160:06
their husband their pastor went in the
160:08
store to get me some things to eat
160:09
i was invited to speak his wife was set
160:12
free she was a different person when he
160:13
came out
160:16
and then she brought her 17 year old and
160:18
her 11 eleven-year-old sons to me
160:20
because they were present when she was
160:21
abused so much they lose out all their
160:24
soul and they haven't
160:25
never six years later have never had
160:27
another nightmare or torment
160:33
you can be free the truth makes you free
160:37
and the truth is you can be free
160:42
even from heroin from witchcraft
160:48
homosexuality it doesn't matter what it
160:49
is from the enemy
160:52
you choose with your will to be free and
160:54
yes we pray for people to be free from
160:55
homosexuality
160:57
which is a spirit and guess what
161:00
they have powerful destinies every one
161:02
of them
161:04
the devil targets the ones
161:07
who have the greatest destinies to bring
161:10
freedom or liberty to people and he
161:12
wants to keep them from doing that so he
161:15
gets them distracted
161:16
sidetracked on the wrong path filled
161:19
with lies believing that's how god made
161:22
them but remember when he made them he
161:23
wrote on their soul
161:25
this is who you are this is what you
161:27
will be
161:29
and he had plans for them from that
161:30
moment i will tell you this there is a
161:32
move coming to them and millions of them
161:34
will get born again
161:35
[Applause]
161:35
[Music]
161:42
not not not just a few millions
161:45
he'll move on them they'll know who they
161:46
will they'll know the entire time it was
161:48
a lie
161:51
and they will repent from it reject it
161:53
completely and run
161:55
into god's kingdom
161:58
and they'll be great witnesses i will
162:01
also tell you this
162:02
millions of muslims are about to expect
162:05
they will experience salvation
162:15
god is still into saving people
162:19
number one thing make sure you belong to
162:22
him
162:24
if you get saved at least you're going
162:26
to have it
162:29
a lot of people have it happen on their
162:30
deathbed
162:32
and the family member said i never saw
162:33
it happen so you think it didn't happen
162:36
did you believe they would be because
162:39
the number
162:40
one thing besides getting jesus you
162:41
better believing that your family
162:42
members will know jesus christ
162:44
give their life to him and be with you
162:46
in heaven
162:48
there's a reason why you should do that
162:51
you have the greatest influence in the
162:52
spirit realm over their life
162:54
as family members
162:58
and jesus the first time he took me to
163:00
heaven said there'd be so many in the
163:01
earth to be shocked when they get there
163:02
to see who's up there
163:06
and yet they were the very one who
163:08
prayed and believed for their salvation
163:12
we have so many promises as a believer
163:18
we as the body of will see an example
163:23
a living walking breathing
163:26
taking authority dominion releasing life
163:29
to people
163:30
and let them see you happy and joyful
163:34
while you're doing it
163:37
maybe they might want jesus
163:41
one of the biggest things i know it will
163:43
happen eventually the world will know
163:44
us the body of christ by our what our
163:47
love for each other
163:50
stop fighting the plan of the enemy
163:55
divide and conquer is his plan
163:59
and in this whole last year several
164:02
years before the virus
164:06
it's not a plague
164:09
and it is not a disease even in the
164:12
natural
164:13
viruses come and they go
164:18
but people act like they are
164:22
i'm not saying you can't protect
164:23
yourself if you want to
164:25
i'm not tolerating sickness or disease
164:29
i'm not tolerating it every time you
164:32
bless your food i hope you're blessing
164:33
your food
164:34
i won't ask for a show of hands
164:39
my daddy let us eat after we blessed our
164:42
food
164:43
and then he added things the prayer went
164:45
on forever
164:49
i know where he got it from because when
164:50
his mom came off the mission field she
164:52
would have a 40-minute prayer at the
164:53
dinner
164:57
and she knew that open her eyes if
164:58
you're going to leave the table
165:01
and then she'd pray for you
165:05
blessing your food is a very powerful
165:07
thing
165:09
because it says when you do that and you
165:11
ask he will take sickness
165:13
far from you
165:15
[Music]
165:17
so if you haven't been doing it do it
165:20
that means he won't allow it to come to
165:23
you or your home that's what you've got
165:24
an interpretation
165:25
he won't allow it to come to you or your
165:27
home if you were declaring that
165:30
when i say my blessing is not 30 minutes
165:32
long but you know i added a few things
165:35
i will hold my plate up in the
165:36
restaurant or anywhere else look at
165:37
father doesn't this smell good
165:42
i'm going to enjoy every bite of it
165:45
so bless it to my body and may the isis
165:48
have a never-ending crisis
165:51
may hell have triple trouble in hell
165:54
as long as i'm alive i thank you for
165:58
blessing all those who serve you who
165:59
know you who
166:00
love you amen
166:05
so if we go out together after i'm
166:07
invited
166:08
and that pastor says will you bless the
166:10
food
166:11
who's ever with me will go okay
166:16
and what are they gonna do here i'm
166:18
picking up my plate are they gonna sit
166:20
there and just stare at theirs
166:21
lift it up everybody
166:24
[Applause]
166:25
i'm training you to bless your food
166:31
that you actually can have food and
166:33
actually can eat the food
166:37
amen many countries can't do that
166:40
but we can remember that the next time
166:43
somebody asks you to say blessing
166:46
i challenge you to do it do you know why
166:50
because it was a day when i was in my
166:53
late teens and i was saying my wrote
166:55
prayer
166:55
father thank you for this blessing he's
166:57
in my body and what's wrong with his
166:58
name my person thank you amen
167:00
did you even hear those words and i
167:03
literally heard from heaven this is
167:04
before he started taking me
167:06
i heard like a rubber stamp wham
167:10
500 billion 260 million
167:13
810 0001
167:16
can you say something else
167:21
that we might actually be excited to
167:23
hear he really said that to me
167:26
so from that day i have never
167:30
blessed my food like that
167:35
it's a habit that's not a blessing
167:40
that's not a blessing it's a habit right
167:45
you need to get god excited
167:49
father i thank you for this amazing food
167:51
it smells good looks good
167:53
i can't wait to see what you're going to
167:54
do with me next i am so
167:56
ready who cares what people hear
168:01
at least they'll know there's someone
168:02
around that knows god
168:07
my little sister gave her famous
168:09
blessing i think she was four or five
168:11
and we were all not
168:15
one of our other sisters i have eight
168:18
sisters and seven brothers
168:21
in an alligator named charlie but he's
168:23
in heaven he doesn't have to live in a
168:24
bathtub up
168:25
but i've seen him in heaven your pets
168:27
i'll go to heaven
168:31
be nice to them they'll remember you
168:41
and they'll talk
168:45
[Applause]
168:47
[Music]
168:50
and i already hear some people's heads
168:52
it's too late to tell me that's not true
168:54
you haven't been there because if you
168:56
did you would know that
168:58
why not did you know
169:02
that many animals actually have a spirit
169:04
and a soul
169:08
go back to genesis and read when
169:11
noah back in the day when my meetings
169:15
would be six hours long i'd do three or
169:17
four i was just like
169:18
like this and i would call let's see i
169:20
called them i have called noah moses
169:23
and adam and then one time i called him
169:26
noses
169:28
because my head was so tired i couldn't
169:32
remember
169:32
and every time i did that everybody
169:34
emailed me i don't think you know who
169:36
actually put people on the ark
169:39
and then we get phone calls and they go
169:40
yeah she knows she blew what
169:42
okay she knows this is moa and moses and
169:44
noah because you know she couldn't
169:45
really remember
169:48
if you go back and read that you know
169:49
what i'm telling this is what the father
169:51
told me
169:52
this is how he taught me like a little
169:53
kid because when i go to heaven i'm like
169:55
eight years old with pigtails
169:58
and he actually talks to all of you like
170:01
children
170:02
man is the one who likes to expound
170:06
and make things totally not even
170:09
understandable
170:11
or approachable
170:14
but god doesn't talk to us like that so
170:16
he talked me said i'm going to teach you
170:18
something
170:19
and why because i'd seen pets in heaven
170:21
and i'm like wow there's
170:23
every one of my pets they were in this
170:24
long line and they were on my father's
170:26
ranch in heaven
170:28
and they started with sally the pig and
170:30
i got i got corrected because i said
170:32
there was
170:32
pork in heaven i didn't say he ate the
170:34
pig
170:37
he was a family pet gave him to my
170:39
father when he was tight for the
170:40
ministry it was this big when it died it
170:41
was 1100 pounds
170:45
i saw her in heaven and her were two
170:47
little mice that we had in new york city
170:49
when you were allowed to have pets
170:50
they lived in the wall they were
170:51
residents so we just kept them
170:57
i recognized my brother joey's duck name
171:00
max that he had when he was nine charlie
171:03
the alligator
171:04
that i've always talked about we all had
171:06
in florida we live in florida
171:07
and he lived in our bathtub and we had
171:09
to take it out and clean the tub and
171:11
he'd wander around the bathroom
171:15
every goat bird fish
171:19
snake lots of them spiders and iguana
171:22
named iggy
171:23
i saw every single one of them in heaven
171:28
every one of them a long line as long as
171:29
you see following my dad
171:31
walking around on my dad's ranch
171:34
and the father took me to the store and
171:35
he said i need to explain this to you
171:37
because people will argue
171:38
and they're not god
171:42
so they think they know better than me
171:44
but if you go read
171:46
the scripture in genesis where i told
171:49
noah to put the animals on the
171:53
ark and then he took me further
171:57
you know even closer further away at the
172:00
beginning
172:01
of time when he made adam
172:04
and it talks about how you know god the
172:06
father and jesus were both there by the
172:08
way
172:09
the father said adam jesus stepped out
172:11
of him that's what the word always did
172:13
he stepped out and made his body
172:15
but there was no life in him until he
172:16
did one thing
172:18
the father leans over because the father
172:20
carries
172:21
life he leaned over and breathed
172:24
adam's spirit of life that was his
172:28
spirit man he breathed adam's spiritual
172:32
body
172:33
into his nostrils and he became a living
172:35
soul
172:36
and i went oh yeah i've always known
172:38
that
172:39
he said but you didn't never connect it
172:41
to noah go back and read this scripture
172:43
in genesis
172:45
and i did and do you know what it says
172:47
that god told noah to put every animal
172:49
on the ark
172:50
that had a spirit of life in it you
172:56
don't have to believe me believe the
172:57
word
172:58
that meant those creatures had souls
173:02
and a spirit body oh that's from god i
173:05
can't take credit
173:07
that's how revelation happens it changes
173:09
the way you think
173:10
so people will argue with you it's too
173:12
late it's in the word
173:15
so i don't think mosquitoes have a soul
173:16
i think they just they go die and go to
173:18
hell with the flies
173:29
they came from hell they can't have a
173:31
soul right
173:34
but i did learn that all your pets go to
173:37
heaven
173:38
and then when one would die i'd actually
173:40
see my angel take his spiritual body and
173:42
take it to heaven
173:43
your own guardian angel takes your pet's
173:45
spiritual body and takes it to heaven
173:47
and they live in your mansion
173:50
they will be eating at the table when
173:51
you get there
173:55
they will not be eating off the floor
173:56
anymore so
174:00
people go it doesn't say the word
174:02
animals are in heaven it says creatures
174:06
preach the gospel to who
174:10
what to what i preached the gospel to
174:13
every pe
174:14
i had i was gonna make sure they made it
174:19
creatures remember around the throne the
174:22
living
174:25
they have bodies like animals but
174:28
they're not
174:30
they're highly intelligent have always
174:32
been with god like melchizedek who had
174:35
no father no mother no beginning or ends
174:38
there was more than father son and holy
174:40
spirit i always say father word and holy
174:42
spirit
174:44
and so melchizedek has always been with
174:46
him he is father's personal high priest
174:48
thank you not one of adam's sons
174:52
he's not a human that died and went to
174:54
heaven
174:55
he's always been with him i've seen a
174:58
syllabus this big that tells you about
175:01
um what is it what is that one thing
175:02
they talk about well number one they
175:04
always talk about the stone god will
175:05
give you when you get to heaven
175:07
and you always see on the syllabus a
175:08
river rock with some big long name
175:11
because he will give you a nickname the
175:13
only he and you know
175:15
and that white rock is a white diamond
175:18
is not a river rock the word rock in
175:21
heaven means
175:22
gemstone because he's not cheap or poor
175:30
right when when you get married you give
175:33
your
175:34
the toes a ring with a diamond in it or
175:37
some beautiful stone right
175:39
he's old bran so get ready for your pets
175:44
to be in heaven
175:45
amen and they'll be with you for all
175:48
eternity so i keep telling people be
175:50
nice to them
175:51
they'll thank you for how often you let
175:53
them out
175:56
or fed them the food under the table you
175:58
weren't supposed to
175:59
why do you think they tried to eat it
176:01
off of the table later when you're not
176:02
there
176:04
you spoiled them
176:10
so when he said heaven is beyond
176:11
anything you ever thought or imagined
176:15
it is unless
176:18
i like the word unless it be revealed by
176:21
his spirit
176:23
so the spirit of god is the one who
176:24
catches me up all the time
176:26
without warning me i fall in the
176:28
driveway i'll go to heaven
176:29
i'm in the grocery store reaching for
176:30
something he takes me to heaven my
176:32
family know because they'll come in to
176:33
talk to me and there's nothing in me
176:35
this
176:36
my spirit man's in heaven holy spirit
176:39
climbs and keeps my body alive
176:41
my husband is so used to it of 43 years
176:44
he'll come in and say something to me i
176:46
don't hear him i'm in heaven i don't
176:47
look down and watch what people are
176:48
doing
176:49
are you kidding i'm listening to what
176:50
god is showing me
176:52
but my husband will say these words oh
176:55
i'll come back later
177:00
he is he is scottish he's not moved by
177:03
anything
177:05
even as his wife's body is sitting there
177:07
not breathing
177:10
he is not concerned
177:14
see he picked the right person for me
177:20
i remember the first day he saw an angel
177:21
walking down our hallway
177:25
and he freaked out although i've talked
177:28
about them thousands of times he
177:29
actually saw one he's like
177:35
nothing would come out
177:39
i said oh did you see the angel
177:45
he never doubted he just never you don't
177:48
sit there and cry because he doesn't get
177:49
to go
177:50
he's happy i go and he's happy i speak
177:54
don't ask him if he wants the mic you'll
177:57
get a joke
177:59
and it will be a scottish silk that
178:00
you'll never get the ending to
178:02
you'll never get the punchline
178:06
but if you ever want to fish and catch
178:09
big fish
178:12
that is a gift god gave him when he sent
178:14
him from himself he made him a fisherman
178:17
that's his passion that's his greatest
178:19
thing besides me and jesus
178:20
and guess what i hate
178:24
i hate fish let willy be free
178:28
i don't want him in my freezer in my
178:30
home in a frying pan or on my table
178:34
they're slimy they stink they smell and
178:36
i don't like i don't like them
178:40
so if i went fishing he'd have to take
178:42
it off he'd still be here the jesus game
178:45
and i'm not touching that fish and do
178:47
you think god knew this
178:48
of course he knew it of course
178:52
he gave somebody somebody with five
178:53
layers in their soul
178:55
that's like a rock and you aren't ever
178:59
changing that man i'm glad he knows
179:01
jesus that's all i can say
179:04
loves jesus he hears very clearly gives
179:07
me words from god all the time a little
179:08
scratches of paper
179:10
but doesn't talk about it so he gave me
179:13
somebody who doesn't care about talking
179:15
or want to talk thank god right because
179:17
we'd be wearing each other out
179:20
i pray for people spouses want to see
179:22
they both minister
179:24
and they're wanting the microphone
179:30
[Applause]
179:33
i have no competition
179:42
yeah well my sister kind of makes up for
179:43
her
179:45
the baby who said she'd never talk to
179:47
anybody but
179:48
but taught 15. uh-huh how many kids you
179:51
haven't used to class
179:53
16 two-year-olds for about 15 years
179:56
now she's braver than me i don't want to
180:00
do that
180:02
i don't want to catch fish and i don't
180:04
want that either
180:06
but she's really good at so that's why
180:08
she's writing all the children's books
180:10
and they're amazing our artist is every
180:12
time he gets time he works on it
180:15
every child around the world will know
180:16
there is a heaven there is a god
180:19
and what life is like there and the last
180:21
place i was taken that was new was
180:23
called whimsical way
180:26
it's up in the celestial realm the sky
180:28
of heaven and any little child who wants
180:30
to in heaven
180:30
either climbs into a bubble gets on the
180:32
bubble train
180:35
and takes him up to this amazing place
180:37
parents don't have to go
180:39
and they have all these creatures little
180:41
creatures that are their friends
180:43
and one day we'll they'll be part of our
180:45
amusement park we've made
180:47
so heaven has got lots of plans for kids
180:50
fun you're probably one of the first
180:52
congregations i told this to
180:54
it was amazing these little creatures
180:56
had names they were wearing clothes they
180:57
were friends to these other kids
181:00
and they would all go up there whenever
181:01
they want to
181:03
and play and play and play and have fun
181:06
create little things and then they come
181:08
back down because you live with your
181:10
parents or your grandparents or whoever
181:11
is the closest
181:13
in relation to you when you get to
181:14
heaven no child is left alone
181:19
we should celebrate who we are
181:22
that is your destiny and the new
181:26
earth i get a lot of flack from that get
181:29
over it
181:31
you're not god he's going to make a and
181:34
say new
181:36
say new means new he's already remodeled
181:40
this one several times already
181:42
he has yeah and when you get to heaven
181:45
everybody gets to see when he made it
181:48
you all learn how he made the earth the
181:50
first time
181:52
how it got messed up in verse two think
181:55
about it verse one verse two
181:58
how did that happen so quick in the
182:00
beginning god created the heavens and
182:02
the earth that means it was done
182:04
say don imperfect then wine number two
182:08
is it a mess
182:11
why is the water on the land and the sky
182:14
why is it trapped underneath all that
182:16
stuff
182:18
why is the earth all split up why is it
182:20
in darkness
182:23
the first one he didn't need the sun or
182:25
the moon yet he made him yet
182:28
no he lit it with his glory
182:32
we should study the book of jeremiah he
182:35
turned the light out at one time
182:38
satan was making the earth a wilderness
182:43
rick not me knows
182:46
but really when he made it the first
182:47
time it was perfect
182:49
and he lit it with his glory there was
182:52
no evil on the earth
182:55
at that time and then of course you all
182:58
know
182:59
satan lucifer was cast out of heaven
183:01
down to the earth
183:02
and he thought he was going to take over
183:03
he's tried so many times i don't know
183:04
why he didn't give up
183:07
but the dinosaurs became evil because
183:09
they got possessed and used and
183:11
i know people talk about i don't know
183:12
where they get these things from
183:14
reptilian seed because god made the
183:16
donors dinosaurs not satan
183:18
oh you don't even want to know about the
183:19
reptile you don't need to know about
183:21
okay it doesn't have anything to do with
183:22
us
183:24
man comes up with their own head
183:25
knowledge and understanding
183:27
of something and there are no nephilim
183:30
on the earth right now i assure you
183:33
there aren't any
183:37
so there's too much really to talk about
183:39
all that you've already got what you
183:40
really needed when
183:41
the first 15-20 minutes
183:45
you have revelation that a lot of people
183:47
don't know what's going to happen
183:49
you heard like uh i know 24-year plan
183:53
but really actually heard about a
183:54
50-year plan
183:56
i've been taking over 100 years into the
183:58
future and the earth was still here
184:01
and it was good
184:05
it was really good each generation until
184:09
god is ready to stop things
184:11
it'll get stronger they will manifest
184:14
more
184:15
they'll be in charge more and children
184:17
will probably be the first ones who
184:19
command a mountain to jump into the sea
184:21
and if they want to put it back they
184:22
will
184:24
because we go from where
184:28
this is not glory to glory glory to
184:30
glory
184:31
glory to glory this is us now glory to
184:34
the pit
184:35
glory to the pit glory to depression
184:38
glory to lack
184:39
glory to lack that isn't the way it goes
184:44
it goes from glory to glory to
184:48
glory that is an upward motion in
184:50
authority in dominion in joy and
184:53
celebration
184:54
and the earth being well
184:57
a hundred years from now it will be like
184:59
that so forget
185:01
stop trying to make plans to escape i
185:04
don't want to escape
185:05
i want to be here i'll be here the whole
185:07
time
185:09
and the people well jesus comes
185:11
tribulation comes it's all over no it's
185:12
not you don't know the bible
185:14
because jesus gets he will get his
185:16
thousand-year reign
185:18
and god's not keeping that from him why
185:20
would he
185:21
he's going to sit on that throne in
185:23
jerusalem and be king of the world
185:26
for a thousand years and it's still not
185:27
over
185:29
because satan will be in a big pit oh
185:32
yeah
185:33
there will be no weapons on the earth
185:34
during that thousand years people will
185:36
live to be seven and eight hundred years
185:38
old
185:39
because christ is sitting on the throne
185:42
and there'll still be people who aren't
185:43
saved
185:45
so that means people will make it
185:46
through the tribulation the whole earth
185:48
will not be destroyed in the tribulation
185:51
and everybody won't be killed off the
185:53
earth as there'd be no natural people
185:55
for jesus to rule over when he sits on
185:58
that zone in jerusalem at the end of the
185:59
tribulation
186:00
right yeah who's he going to rule who's
186:03
he going to be in charge of
186:04
and there'll be kings and countries that
186:06
don't want him there can you believe
186:07
that they must have the
186:09
let's be unintelligent i'll be polite
186:13
it's not what my flesh wanted to say
186:15
they will be as
186:16
unintelligent as the devil
186:19
they will not want him and they'll know
186:20
he's the son of god
186:22
i mean he just wiped up all the all the
186:25
wicked evil armies right
186:28
he won like trump won
186:32
not that he's god but look at him he won
186:34
and he thought this is going to be easy
186:36
breezy
186:37
and never has every devil around come
186:40
after somebody
186:42
so harshly they hate him because he
186:45
stands for justice liberty and freedom
186:48
but they really hated him
186:51
when he became really dangerous and said
186:53
i'm fighting god back in january
186:56
that was it
186:59
that was it the devil went crazy
187:03
he's not going to stay in that seat
187:07
i'll impeach him i declare i'm
187:10
incompetent
187:11
other people rise up all over you know
187:13
what they want a civil war here for a
187:14
long time
187:16
they want all of us to run the streets
187:17
and kill each other and i've told them
187:20
i've talked to them sometimes do you not
187:23
understand a true american
187:25
they actually want life they want a
187:28
future
187:29
they have a family they don't want your
187:31
garbage
187:33
go to a third world country and live if
187:35
you want socialism go where they have
187:37
dominism
187:39
we're not going to have it here why the
187:41
people don't want it
187:43
[Music]
187:46
you don't want it and they'll make it
187:48
sound like it's amazing
187:52
make it sound like it's beautiful go to
187:53
venezuela
187:55
they're living in dumpsters if they can
187:57
find one
187:59
that's what happens i grew up
188:03
because of my natural age i've been
188:05
through many generations of time on the
188:08
earth
188:09
i remember the turmoil of the 60s when
188:11
people wanted to have nothing but love
188:13
and
188:14
or war then they didn't want to go to
188:15
war
188:17
they didn't want to do nothing
188:20
i remember that but i also remember
188:22
doing we would do
188:23
these what do you call them when you
188:24
have to do little
188:28
see my earth mine doesn't work so well
188:30
not projects it's when you would hide
188:31
under your desk in case the russians are
188:33
coming to get you
188:35
anybody here have to do that
188:40
you were practicing if you were going to
188:43
be bombed by the russians
188:45
what's called the cold war it's pretty
188:48
cold on that floor under my desk
188:51
and when i was like eight nine ten they
188:53
all did it they'd they'd stop
188:56
and they would let the alarm go
188:57
everybody would just
188:59
buy habit oh drop what you're doing
189:01
crawl under your desk and hide
189:03
in case the bomb would hit
189:06
we lived like that until it was ended
189:12
okay so you don't want to live in russia
189:14
i've been there
189:16
the sadness is so horrific
189:20
i didn't i didn't get off the ship to go
189:22
unsure i could
189:23
feel it and see it like black clouds of
189:26
evil
189:28
and that i could feel with the people
189:30
with a great deep sadness and grief
189:33
that they had no freedom
189:36
because if they take your weapons
189:39
the criminals aren't going to give up
189:41
theirs
189:43
you wonder where their heads are right
189:46
and who
189:46
in the world wants to do well i know
189:48
this is political well you have to give
189:49
it up because tomorrow that's what
189:50
you're really going to get
189:54
god is very politically minded
189:57
he doesn't want that he only wants that
190:00
who in the right mind shows you they
190:02
probably don't have one anymore
190:04
wants to defund the police
190:09
i'd be amazed if anyone who lived in
190:11
california
190:12
or washington or oregon or
190:15
new york chicago
190:18
i could just go down this list who in
190:20
their mind
190:21
having had no freedom for five months
190:26
would vote in that same governor
190:30
or the senators or the people who didn't
190:33
care if their places were being
190:34
destroyed
190:37
where does that come from
190:42
i promise you i won't tell you some
190:44
things the president's going to do as
190:45
soon as he gets reelected
190:48
he'll be tweaking some governors i'll
190:50
just say that much and some mayors
190:54
and getting laws changed
190:55
[Music]
190:59
because people even the ones who voted
191:01
him and don't
191:03
want them now because they who won't
191:06
allow
191:07
are having all the freedom they want to
191:08
do what they want to
191:10
and they're openly showing what's in
191:12
their soul that's the point of all this
191:15
god is exposing the souls of people
191:18
and they can hide and smile behind their
191:20
big office
191:21
but when it comes push to shove what's
191:24
in that soul is coming out and people
191:27
couldn't believe it when it started
191:28
happening what is wrong with those
191:30
people are they insane
191:32
because their people don't have liberty
191:33
freedom and there is no justice there is
191:35
no protection
191:37
there's no food there's no jobs people's
191:40
houses get broken into when they want to
191:41
do you know how many people i want to
191:42
tell you how many people have moved to
191:45
florida
191:47
we are being crushed with people every
191:50
day
191:51
because they were seeing us on the news
191:54
having liberty freedom and justice
191:58
enjoying our beaches
192:02
we were as good as we could be to work
192:04
along with the quarantine
192:06
but we had fresh air everywhere we went
192:08
you could open your door and have fresh
192:09
air
192:10
and people saw that and went i'm not
192:12
staying here no more so they're moving
192:13
out
192:15
and that should obviously we think would
192:17
show the head of that person who's in
192:19
charge
192:20
they don't like this they're leaving
192:23
that means no votes
192:26
now no one's going to want to vote them
192:27
back in you want to go through that
192:30
again
192:32
and no tax money you're right no tax
192:34
money to take care of anything
192:37
it's a mess
192:41
it's all free if they say give it up
192:44
give it all there give it all to us
192:46
we'll just take care of you don't even
192:48
think that's what's going to happen
192:51
you gave away your destiny your future
192:53
your home your rights
192:55
your rights your rights your rights
192:58
ask what satan wants
193:02
but he's not going to get away with it
193:03
here say where to go
193:14
so people have a lot of questions they'd
193:16
like to ask me
193:17
and we'd be here for 10 more hours
193:21
and i wouldn't be sleeping
193:25
people always invite me then if they
193:27
ever ask me to visit their home
193:30
they try so hard to stay up while i'm up
193:32
and they're like falling asleep
193:34
sitting next to me wanting to ask i
193:36
don't do that anymore by the way
193:38
i've actually spoken in i'm trying to
193:41
remember the name of that great black
193:42
university
193:44
it's either maryland or washington dc i
193:47
actually got to go speak there
193:51
oh yeah george washington university
193:53
yeah i did i was invited and they
193:54
couldn't squeeze the people they
193:56
couldn't get them they gave us a small
193:57
room then bigger room a bigger room
193:58
because the students asked for it
194:01
and they have to say yes and they had so
194:04
many crammed in there you couldn't
194:06
hardly breathe
194:07
and the next night there was even more
194:10
and i was staying in the home of this
194:11
family
194:12
nobody could stay up they're like i
194:15
gotta go to sleep
194:18
and i'm still sitting here
194:22
you know in heaven you don't have to
194:23
sleep
194:25
people go i always wanted a bedroom done
194:27
a certain way well you'll get it
194:30
he'll make it for you to make you happy
194:32
it'll be your lounge room
194:35
your meditation room you don't need to
194:39
meditate when you're living with the one
194:40
that you meditate about
194:46
your mansions are amazing some are under
194:50
the crystal sea somewhere up in the
194:52
skies of heaven
194:54
they have a rain forest in heaven these
194:57
12
194:57
massive trees that could hold some i've
194:59
seen mansions the size of new york city
195:01
one one mansion probably belonged to an
195:05
intercessor
195:08
seriously somebody you never knew or
195:10
heard of
195:12
you know they prayed in every move of
195:13
god until they were going on they're
195:15
probably still praying when they were
195:16
leaving
195:18
and i like to tell these young people
195:20
you may be living your life you want to
195:21
but if you have a grandma in heaven
195:24
she's going to pray the fire of god down
195:26
on you
195:28
to send the angels of heaven to pursue
195:30
you
195:32
and talk to the holy spirit non-stop
195:36
you may as well get up here roll over
195:37
and lay down and give up right now
195:39
because they're going to get you
195:43
you'll listen to the prayers of your
195:44
grandma
195:46
i was in a where it was a fireman's sub
195:49
i'll talk anywhere
195:51
and somebody made a comment about my
195:52
hair which god picked not me
195:54
i did not pick this thing here i was not
195:57
a pink hair person oh no remember i was
195:58
the one that wanted to just hide
196:00
i want to be invisible i was okay with
196:02
being invisible he said you're not going
196:04
to be invisible you're not going to be
196:05
hiding anymore that's what he said to me
196:07
we need you to have pink highlights in
196:09
your hair
196:13
now i had probably about 40 pastor
196:14
friends in my city and then they thought
196:16
that was it i went over the edge
196:19
knowing me not changed but my pink hair
196:22
made it impossible to
196:23
to be friends with what is wrong with
196:27
these people oh
196:28
they have no clue they're they're in the
196:30
flesh not the spirit
196:32
this is a spirit test if you don't like
196:36
it you're in the flesh
196:37
you like it you're walking in the spirit
196:44
so i don't ask for it but you can't hide
196:47
so everywhere i go and pastors go i
196:49
can't invite you
196:50
my congregation would freak out if they
196:51
saw your pink hair i said you just
196:53
didn't know how many hours they watched
196:55
of me on youtube and guess what they
196:56
come to my meetings at the church
196:58
next door to you
197:01
i don't think they're not the ones who
197:03
aren't ready
197:06
i think it's you
197:15
so because of this pink hair it opens up
197:18
me to speak about heaven everywhere
197:20
everywhere everywhere all day
197:22
all day no matter where it is it's even
197:25
happened here
197:26
already it doesn't matter people are
197:28
attracted to it while your hair is
197:29
amazing yeah the pastor should hear that
197:31
right
197:32
get your evangelistic team to get
197:34
color-colored highlights in their hair
197:36
and send them out into the streets and
197:37
see how many people they can draw
197:44
it's great marketing
197:48
and so they will say hey your hair is
197:49
cool yeah this is heaven culture
197:52
what does that mean that means i know
197:54
god he asked me to have pink hands in
197:56
his hair i've been to heaven they all
197:57
have highlights
197:59
what and they never say this you're
198:02
lying
198:04
this is what a non-believer
198:07
no matter how on drugs whatever it is
198:09
they'll go what did it look like
198:15
you know their souls kind of loosened up
198:16
because they've been taking something
198:19
and what's in there will come out what
198:22
did it look like
198:23
i've had meetings at the cashier where
198:25
the lines backing up then they're
198:27
listening the bad boys are listening the
198:29
bad boys at the next one cashier comes
198:31
over so they can hear
198:32
well i'm saying it's because of this
198:34
thing here so i understand jesus when he
198:36
said we need you to have pink highlights
198:38
in your hair
198:39
and he can read my thoughts and i'm
198:40
thinking in my head
198:42
why and he looked at me and says it's
198:46
if the lord of glory ever says to you
198:49
with all the love he has his heart it's
198:51
necessary
198:52
i don't care what he wants then he just
198:55
keeps he keeps going
198:57
we don't want you to be hidden you can't
198:59
hide anymore
199:01
we're going to market heaven with that
199:02
pink hair
199:04
we want people to know the truth we want
199:06
to know it's not boring it's exciting
199:08
it's powerful it's amazing
199:09
i want you to know as a believer the
199:11
authority and dominion that you have in
199:13
this earth
199:14
and it's okay if you color highlights in
199:16
your hair you look like heaven
199:20
angels are different colors they're not
199:22
just all
199:23
pasty white glowing with white wings in
199:25
a white gown
199:28
some would probably make you crawl under
199:29
your seat they have a band around their
199:31
head with eyes and that whole band
199:34
they have they have this this whatever
199:36
thing they call this thing
199:39
a breastplate thank you yes they have
199:42
eyes all through them
199:44
in the front and the back their wings
199:46
are made out of electricity or lightning
199:50
their faces are angular their eyes are
199:52
diamond shaped
199:54
if one comes in your room it's not from
199:56
hell
199:58
and some of them can look really fierce
200:00
really fears like i have two heads
200:03
one facing this way one facing that way
200:06
they both look front and back no matter
200:08
where they're turning they can see
200:10
some are weapons they don't need to
200:12
carry weapons
200:14
i'm more acquainted with the army of
200:16
heaven than gabriel's group
200:18
i've seen gabriel's group i know my
200:20
guardian angel i've known him since i
200:22
was little he's 40 feet high
200:24
i won't tell you his name ask god
200:29
would you tell me what my angel's name
200:31
is so i could say thank you
200:33
you're not worshiping him and they won't
200:35
let you worship them
200:37
and an army doesn't get worshipped they
200:38
want commands
200:41
they need orders like this army
200:46
they have generals they have privates
200:48
they have commanders
200:50
all kind of levels in the army itself
200:54
but we get to command because jesus
200:56
christ did
200:58
they were made for us to command they
201:01
don't protect heaven
201:03
not one angel there's not one angel
201:06
building is not
201:06
one was designed to protect heaven from
201:09
who
201:13
from who the army didn't even get to
201:16
throw them all
201:17
out michael held him while god zapped
201:21
him with a lightning bolt from himself
201:23
it says i saw a satan fall as lightning
201:26
well one third of the angels went right
201:28
behind him
201:31
he kicked them all out that was his um
201:36
intolerance no tolerance for evil
201:40
or wickedness he doesn't want us to
201:45
tolerate it either your words your deeds
201:48

in the assemblies of god we got saved
205:24
every week
205:26
we did
205:30
whether we needed to or not we still got
205:32
saved
205:34
oh the baptist did it all the time
205:35
they're doing everybody's neighborhood
205:36
in their yard it doesn't matter
205:38
the baptists are great soul winners
205:40
y'all
205:42
they really are they're very bold
205:48
but don't let the watchtower people come
205:50
in your home
205:56
don't want to give you their watchtower
205:57
magazine burn it
206:00
or shred it it's false religion
206:04
all false religions are run by one
206:06
person that satan
206:08
is called an antichrist spirit remember
206:10
jesus talked about it
206:11
that means anything is against christ's
206:13
sovereignty
206:15

206:19
his his anything who's against that that
206:21

carpenter's home church what was the
206:59
name of the church in orlando
207:03
calvary assembly of god i was there
207:06
invited with a lot of other prophets who
207:08
were
207:08
taken out of their box because jeff
207:10
jensen was in charge
207:12
and he never has a program or a schedule
207:15
you flow with him
207:16
so all these great leaders are all
207:18
sitting up on the platform and
207:20
and jeff would just say all right get up
207:21
there and start speaking and they're
207:23
like
207:23
they'd look at me because i'm a friend
207:25
right he made me sit beside him or
207:27
behind him
207:28

207:31
here's mike go go say something and they
207:33

done night i think it was released that
207:49

208:07
the spirit of god
208:10
it was a lot of fun it was powerful but
208:12
most of them didn't know me
208:14

00:34
do you believe
00:44
[Music]
00:52
[Music]
00:56
superhero
00:58
[Music]
01:06
and he will win
01:15
[Applause]
01:17
this is a part of time appointed by me
01:22
from heaven
01:27
this night i light a flame
01:30
on the top of this mountain it will
01:33
never be
01:34
put out
01:39
for you have stood through adversity
01:43
through the lies to the accusations
01:48
through the control the demands of man
01:52
you have worshipped me
01:56
you have not forgotten my son you have
01:59
not forgotten what he's done
02:02
you will be blessed and you will never
02:05
stop being blessed
02:09
for i am the god of everybody
02:13
and the god of everything i'm about to
02:16
shake this
02:17
earth great exposure of the darkness
02:22
[Music]
02:22
[Applause]
02:26
no matter what people or the fake news
02:30
or the lying liberals have said about me
02:34
or this time they don't
02:38
know anything
02:41
[Music]
02:45
if they do not stop they will lose
02:48
everything
02:51
their words will become dust and blown
02:54
away like they were never there
02:58
for i say this is a time of greatness
03:01
of acceleration you've never known and
03:04
the manifested sons and daughters
03:08
to come forth to demonstrate to manifest
03:12
my power my love
03:17
my plans
03:20
[Music]
03:22
the devil has plans he will fail
03:27
and he will lose again and again
03:31
and again and again
03:34
and again and again
03:39
[Music]
03:41
for i have already said i will be in the
03:44
white house for 24
03:46
years
03:47
[Music]
03:48
[Applause]
03:49
[Music]
03:53
there is no one on this earth in this
03:56
earth
03:57
under this earth that can stop it from
03:59
happening
04:02
for i will have these days on the earth
04:05
the great days
04:07
the great days of knowing there is a god
04:11
that he speaks that he sears sees and
04:14
hears
04:19
if my prophets do not prophesy what i
04:22
say
04:23
they will not have a voice until that
04:25
season is over
04:28
for these are not the days of doom and
04:30
gloom
04:31
these are not the days of the rapture
04:33
the perilous times the tribulation
04:38
they're times of greatness
04:42
of the fire and the glory sweeping over
04:45
this earth touching everyone
04:49
crushing the darkness and pushing it
04:51
back
04:54
for i am cleaning the stage
04:58
wiping it clean are the enemies camp
05:01
are the enemies people are the enemies
05:04
dust
05:05
[Music]
05:07
for i will have my way my son made a way
05:13
i will not ignore what he has done and i
05:16
will not have a weak pathetic testimony
05:18
of his sacrifice
05:23
no one says when he is coming back but
05:27
me
05:28
and i am not ready
05:32
for i will set you on fire
05:35
and you will demonstrate like no one has
05:38
before in all of history
05:41
the powerful things of god to speak to
05:43
the land the sea in the air
05:45
and it will move
05:48
do not tolerate evil and do not
05:50
participate with
05:52
it you choose life or death
05:57
because they are apparently out there
05:59
right now
06:01
always choose life
06:04
for when you side with those who want
06:06
death of the unburn
06:09
you will never win you will never
06:13
succeed or complete your destiny
06:16
you will repent
06:20
because i bring life and life abundantly
06:25
but you must choose it and if you choose
06:28
it
06:28
you must live it
06:32
get out of the gray area stop riding on
06:36
the fence
06:38
for i hear those who've humbled
06:40
themselves whose heart cries out for
06:43
more
06:45
but this time you get to bring them more
06:50
[Music]
06:54
i said it would be my sons and daughters
06:57
who did it
06:59
there is no age for them whether it's
07:02
three
07:04
or 153
07:08
you choose
07:11
for if you sit on the side and do
07:12
nothing that's what you will have
07:16
a boring life an unfruitful life
07:19
be bold and step out let people know
07:23
what you believe
07:24
and who you believe
07:27
they'll come beating your door down to
07:29
find out about your god
07:32
not the false gods who have no life
07:36
not the lies of the enemy he thinks he
07:39
can take
07:40
my country for it is mine
07:45
i created it i called it into being
07:49
i had people fight for it and die
07:52
for it in the seasons past
07:56
you've died to live for me but it now
08:00
you will live and not die if you choose
08:06
was it what is it to you if i
08:09
keep you until my son returns
08:15
be strong be excited
08:20
and celebrate the victory even before it
08:24
happens
08:29
do not listen to the doom and gloom
08:32
that does not come from me
08:36
but fearful hearts that don't know what
08:38
time it is
08:40
they don't know what my plans are and
08:42
they want to escape
08:48
run your race but run it with me
08:55
for i'll be right beside you
08:58
and i will open the eyes of many and
09:01
they will see me
09:03
and they will know their god those who
09:06
have stood and been faithful
09:09
even under attack even though things
09:10
were taken from you
09:12
do you not think i can give you a
09:14
hundred times more than what you had
09:20
it is my desire to bless you
09:23
it is my desire to be with you
09:29
for there are times there are only in
09:33
the power of my hand
09:36
and these are some of those times
09:43
listen to what is true where there is no
09:46
confusion
09:48
and nothing hidden
09:51
don't believe the lies of those who live
09:53
in sin and say they live and speak for
09:56
me
09:58
someone will remove from the earth
10:00
[Music]
10:01
i won't allow their testimony of who i
10:04
am to be here
10:10
many who are lying cheating and stealing
10:13
and even killing
10:14
will lose not just their seat but their
10:18
life
10:22
this is a holy time but it is a time
10:25
to celebrate
10:28
heaven celebrates with this time
10:32
live on earth like they live in heaven
10:37
but you have to be willing and
10:40
obedient
10:43
the host will not listen to those
10:46
to be commanded by those who do not
10:49
speak the words of my son
10:51
nor have him in their heart not just
10:55
as their savior but as their king
11:00
many kings will come forth in this time
11:04
for my son is the king of spiritual
11:07
kings
11:08
and the lord of spiritual lords in the
11:14
spirit there is no difference
11:15
between male nor female
11:20
both can rise to that position of
11:23
authority and dominion
11:26
but you have to pursue it
11:30
and if you want my thoughts you better
11:34
walk in my ways
11:37
and you better say his will
11:42
his way not his will
11:45
man's way
11:49
i'm about to consume this country
11:54
and people will come here to find me not
11:58
just the american dream
12:04
some regions the light and the glory
12:06
will be so great in
12:07
people will drive their dead relatives
12:10
in there they'll come to life
12:12
[Music]
12:16
neither sin nor crime nor sickness will
12:19
be able to abide in those regions
12:24
you are forerunners it is an honor and a
12:27
privilege to be chosen
12:31
if you're alive and you're breathing
12:34
and you've given yourself to my son you
12:37
are chosen
12:44
know this night that your god has
12:46
visited you
12:48
and spoken his words to you
12:53
if they don't light up with others then
12:56
do not receive those words
12:59
for i stand on my word
13:03
and beside my son on my throne
13:08
these are days we have talked about
13:11
before you were ever
13:12
born before the earth was made we spoke
13:15
of these days
13:17
why would i give them up
13:26
if you buy a bible and it says it's my
13:29
word and it's left parts out
13:31
don't read it
13:35
if it makes it easy to live to freely
13:38
sin
13:40
there's the gods beside me that can
13:43
bring you to my home
13:45
those are lies from hell
13:49
for my word and my truth
13:52
will make you free
13:55
says your god amen and amen
14:02
[Music]
14:04
[Applause]
14:05
[Music]
14:23
[Music]
14:28
oh
14:30
[Music]
14:38
can you hear me now
14:54
[Music]
14:55
i know there are people who will tell
14:57
you that you cannot see the faces of god
15:00
and live
15:02
but even the one who spoke those words
15:05
and they were written in the word
15:07
saw the face of god
15:10
john himself in the book of john said
15:13
you cannot see the face of god and live
15:16
but in the book of revelation in chapter
15:19
4
15:20
he was caught up
15:25
he was in the spirit
15:28
that's a place you walk in
15:34
he was in a place on that day where he
15:36
could hear no word of man
15:39
on the isle of patmos at least that day
15:43
unless he decided to walk off of it
15:48
i chose to let him see things are
15:52
different
16:03
because he was in that place i could
16:05
catch him up
16:07
and stand before my throne with the
16:10
living rainbow moving in and out of me
16:14
with life moving in and out of me
16:18
and he saw my face and never again after
16:22
that did he
16:24
say you cannot see the face of god and
16:27
live
16:30
for i have caught many up and showed
16:32
many my face
16:34
my plans but this one's standing before
16:39
you
16:40
she is my revelator i will never
16:44
stop taking her to heaven what business
16:47
is it to you if i want to
16:51
i hold the air you breathe
16:54
if i choose somebody
16:57
who's been willing and obedient and laid
17:00
down in their life
17:02
every time i asked
17:09
why would i not trust her
17:13
yes she's a woman and she's a king in
17:17
the spirit
17:20
[Applause]
17:24
she's not just my servant she is my
17:27
daughter
17:30
and it is my great pleasure to reveal
17:33
her
17:33
as my treasure to operate without
17:36
measure in these days
17:39
[Music]
17:42
if you're willing to pay the price
17:47
you think it's so easy
17:51
to have to live a halfway normal life on
17:53
this earth
17:54
when you're so connected to me in heaven
17:59
she does not see
18:00
things like you see them
18:05
but she will reveal everything i show
18:07
her
18:09
and will not be afraid of the face of
18:11
man
18:13
even hell trembles when she speaks
18:18
[Applause]
18:21
everyone should be dangerous against
18:26
hell
18:29
it is evil and wickedness that tries to
18:32
consume your country
18:34
but i will not tolerate it for my people
18:38
have humbled themselves
18:42
they have repented of their wicked ways
18:46
and i will heal their land
18:49
[Music]
18:54
for i hear everyone and i see everyone
18:58
nothing is hidden
18:59
from me
19:02
when i look at the earth i rejoice
19:09
i remember when my son and i made it
19:13
we made it to kerry the glory
19:16
the power the
19:23
a wonder station before you come home
19:36
i know your trials i know your test
19:41
if you fall down get up
19:44
[Applause]
19:49
tell the enemy you will no longer
19:50
tolerate him in your life
19:53
that means you will not tolerate his
19:55
images his words
19:57
his frequencies his songs
20:07
you create a habitation for heaven in
20:10
your home
20:12
and it will come
20:16
you will see angels coming and going
20:24
for you are in a new season
20:28
the season of the high call of god of
20:30
your god
20:34
why did you not expect for things to be
20:37
exposed
20:39
before every great thing was done hell
20:42
always acted up
20:47
but this time the exposure is for your
20:49
benefit
20:52
these are not new things they've always
20:54
been here
20:55
you just never knew it
20:59
i'm pulling away every closed door
21:03
basement building
21:06
things hidden in the wilderness things
21:09
hidden in the forest
21:11
even things hidden underground i will
21:13
expose it all
21:16
[Applause]
21:23
the lives of those those who want to
21:26
stand and run your country
21:29
but hate me hate life
21:33
even hate the people they want to govern
21:36
it will not happen
21:45
for i will shake them
21:48
and nothing will be hidden but openly
21:52
shown and dealt with
21:55
even those have already been in power
21:57
and think they've gotten away with it
21:59
[Applause]
22:02
[Music]
22:03
they will not
22:12
trump may not be perfect
22:16
but he gives me permission
22:21
to be in this country from the highest
22:25
office in the land he has welcomed me
22:29
and prayed to me and made friends with
22:32
my pastors
22:34
my prophets my teachers my evangelists
22:41
his closest friends are my sons and
22:43
daughters
22:46
but the world would reject them and hate
22:48
them
22:51
there are many people in this world
22:52
praying for your president
22:55
even they love him even they recognize
22:59
the good in him the authority in him
23:04
he will help to shift many leaders of
23:06
many governments
23:08
so i can shape that nation
23:15
and he will sweep his platform clean one
23:18
day
23:19
to make room for pence
23:23
i have heard words spoken against my
23:26
vice president and i am not happy
23:31
he is a godly man who is not afraid of
23:35
anything
23:38
he is a strong tower to temper your
23:48
president
23:50
he will win two terms also
23:53
[Music]
23:56
[Applause]
24:01
for i have written that in my book and
24:03
what my book says
24:05
it will happen not maybe happen
24:08
[Music]
24:08
[Applause]
24:11
whoever he picks to be his vice
24:13
president will then be president for
24:15
eight years after him
24:19
by that time there'll be no opposition
24:21
that will even have a voice to speak
24:23
[Music]
24:24
[Applause]
24:29
america will be a great light to this
24:31
world
24:35
it is my gift to this world
24:40
who allows my son my greatest gift to
24:42
operate in this world
24:47
get ready because the show is beginning
25:00
[Music]
25:12
there's coming a day when people will
25:14
step into
25:16
a store thinking they're going to buy
25:17
something
25:19
and they will step into my glory and
25:21
begin to cry out to know me
25:30
satan knows about these days
25:34
but he was hoping he could stop them
25:44
this is a place of freedom liberty and
25:48
justice for all
25:52
it is also a place for righteousness and
25:55
holiness
26:00
that your amazing forefathers heard my
26:03
voice and made plans for it
26:08
the enemy has always been afraid of
26:11
america
26:18
don't be afraid
26:23
even if you come home you'll be with me
26:28
there is no fear not even in death
26:32
you just step from life to life
26:40
if your family live here they're the
26:43
most blessed
26:44
people in existence
26:52
plans to be great
26:56
because it is time
27:02
for i will pour out my spirit on all
27:04
flesh
27:09
children will begin to pastor at age
27:12
[Applause]
27:18
five
27:20
children are the easiest to reach
27:22
because they don't question
27:24
and they don't reason and they don't let
27:26
their mind
27:27
get involved that's why i said you must
27:31
be like a little child
27:35
to enter into the kingdom
27:43
you have not because you asked not
27:47
but those who've asked already will
27:49
surely get what they have asked for
27:56
it is a new time on the earth
28:01
a miracle will be an example
28:04
but many countries will run to the light
28:07
and to my son
28:13
for there is a habitation coming
28:18
that will not end until i say it will
28:23
[Applause]
28:28
end
28:34
rejoice that i have shown these things
28:36
and spoken to you of these things
28:41
for those are my plans
28:50
the more you believe it is real
28:53
the more real it will become
29:10
there's coming a day very soon that when
29:13
you come here
29:17
the glory will be waiting
29:26
[Music]
29:32
portals are being opened everywhere
29:38
for heaven to pour in
29:41
but also for blessings to pour in
29:55
those who say i cannot speak through the
29:58
voice of a man
30:00
or mankind don't know me
30:10
make sure you laugh
30:14
laughter is the language of heaven
30:19
but profanity is the language of hell
30:24
don't let those words be in your mouth
30:27
in your home
30:31
allowed to enter into your home
30:34
guard your soul and the souls of your
30:37
children
30:39
by not letting anything pass
30:43
through any form of media
30:48
it will be a trap of the enemy
30:51
of what you've given permission to come
30:54
will come
31:11
if you say good morning to me every
31:13
morning
31:15
you'll be saying it before my throne
31:21
you command the day by what you choose
31:24
when you first wake
31:32
choose life and love
31:36
my power my presence
31:40
extreme discernment
31:48
and get understanding
31:53
these days will come quickly
31:57
and your life will change day by day
32:05
so all who hear this message
32:09
if you are my son or my daughter
32:12
if you have received my son and repented
32:15
of your sins
32:16
these words are for you
32:25
do not walk around
32:28
with your head held down but lift it
32:32
up
32:36
where your help comes from
32:40
even if people laugh they will not
32:44
be laughing for long
32:50
pray for those who have chosen the
32:52
darkness
32:53
and are expecting it to win some will
32:56
take their life
32:57
when they lose
33:00
because their souls have been
33:02
compromised
33:04
by the lies they've been listening to
33:08
guard well the layers of your soul what
33:11
you put there
33:18
and always choose life
33:23
i love you says your god amen
33:41
yes
33:43
[Music]
33:48
[Applause]
33:50
yes
33:52
[Music]
33:54
[Applause]
33:57
[Music]
34:18
oh
34:32
it is hard to stand
34:36
i won't fall
34:41
i'm sure my angels are behind me
34:49
i don't want a stool
34:56
what is that
35:02
no
35:08
no but we could just lay hands on
35:11
everybody and end it
35:16
[Music]
35:20
it's pretty pretty hard to top god
35:31
and for those of you who don't think
35:33
this is real may he come to you
35:46
when i walked in the angel of the lord
35:49
who looks just like jesus
35:51
came in behind me to make sure i
35:54
wouldn't fall down before i got up here
35:59
and god's been speaking to me like the
36:02
last several hours before i got here
36:05
and some people think why is she late
36:06
why is she late well are you going to
36:08
turn around and say no
36:10
to god
36:18
i was right on time
36:26
[Applause]
36:32
god was very wise calling me a revelator
36:36
instead of a prophet because he knew all
36:39
the bashers
36:41
wouldn't know what a false revelator was
36:56
he was very detailed with me before i
36:58
started traveling and speaking
37:01
and he'd already warned me about a lot
37:03
of stuff that would happen or would be
37:05
said which
37:06
i understand people don't understand
37:10
what they don't know or they have not
37:12
experienced their self
37:14
it is hard for them to receive it
37:19
seeing is not believing
37:23
receiving is believing
37:33
god has given me many titles i didn't
37:35
ask for any of them
37:38
and many people say i want to be you i
37:40
go no you don't
37:45
you don't really and i've heard people
37:47
say he chose seven men before he chose
37:49
you no he didn't
37:52
he did choose me he knew me when i was
37:56
in him he knew every one of you
37:59
already knew what you would become and
38:02
on your soul that he created he wrote if
38:04
he would be male or female
38:07
no matter how man says how that happens
38:12
and your soul will be conflicted if
38:13
you're told you're something else
38:19
because your soul already knew what it
38:20
was supposed to be
38:25
but if the ones who wanted to take over
38:27
have their way
38:28
they would let anybody choose whatever
38:30
they want to
38:34
but god has a plan
38:38
you were with him before you came to
38:39
this earth before this world was made
38:42
before he stretched out the universe the
38:44
physical realm
38:45
over the spiritual realm that's why when
38:48
it says in revelations he will roll it
38:50
up
38:51
he knows where the ends are
38:55
he had to put something out there that
38:58
he could put physical things on
39:00
because all he had the original realm is
39:03
the spiritual realm
39:05
the unseen realm unless he lets you see
39:08
it
39:09
from the time i was little i was a seer
39:12
i saw the good guys and the bad guys
39:16
i saw activities of the spirit realm you
39:19
hear people talk about angels and demons
39:20
there's much more than that
39:22
all around you there's buildings built
39:24
that both sides
39:25
use depending on what is going around in
39:28
that area
39:30
there's platforms built by these spirits
39:33
of wickedness in high places how do they
39:34
get in high places
39:36
they earn it by hunting for souls for
39:38
the enemy
39:40
these are wicked spiritual beings
39:42
however
39:45
when you learn to command an army that
39:47
was created to pull down
39:49
every stronghold of satan they're
39:53
the ones who war against hell
39:56
no matter what level of wickedness they
39:58
operate in
39:59
they can shred those platforms built by
40:02
these spirits of wickedness in high
40:03
places
40:05
and they go through light buzz saws and
40:08
they can't stop it from happening
40:11
because we who have the flesh
40:15
you're the ones who have authority in
40:16
the earth
40:18
every spirit would be coming from hell
40:20
trying to take over
40:21
they use people like they apparently are
40:23
right now
40:24
but they cannot do it they can't
40:28
the earth is made for men and those who
40:31
receive jesus christ
40:33
you're called to rule in the spirit
40:35
realm
40:36
when you take authority and dominion in
40:38
the spirit realm it then impacts and
40:41
packs
40:41
this physical realm
40:45
and because we haven't known how to do
40:47
it to his fullness
40:48
satan has just taken all he wants to
40:52
done what he wanted to kill who he wants
40:55
to
40:56
put fear in who he wants to we're not
40:59
tolerating it anymore
41:05
jesus clearly said the things i did you
41:07
will do and greater
41:09
things you will do than i did
41:13
so you should be trying to stop the
41:15
storms
41:18
we can help you do that
41:21
you can either email or call our office
41:24
and ask for
41:25
weather warrior information that's god's
41:27
name
41:29
that he gave for this group who's
41:31
willing to step
41:32
out and just do what his son did
41:36
i didn't pick that name we are to take
41:38
authority over
41:39
any form of destructive weather
41:44
and whether you know it or not in the
41:45
word of god when he made the ocean
41:48
and he made the land he told the ocean i
41:51
set a boundary
41:52
right here at the land and you will
41:56
not pass over
42:01
that's god's word that's his decree we
42:04
are his sons and daughters it is
42:06
our job to uphold that
42:10
and tell those storms you will not cross
42:13
over on the land or do destruction
42:15
he created the weather to nourish the
42:18
earth
42:20
not to damage it
42:24
so we sit down here and say god come and
42:26
rescue us
42:28
come and stop this and he's looking down
42:31
saying i gave you authority
42:34
you have authority you
42:37
rule because the enemy knows he can get
42:39
in and twist any of those weather system
42:41
and use them the best he can because he
42:44
comes to what
42:46
kill steal destroy
42:49
and one of the ways he does that is with
42:51
the weather
42:54
so volcanoes are not supposed to be
42:56
erupting
42:57
tsunamis are not supposed to be
42:59
destroying
43:01
none of that stuff that's going on but
43:04
there's been no voice
43:06
or agreement in the body that they would
43:09
no longer tolerate that
43:13
he taught the disciples how to multiply
43:17
food how to travel in the spirit realm
43:21
how to take authority and dominion over
43:24
all the power of the darkness cast out
43:26
any and all demons
43:28
to pray for the sick to be healed why
43:31
are we tolerating
43:33
the virus
43:37
because i'm not it has no right here
43:46
the body needs to wake up stand up
43:50
and step out you can wake up all you
43:53
want to
43:55
he wants you to do all of those things
43:59
and i can tell you right now the
44:01
meteorologists don't know what's
44:02
happening
44:04
they're going wild we even have some of
44:07
their briefings where they talked about
44:09
what is wrong with this weather they're
44:12
almost afraid to give a forecast of
44:14
anything
44:16
because it never happens and then they
44:19
faked it
44:22
they faked it to prove these things were
44:24
happening those weren't even the storm
44:25
that was going on
44:29
those in the area that the storms are
44:31
headed to have the greatest authority if
44:33
you're a believer
44:37
so those on the east coast
44:40
we have melt we have built a wall
44:43
and if you go back and look at every
44:45
storm that's come after
44:47
dorian when we told it we all started
44:50
saying you will not and cannot cross
44:51
over
44:52
the boundaries god set for you and all
44:54
the way down not just in florida where
44:56
we started it
44:57
all the way up the east coast believers
44:58
are standing saying you will not cross
45:00
over and do destruction
45:02
and every time a storm comes you can go
45:04
look at it
45:05
it comes a certain way then it hits the
45:06
wall and goes back out
45:11
and they don't understand it's simply
45:15
the body of christ
45:16
taking authority
45:19
so when we learn oh hawaii has got it
45:22
down
45:25
we have a lot of friends there's a lot
45:26
of weather warriors that live in hawaii
45:28
it doesn't even get started before they
45:29
get out there and they start
45:33
i'll never forget the time that this
45:35
massive like i think was category 5 was
45:38
coming
45:38
and i had been teaching and talking to
45:40
him about taking authority
45:42
and we all declared that this storm will
45:44
not be allowed to come ashore
45:46
and the head of it would be taken off
45:50
and when everyone went to bed except me
45:53
because they don't sleep at night
45:56
when they all went to bed when they woke
45:57
up there was nothing but shreds left
46:01
and they couldn't understand or get it
46:03
because they knew for sure that the the
46:04
island would be consumed
46:07
and those people those whether foreign
46:09
would not let up that prayer of
46:11
agreement we had
46:12
they said we don't know how it happened
46:14
but it looks like the head was taken
46:16
these are the meteorologists saying this
46:19
the head was taken right off
46:21
[Music]
46:23
it was a nothing and one reporter said
46:27
never in 25 years of being a
46:28
meteorologist
46:30
i ever see i never saw that happen
46:33
i'm still trying to go back over all the
46:35
tapes all the information that we've
46:37
accumulated to know exactly what could
46:39
should have happened
46:40
and it didn't happen
46:43
why because they're not tolerating it
46:47
so whoever lives in the gulf better stop
46:50
stepping up
46:53
is not coming to florida
46:57
i live there and i'm not putting up with
47:01
it anymore
47:05
[Applause]
47:08
you need to just get fed up
47:18
what yes
47:22
whoever has the fires
47:28
in your state you better start saying
47:30
you're not tolerating it anymore
47:35
you come into low pressure system to
47:38
form
47:39
and come in and put the fires out
47:44
[Applause]
47:46
that is not something new in the bible
47:49
they called forth
47:50
rain to come and they begin to see the
47:53
clouds form
47:55
did it come and did
47:58
it rain why are we any different than
48:02
them
48:04
it's called believing your faith
48:08
and guess what in heaven you'll need
48:09
your faith
48:11
not to pay your rent not to be healed
48:15
not for any of those things but to begin
48:18
to create
48:21
who is our father
48:27
do you know in the bible when it says
48:29
let us make men in our image that's what
48:31
they look like
48:33
like with the glory on them the light of
48:35
god on them
48:36
but after our likeness is how they
48:39
operate
48:42
we're supposed to operate like them we
48:44
are not god
48:46
you don't want to be god i don't want to
48:49
be god
48:50
i've seen alone but i still don't want
48:52
to be god no one's that many kids
49:02
the devil actually isn't god's problem
49:07
it's how we all operate and stand
49:10
against them
49:13
he should be running does it say he will
49:15
run from us
49:19
do you remember that scripture
49:22
you submit yourself under the hand of
49:24
god and resist the enemy
49:29
what will he do he will flee
49:33
from you he's talking to you
49:36
you do you know the word resist doesn't
49:39
go
49:39
oh no no i don't know what this is
49:42
i will not tolerate you you're a liar
49:46
and a
49:47
friar and i serve the most high god
49:50
only him
49:57
and he'll run
50:01
there are people the demons beg not to
50:04
be assigned to
50:07
because when they come back and they're
50:09
not successful with their assignment
50:10
they get punished
50:13
the devil doesn't give anybody rewards
50:15
not even his own he just punishes them
50:17
when they don't listen
50:19
so they don't want to they'll lie
50:21
they'll do anything they can
50:23
they don't want to and by the way when
50:24
you learn to release the anointing they
50:26
burn and it hurts they'll burn
50:29
if they get near the fire of god it will
50:31
burn them like it's going to melt them
50:34
they may live in hell's fire they don't
50:37
want god's fire
50:40
why baptism and fire is coming
50:43
[Music]
50:43
[Applause]
50:48
see i was raised on the word of god
50:52
god chose when my birth would happen on
50:55
this earth
50:56
he chose my father's my mother's by the
50:58
way my mother is here tonight
51:04
she'll be 90 next april
51:08
she had 15 children
51:12
i am number three and my sister's number
51:14
15 right there
51:18
and any of them could testify to
51:20
anything i'm saying
51:23
i never was normal
51:29
i didn't want to speak to people even
51:31
though i didn't want to speak to people
51:32
i didn't want to hug them
51:36
i just wanted god jesus holy spirit you
51:37
know my little nice
51:39
apartment somewhere and do big business
51:43
he took me out of my world of business
51:46
yeah it's like he didn't know we need to
51:48
pay checks
51:51
seriously he did this he always told me
51:53
before he would do something with me
51:56
my grandmother was my dad's mother was a
51:58
powerful woman of god
52:00
she was in the jungles of panama and was
52:02
afraid of nothing
52:04
ever she'd come to her home on
52:08
sabbatical i mean we had more kids than
52:09
anybody she could have come any
52:10
anywhere i don't remember she had eight
52:12
or nine
52:13
of her own our aunts and uncles
52:16
so she had a lot of children but she
52:19
always came
52:20
to our house because god was there we
52:23
knew she could see through the walls
52:26
we knew she could see right inside of us
52:29
and every time she came she'd lay her
52:31
hand on her head you will
52:33
serve and know the most high god
52:36
and my brother would run and hide
52:40
i'm not going to be a missionary and be
52:41
eaten by the alligators or crocodiles
52:45
no right now they lock him on death row
52:47
to minister to death apprentice
52:48
prisoners
52:50
he's invited by hell's angels to come
52:52
and do funerals
52:55
i don't think he's afraid of crocodiles
52:58
anymore
53:01
my mom would tell me every day you are
53:03
so strange i don't know what god's going
53:05
to do with you
53:08
i was little i ate once a day i slept
53:11
four hours a day
53:13
my whole life i would know things
53:16
my siblings didn't care too much for
53:18
that
53:24
my dad was a great mentor that his own
53:28
mother in the jungles of panama on her
53:30
own
53:30
they had a murderer loose in the village
53:32
i know some of you heard the story
53:34
before but it just shows you
53:35
who she was she was on the mission field
53:38
in the little hut somewhere where she
53:39
was ministering and she i think she
53:41
lived there for i forgot how many years
53:42
many years
53:44
and everybody was boarding up their
53:45
windows to keep this murder from out she
53:47
left her window open
53:50
and she went to sleep right in front of
53:53
the window
53:56
because guess what she knew god sure
53:59
enough
54:00
late at night here comes a foot in the
54:01
window
54:03
and this huge machete coming with him
54:06
and she turn around look at him and she
54:07
goes freeze in jesus name
54:11
and rolled over and went back to sleep
54:14
and three hours later when the police
54:17
arrived
54:18
he was still frozen
54:26
that was my grandmother
54:35
i was taught to never be afraid
54:40
i knew there was a god i knew there was
54:42
his son
54:43
i knew there was holy spirit who is my
54:45
best friend
54:47
that means he'll tweak you 24 hours a
54:50
day that's what that means
54:53
let me speak to you 24 hours a day but
54:55
lots of times he's tweaking you
55:01
he wouldn't warn me something's going to
55:02
happen i don't think i'd do that that's
55:04
what he says to me
55:06
i don't think i'd go there so i'm not
55:08
going to go there okay
55:09
i don't ask him why
55:13
but you have to have your ears open to
55:15
listen
55:16
and it's really good idea if you say i
55:19
choose holy spirit to give you
55:20
permission to get my attention when i'm
55:22
not paying attention
55:24
it is one of the most powerful things
55:25
you can say
55:27
anybody here let's just say it together
55:29
holy spirit
55:31
from this moment on i give you
55:34
permission
55:37
to get my attention when i'm not paying
55:40
attention
55:42
so be it there you did it
55:50
i did that when i was really young it
55:52
saved me a lot
55:53
let me tell you if i gave the mic to jen
55:57
she'd come up here now she would preach
55:58
all the time
55:59
she knows that's true because he does
56:01
the same thing with her
56:04
every morning
56:08
it's called living a new life
56:12
heaven culture isn't just a thing it's a
56:15
lifestyle
56:18
so if you want to live on earth as they
56:20
live in heaven you need to learn to live
56:22
heaven culture
56:24
what is that how they live in heaven
56:28
and living the same way on the earth
56:30
they're free of fear free of lack
56:32
free of grief free of anything of the
56:35
enemy
56:36
never sick they go well they're in
56:38
heaven yes
56:39
they are but our father who is in heaven
56:44
holy is your name your kingdom come by
56:47
the way
56:48
that is heaven your kingdom
56:52
is heaven you're speaking to the
56:55
father right your kingdom come
56:59
your will be done on earth as it is in
57:01
heaven that is heaven culture
57:03
you are literally praying a prayer that
57:05
asks for heaven culture
57:09
and he's released it on the earth you
57:12
choose it
57:15
you lose everything under your soul
57:16
that's not him every trauma from the
57:18
past every wicked evil
57:21
disgusting vile movie you've ever
57:23
watched with your eyes it's in your soul
57:26
it's why he says to guard it for out of
57:29
it will flow the way you live your life
57:32
as a man think it's in his heart which
57:34
is your soul
57:36
not talking about your human beating
57:37
heart the heart also means the
57:40
core or the center of something that's
57:41
your soul that's what you are
57:43
you are a living soul and what you fill
57:47
it with
57:47
is what you will become that's why
57:50
people you've known all your life kind
57:52
nice people i know some of them who now
57:54
hate with a hate i've never seen before
57:56
in people
57:57
they hate and despise don't even know
57:59
why why they listen to the fake news
58:02
and for years they have filled their
58:04
layers you have layers
58:06
whatever you feel the most of is what
58:07
you're going to begin to act like
58:12
so if you don't like you change what
58:14
you're watching
58:16
even what you say goes in your own soul
58:18
so if you don't like you
58:19
you've been telling yourself that for
58:20
years and you put another layer of it in
58:23
you
58:24
and what's in there is what you will
58:25
think about and if you think about it
58:26
you're going to choose it if you choose
58:28
it you're going to do it again that's
58:29
called
58:29
what criminals do
58:32
this is true that's why a criminal will
58:34
get out of prison
58:36
go commit a crime and go back right back
58:37
to prison if they've been there 20 years
58:39
it'll you know why it's in their soul
58:42
and i've been to prison to talk
58:46
it's good to hear that and i had 80
58:49
prisoners
58:50
and they had somebody guards trying to
58:53
watch
58:53
they never watched they listened to
58:56
protect me my husband was with me
58:58
sitting up here staring at every one of
59:02
them
59:05
but then even he was crying and i told
59:08
them how they were sought out by the
59:09
enemy even as a little child
59:11
they had a great call on their life so
59:13
he didn't want them to be loosed on the
59:15
earth
59:16
they might find out who they are and do
59:18
destruction to his plans
59:20
so he gets them into crime this is truth
59:22
he gets him into crime when you do it it
59:24
was in your soul
59:26
then he makes sure they get caught
59:30
and then they get put in prison where
59:31
they can't be a threat to him
59:34
so every time they get up because it's
59:36
in them guess what they do it doesn't
59:37
matter how much therapy they give them
59:39
how many classes they take them to if
59:41
they can't get it out of them
59:44
they'll think about it they'll do it and
59:47
then they're back in the same place
59:49
so i told them the story of their life
59:51
this is what you're doing this is why
59:52
you're doing it
59:53
this is what god had for you this is
59:55
what satan is doing to you
59:56
and will proceed to do it to every
59:58
member of your family if you can then
60:00
they begin to cry then they get furious
60:03
you get mad at the devil then they get
60:06
born again filled with the holy spirit
60:07
then it teaches them how to war
60:10
i teach them how to send heaven's army
60:13
so now
60:14
insider prisons are very dangerous
60:16
people
60:17
who are dangerous against hell
60:24
i mean anybody could go to prison right
60:26
but why are these people in rhythm
60:28
they are dangerous because of their
60:31
destiny
60:32
and satan doesn't want them loose
60:38
your soul is very important to you don't
60:42
ever forget that
60:44
you choose with your soul all day long
60:48
you choose christ right after that you
60:51
should choose what he chooses
60:52
all day long you should guide what you
60:56
choose what you watch what you say
60:59
i love that little saying these half
61:01
years what would jesus do
61:03
what would he say what would he choose
61:08
it's actually a very free life
61:11
to not sin people get shocked when they
61:15
say i don't sin
61:17
oh that's impossible no it's not
61:21
you choose not to
61:25
you just say no
61:28
say no to who was ever asking you sorry
61:30
my soul is too important
61:32
i'm not corrupting my soul they'd really
61:35
think you were weird who cares because
61:38
when they start to die they'll call you
61:39
to pray for them
61:41
they'll look for you if it's on their
61:43
deathbed hey you know about heaven
61:45
i need to go there they'll forget they
61:49
made fun of you
61:52
that's why it's important that you not
61:55
suffer
61:55
trauma for 30 years after it happened
61:59
you know who's doing that the devil
62:02
because you saw it or experienced it and
62:04
he will replay it and replay it
62:06
stop the video stop it stop it stop it
62:11
and lose it from your soul jesus and
62:13
after your will because of jesus to lose
62:15
it from your soul he'll come down and
62:17
pull it out
62:17
and it will literally be like it never
62:19
happened to you
62:20
[Music]
62:21
i've seen too many people set free and
62:24
they went from being
62:26
you know in the dredges of despair
62:28
suicidal
62:29
they'd have these dreams every night
62:31
about the torment or whatever it was the
62:32
trauma they went through
62:34
and three minutes with me
62:37
and the revelation god gave me while
62:39
their husband their pastor went in the
62:40
store to get me some things to eat
62:42
i was invited to speak his wife was set
62:44
free she was a different person when he
62:46
came out
62:49
and then she brought her 17 year old and
62:51
her 11 year old sons to me
62:53
because they were present when she was
62:54
abused so much they lose
62:56
out of all their soul and they haven't
62:57
never six years later i've never had
62:59
another
63:00
nightmare or torment
63:06
you can be free the truth makes you free
63:09
and the truth is you can be free
63:15
even from heroin from witchcraft
63:20
homosexuality doesn't matter what it is
63:23
from the enemy
63:25
you choose with your will to be free and
63:27
yes we pray for people to be free
63:28
from homosexuality which is a spirit
63:32
and guess what they have powerful
63:34
destinies every one of them
63:36
the devil targets the ones
63:40
who have the greatest destinies to bring
63:43
freedom or liberty to people
63:45
and he wants to keep them from doing
63:47
that so he gets them distracted
63:49
sidetracked on the wrong path filled
63:52
with lies believing that's how god made
63:54
them but remember when he made them he
63:56
wrote on their soul
63:58
this is who you are this is what you
64:00
will be
64:02
and he had plans for them from that
64:03
moment i will tell you this there is a
64:05
move coming to them and millions of them
64:06
will get born again
64:13
[Music]
64:14
not not not just a few millions
64:17
he'll move on them they'll know who they
64:19
were he'll know the entire time it was a
64:21
lie
64:24
and they will repent from it reject it
64:26
completely and run
64:28
into god's kingdom
64:31
and they'll be great witnesses i will
64:34
also tell you this
64:35
millions of muslims are about to expect
64:38
they will experience salvation
64:48
god is still into saving people
64:52
number one thing make sure you belong to
64:54
him
64:57
if you get saved at least you're going
64:58
to have it
65:01
a lot of people have it happen on their
65:03
deathbed
65:04
and the family member said i never saw
65:06
it happen so you think it didn't happen
65:09
did you believe they would be because
65:12
the number one thing besides getting
65:13
jesus you better believing that your
65:15
family members will know jesus christ
65:17
give their life to him and be with you
65:19
in heaven
65:21
there's a reason why you should do that
65:23
you have the greatest influence in the
65:25
spirit realm
65:26
over their life as family members
65:31
and jesus the first time he took me to
65:33
heaven said there'd be so many in the
65:34
earth to be shocked when they get there
65:35
to see who's up there
65:38
and yet they were the very one who
65:40
prayed and believed for their salvation
65:45
we have so many promises as a believer
65:51
we as the body of crisis will see an
65:54
example
65:55
a living walking breathing
65:59
taking authority dominion releasing life
66:02
to people
66:03
and let them see you happy and
66:06
joyful while you're doing it
66:10
maybe they might want jesus
66:14
one of the biggest things i know it will
66:15
happen eventually the world will know
66:17
us the body of christ by our what our
66:20
love for each other
66:23
stop fighting the plan of the enemy
66:28
dividing conqueror is his plan
66:32
and in this whole last year several
66:35
years before the
66:36
virus it's not
66:39
a plague and it is not a disease
66:45
even in the natural viruses come
66:48
and they go
66:51
but people act like they are
66:54
i'm not saying you can't protect
66:56
yourself if you want to
66:58
i'm not tolerating sickness or disease
67:02
i'm not tolerating it every time you
67:04
bless your food i hope you're blessing
67:06
your food
67:07
i won't ask for a show of hands
67:12
my daddy let us eat after we blessed our
67:15
food
67:16
and then he added things the prayer went
67:18
on forever
67:22
i know where he got it from because when
67:23
his mom came off the mission field she
67:25
would have a 40 minute prayer at the
67:26
dinner
67:30
and she knew without open her eyes if
67:31
you were going to leave the table
67:34
and then she'd pray for you
67:38
blessing your food is a very powerful
67:40
thing because it says when you do that
67:43
and you ask he will take sickness far
67:47
from you so if you haven't been doing it
67:51
do it that means he won't allow it to
67:55
come to you
67:56
or your home that's what you've got an
67:57
interpretation you won't allow it to
67:59
come to you or your home
68:01
if you are declaring that when i say my
68:03
blessing is not 30 minutes long but you
68:05
know i added a few things
68:08
i will hold my plate up in the
68:09
restaurant or anywhere else look at
68:10
father doesn't it smell good
68:14
and i'm gonna enjoy every bite of it
68:17
so bless it to my body and may the isis
68:21
have a never-ending crisis may hell
68:24
have triple trouble in hell as long as
68:28
i'm alive
68:30
i thank you for blessing all those who
68:31
serve you who know you who love you
68:36
amen so if we go out together
68:39
after i'm invited and that pastor says
68:42
will you bless the food
68:44
who's ever with me will go okay
68:49
and what are they gonna do here i'm
68:51
picking up my plate are they going to
68:52
sit there and just stare at theirs
68:54
lift it up everybody
68:57
[Applause]
68:58
i'm training you to blush your food
69:04
that you actually can have food and
69:06
actually can eat the food
69:09
amen many countries can't do that
69:12
but we can remember that the next time
69:16
somebody asks you to say blessing
69:19
i challenge you to do it do you know why
69:22
because it was a day when i was in my
69:26
late teens and i was saying my rope
69:28
prayer
69:28
father thank you for the soon blessings
69:30
in my body and my swelling was named my
69:31
person thank you wayman
69:33
did you even hear those words and i
69:36
literally heard from heaven this is
69:37
before he started taking me
69:38
i heard like a rubber stamp wham
69:42
500 billion 260 million
69:46
eight hundred and ten and 0001
69:49
can you say something else
69:54
that we might actually be excited to
69:56
hear he really said that to me
69:59
so from that day i have never
70:03
blessed my food like that
70:08
it's a habit that's not a blessing
70:12
that's not a blessing it's a habit right
70:18
you need to get god excited
70:22
father i thank you for this amazing food
70:24
smells good looks good
70:25
i can't wait to see what you're going to
70:27
do with me next i am so ready
70:31
who cares what people hear
70:34
at least they'll know there's someone
70:35
around that knows god
70:39
my little sister gave her famous
70:42
blessing i think she was four or five
70:44
and we were all huh not jen
70:48
one of our other sisters i have eight
70:51
sisters and seven brothers
70:54
and an alligator named charlie but he's
70:55
in heaven he doesn't have to live in a
70:57
bathtub
70:58
up but i've seen him in heaven your pets
71:00
i'll go to heaven
71:04
be nice to them they'll remember you
71:14
and they'll talk
71:18
[Applause]
71:19
[Music]
71:22
and i already hear some people's heads
71:24
it's too late to tell me that's not true
71:27
you haven't been there because if you
71:29
did you would know that
71:31
why not did you know
71:35
that many animals actually have a spirit
71:37
in the soul
71:40
go back to genesis and read when
71:43
noah back in the day when my meetings
71:48
would be six hours long i'd do three or
71:49
four i was just like
71:51
like this and i would call let's see i
71:53
called them i have called noah moses
71:56
and adam and then one time i called him
71:58
noses
72:01
because my head was so tired i couldn't
72:04
remember
72:05
and every time i knew that everybody
72:07
emailed me i don't think you know who
72:09
actually put people on the ark
72:11
and then we get phone calls and they go
72:13
yeah she knows she blew it
72:14
okay she knows this is moa and noses and
72:17
noah because you know she couldn't
72:18
really remember
72:21
if you go back and read that you know
72:22
what i'm telling this is what the father
72:24
told me
72:25
this is how he taught me like a little
72:26
kid because when i go to heaven i'm like
72:28
eight years old with pigtails
72:31
and he actually talks to all of you like
72:33
children
72:35
man is the one who likes to expound
72:39
and make things totally not even
72:42
understandable
72:43
or approachable
72:47
but god doesn't talk to us like that so
72:49
he talked me said i'm going to teach you
72:51
something
72:52
and why because i've seen pets in heaven
72:54
and i'm like wow there's
72:55
every one of my pets they were in this
72:57
long line and they were on my father's
72:59
ranch in heaven
73:00
and they started with sally the pig and
73:03
i got i got corrected because i said
73:04
there was
73:05
pork in heaven i didn't say he ate the
73:07
pig
73:10
he was a family pet gave them to my
73:11
father when he retired from the ministry
73:13
it was this big when it died it was 1100
73:16
pounds
73:18
i saw her in heaven and her were two
73:20
little mice that we had in new york city
73:22
when you were allowed to have pets
73:23
they lived in the wall they were
73:24
residents so we just kept them
73:29
i recognized my brother joey's duck name
73:33
max that he had when he was nine charlie
73:36
the alligator that i've always talked
73:37
about we all had in florida we live in
73:39
florida
73:40
and he lived in our bathtub and we had
73:42
to take it out and clean the tub and
73:43
he'd wander around the bathroom
73:48
every goat bird fish
73:52
snake lots of them spiders and iguana
73:55
named iggy
73:56
i saw every single one of them in heaven
74:00
every one of them a long line as long as
74:02
you see following my dad
74:04
walking around on my dad's ranch
74:07
and the father took me to the stone he
74:08
said i need to explain this to you
74:10
because people will argue
74:11
and they're not god
74:14
so they think they know better than me
74:17
but if you go read
74:18
the scripture in genesis where i told
74:22
noah to put the animals on the
74:26
ark and then he took me further
74:29
you know even closer further away at the
74:32
beginning
74:33
of time when he made adam
74:37
and it talks about how you know god the
74:39
father and jesus were both there by the
74:41
way
74:41
the father said adam jesus stepped out
74:44
of him that's what the word always did
74:45
he stepped out and made his body
74:47
but there was no life in him until he
74:49
did one thing
74:51
the father leans over because the father
74:53
carries
74:54
life he leaned over and breathed
74:57
adam's spirit of life that was his
75:00
spirit man
75:03
he breathed adam's spiritual body into
75:06
his nostrils and he became
75:07
a living soul and i went oh yeah i've
75:10
always known that
75:12
he said but you didn't never connect it
75:14
to noah go back and read this scripture
75:16
in genesis
75:17
and i did and do you know what it says
75:20
that god told noah to put every animal
75:22
on the earth
75:23
that had a spirit of life in it
75:28
you don't have to believe me believe the
75:30
word that meant
75:32
those creatures had souls and a spirit
75:35
body
75:37
oh that's from god i can't take credit
75:40
that's how revelation happens
75:42
it changes the way you think so people
75:44
will argue with you it's too late it's
75:45
in the word
75:48
so i don't think mosquitoes have a soul
75:49
i think they just they go die and go to
75:51
hell with the flies
75:54
[Applause]
76:02
they came from hell they can't have a
76:04
soul right
76:07
but i did learn that all your pets go to
76:09
heaven
76:11
and then when one would die i'd actually
76:12
see my angel take his spiritual body and
76:15
take it to heaven
76:16
your own guardian angel takes your pet's
76:18
spiritual body and takes it to heaven
76:20
and they live in your mansion
76:23
they will be eating at the table when
76:24
you get there
76:27
they will not be eating off the floor
76:29
anymore so
76:33
people go it doesn't say the word
76:35
animals are in heaven it says creatures
76:39
preach the gospel to who
76:43
what to what i preached the gospel to
76:46
every pe
76:46
i had i was gonna make sure they made it
76:52
creatures remember around the throne the
76:55
living
76:58
they have bodies like animals but
77:01
they're not
77:03
they're highly intelligent have always
77:05
been with god
77:06
like melchizedek who had no father no
77:08
mother no beginning or ends
77:11
there was more than father son and holy
77:13
spirit i always say father word and holy
77:15
spirit
77:17
and so melchizedek has always been with
77:19
him he is father's personal high priest
77:21
thank you not one of adam's sons
77:24
he's not a human that died and went to
77:26
heaven
77:28
he's always been with him i've seen a
77:31
syllabus this big that tells you about
77:33
um what is it what is that one thing
77:35
they talk about well number one they
77:36
always talk about the stone god will
77:38
give you when you get to heaven
77:39
and you always see on the syllabus a
77:41
river rock with some big long name
77:44
because he will give you a nickname the
77:46
only he and you know
77:48
and that white rock is a white diamond
77:51
is not a river rock the word rock in
77:54
heaven means
77:56
gemstone because he's not cheap or poor
78:03
right when when you get married you give
78:06
your
78:07
the toes a ring with a diamond in it or
78:10
some beautiful stone right
78:12
he's old bran so get ready for your pets
78:16
to be in heaven
78:18
amen and they'll be with you for all
78:21
eternity so i keep telling people be
78:23
nice to them
78:24
they'll thank you for how often you let
78:26
them out
78:29
or fed them the food under the table you
78:31
weren't supposed to
78:32
why do you think they try to eat it off
78:34
of the table later when you're not there
78:37
you spoil them
78:42
so when he said heaven is beyond
78:44
anything you ever thought or imagined
78:47
it is unless
78:51
i like the word unless it be revealed by
78:53
his spirit
78:55
so the spirit of god is the one who
78:57
catches me up all the time
78:59
without warning me i fall in the
79:01
driveway i'll go to heaven
79:02
i'm in the grocery store reaching for
79:03
something he takes me to heaven my
79:05
family know because they'll come in to
79:06
talk to me and there's nothing in me
79:08
this
79:09
my spirit man's in heaven the holy
79:11
spirit climbs and keeps my body alive
79:14
my husband is so used to it of 43 years
79:17
he'll come in and say something to me i
79:18
don't hear him i'm in heaven i don't
79:20
look down and watch what people are
79:21
doing are you kidding i'm listening to
79:22
what god is showing me
79:24
but my husband will say these words oh
79:28
i'll come back later
79:33
he is he is scottish he's not moved by
79:36
anything
79:38
even as his wife's body is sitting there
79:40
not breathing
79:42
he is not concerned
79:46
see he picked the right person for me
79:52
i remember the first day he saw an angel
79:54
walking down our hallway
79:57
and he freaked out although i've talked
80:00
about them thousands of times he
80:02
actually saw one he's like
80:07
nothing would come out
80:12
i said oh did you see the angel
80:18
he never doubted he just never you don't
80:21
sit there and cry because he doesn't get
80:22
to go
80:23
he's happy i go and he's happy i speak
80:27
don't ask him if he wants the mic you'll
80:30
get a joke and it will be a scottish
80:32
silk that you'll never get the ending to
80:35
you'll never get the punchline
80:39
but if you ever want to fish and catch
80:42
big fish that is a gift god gave him
80:46
when he sent him from himself he made
80:48
him a fisherman
80:50
that's his passion that's his greatest
80:51
thing besides me and jesus
80:53
and guess what i hate yes
80:56
i hate fish let willy be free
81:01
i don't want him in my freezer in my
81:02
home in a frying pan
81:04
or on my table they're slimy they stink
81:08
they smell and i don't like i don't like
81:10
them
81:13
so if i went fishing he'd have to take
81:14
it off he'd still be here in jesus game
81:17
and i'm not touching that fish and do
81:20
you think god knew this
81:21
of course he knew it of course
81:24
he gave some of me somebody with five
81:26
layers in their soul
81:28
that's like a rock and you aren't ever
81:31
changing that man
81:33
i'm glad he knows jesus that's all i can
81:35
say
81:37
loves jesus hears very clearly gives me
81:40
words from god all the time little
81:41
scratches of paper
81:43
but doesn't talk about it so he gave me
81:46
somebody who doesn't care about talking
81:48
or want to talk thank god right because
81:50
we'd be wearing each other out
81:53
i pray for people spouses want to see
81:55
they both minister
81:56
and they're wanting the microphone
82:03
[Applause]
82:06
i have no competition
82:14
yeah well my sister kind of makes up for
82:16
her
82:18
the baby who said she'd never talk to
82:20
anybody but
82:21
but taught 15. how many kids you haven't
82:24
used to class
82:26
16 two-year-olds for about 15 years
82:29
now she's braver than me i don't want to
82:32
do that
82:35
i don't want to catch fish and i don't
82:37
want that either
82:39
but she's really good at so that's why
82:40
she's writing all the children's books
82:43
and they're amazing our artist is every
82:45
time he gets time he works on it
82:48
every child around the world will know
82:49
there is a heaven there is a god
82:52
and what life is like there and the last
82:54
place i was taken that was new was
82:56
called whimsical way
82:58
it's up in the celestial realm the sky
83:00
of heaven and any little child who wants
83:02
to in heaven
83:03
either climbs into a bubble gets on the
83:05
bubble train
83:08
and takes him up to this amazing place
83:10
parents don't have to go
83:12
and they have all these creatures little
83:14
creatures that are their friends
83:16
and one day they'll be part of our
83:17
amusement park we've made
83:20
so heaven has got lots of plans for kids
83:23
fun you're probably one of the first
83:24
congregations i told this to
83:27
it was amazing these little creatures
83:28
had names they were wearing clothes they
83:30
were friends to these other kids
83:33
and they would all go up there whenever
83:34
they want to
83:36
and play and play and play and have fun
83:39
create little things and then they come
83:41
back down
83:42
because you live with your parents or
83:43
your grandparents or whoever is the
83:44
closest
83:45
in relation to you when you get to
83:47
heaven no child is left alone
83:52
we should celebrate who we are that is
83:55
your destiny
83:58
and the new earth i get a lot of flack
84:01
from that get over it
84:04
you're not god he's going to make a
84:07
and say new say new means new
84:11
he's already remodeled this one several
84:13
times already
84:15
he has yeah and when you get to heaven
84:18
everybody gets to see when he made it
84:21
you all learn how he made the earth the
84:23
first time
84:25
how it got messed up in verse two think
84:28
about it verse one verse two
84:30
how did that happen so quick in the
84:33
beginning god created the heavens and
84:35
the earth that means it was done
84:37
say don imperfect then wine number two
84:41
is it a mess
84:44
why is the water on the land and the sky
84:47
why is it trapped underneath all that
84:49
stuff
84:50
why is the earth all split up why is it
84:53
in darkness
84:56
the first one he didn't need the son or
84:58
the moon yet he made him yet
85:01
no he lit it with his glory
85:05
we should study the book of jeremiah he
85:08
turned the light out at one time
85:10
satan was making the earth a wilderness
85:16
rick knocking nose but really when he
85:19
made it the first time it was perfect
85:22
and he lit it with his glory there was
85:25
no evil on the earth
85:28
at that time and then of course you all
85:31
know
85:31
satan lucifer was cast out of heaven
85:33
down to the earth
85:35
and he thought he was going to take over
85:36
he's tried so many times i don't know
85:37
why he didn't give up but the dinosaurs
85:40
became evil
85:41
because they got possessed and used and
85:44
i know people talk about
85:45
i don't know where they get these things
85:46
from reptilian seed because god made the
85:49
donors dinosaurs not satan
85:51
oh you don't even want to know about
85:52
their children you don't need to know
85:53
about okay it doesn't have anything to
85:54
do with us
85:56
man comes up with their own head
85:58
knowledge and understanding
86:00
of something and there are no nephilim
86:03
on the earth right now i assure you
86:06
there aren't any
86:10
so there's too much really to talk about
86:12
all that you've already got what you
86:13
really needed when
86:14
the first 15-20 minutes
86:18
you have revelation that a lot of people
86:20
don't know what's going to happen
86:22
you heard like uh i know 24-year plan
86:26
but really actually heard about a
86:27
50-year plan
86:29
i've been taking over 100 years into the
86:31
future and the earth was still here
86:34
and it was good
86:37
it was really good so each generation
86:41
until god's ready to stop
86:43
things it'll get stronger
86:46
they will manifest more they'll be in
86:48
charge more and
86:50
children will probably be the first ones
86:51
who command a mountain to jump into the
86:53
sea
86:54
and if they want to put it back they
86:55
will
86:57
because we go from where
87:01
this is not glory to glory glory to
87:03
glory
87:04
glory to glory this is us now glory to
87:07
the pit
87:08
glory to the pit glory to depression
87:11
glory to lack
87:12
glory to lack that isn't the way it goes
87:17
it goes from glory to glory to glory
87:21
that is an upward motion in authority in
87:24
dominion
87:25
in joy and celebration and the earth
87:27
being well
87:30
a hundred years from now it will be like
87:31
that so forget
87:34
stop trying to make plans to escape i
87:36
don't want to escape
87:38
i want to be here i'll be here the whole
87:40
time
87:42
and the people well jesus comes
87:43
tribulation comes all over no it's not
87:45
you don't know the bible
87:46
because jesus gets he will get his
87:49
thousand-year reign
87:51
and god's not keeping that from him why
87:53
would he
87:54
he's going to sit on that throne in
87:55
jerusalem and be king of the world
87:57
[Music]
87:59
for a thousand years and it's still not
88:00
over
88:02
because satan will be in a big pit oh
88:05
yeah
88:05
there will be no weapons on the earth
88:07
during that thousand years people will
88:09
live to be seven and 800 years old
88:12
because christ is sitting on the throne
88:15
and there'll still be people who aren't
88:16
saved
88:17
so that means people will make it
88:19
through the tribulation the whole earth
88:21
will not be destroyed in the tribulation
88:24
and everybody won't be killed off the
88:25
earth as there'd be no natural people
88:28
for jesus to rule over when he system
88:30
that's owned in jerusalem at the end of
88:32
the tribulation
88:33
right yeah who's he going to rule who's
88:35
he going to be in charge of
88:37
and there'll be kings and countries that
88:39
don't want him there can you believe
88:40
that they must have the must be
88:43
unintelligent i'll be polite it's not
88:46
what my flesh wanted to say
88:48
they will be as unintelligent as the
88:50
devil
88:52
they will not want him and they'll know
88:53
he's the son of god
88:55
he just wiped up all the all the wicked
88:58
evil armies right
89:01
he won like trump won
89:05
not that he's god but look at him he won
89:07
and he thought this is going to be easy
89:08
breezy
89:10
and never has every devil around come
89:13
after somebody
89:15
so harshly they hate him because he
89:18
stands for justice liberty and freedom
89:20
but they really hated him
89:24
when he became really dangerous and said
89:25
i'm fighting god back in your country
89:29
that was it
89:32
that was it the devil went crazy
89:36
he's not going to stay in that seat
89:39
i'll impeach him i'll declare him
89:43
incompetent
89:44
other people rise up all over you know
89:45
what they want a civil war here for a
89:47
long time
89:49
they want all of us to run the streets
89:50
and kill each other and i've told
89:52
them i talked to them sometimes do you
89:56
not understand a true american
89:58
they actually want life they want a
90:00
future
90:01
they have a family they don't want your
90:04
garbage
90:05
go to a third-world country and live if
90:08
you want socialism go where they have
90:09
dominism
90:11
we're not going to have it here why the
90:14
people don't want it
90:16
[Music]
90:19
you don't want it and they'll make it
90:21
sound like it's amazing
90:24
they'll make it sound like it's
90:25
beautiful go to venezuela
90:28
they're living in dumpsters if they can
90:30
find one
90:31
that's what happens i grew up
90:35
because of my natural age i've been
90:38
through many generations of time on the
90:40
earth
90:41
i remember the turmoil of the 60s when
90:44
people wanted to have nothing but love
90:45
and
90:46
or war then they didn't want to go to
90:48
war
90:49
they didn't want to do nothing
90:52
i remember that but i also remember
90:54
doing we would do these
90:56
what do you call them when you have to
90:57
do little
91:00
see my earth mine doesn't work so well
91:03
not projects this one you would hide
91:04
under your desk in case the russians
91:05
were coming to get you
91:08
anybody here have to do that
91:12
you were practicing if you were going to
91:15
be
91:16
bombed by the russians what's called the
91:19
cold war
91:20
it's pretty cold on that floor under my
91:22
desk
91:24
and when i was like eight nine ten they
91:26
all did it they'd stop
91:28
and they would let the alarm go
91:30
everybody would just
91:32
by habit oh drop what you're doing crawl
91:34
under your desk and hide
91:36
in case the bomb would hit
91:39
we lift like that until it was ended
91:45
okay so you don't want to live in russia
91:47
i've been there
91:49
the sadness is so horrific
91:53
i didn't i didn't get off the ship to go
91:55
unsure i could
91:56
feel it and see it like black clouds of
91:59
evil
92:01
and that i could feel with the people
92:02
with the great deep
92:04
sadness and grief that they had no
92:06
freedom
92:09
because if they take your weapons
92:12
the criminals aren't going to give up
92:13
theirs
92:16
you wonder where their heads are right
92:18
and who
92:19
in the world wants to do well i know
92:20
this is political well you have to give
92:22
it up because tomorrow that's what
92:23
you're really going to get
92:26
god is very politically minded
92:29
he doesn't want that he only wants that
92:33
who in the right mind which shows you
92:35
they probably don't have one anymore
92:37
wants to defund the police
92:41
i'd be amazed if anyone who lived in
92:43
california
92:45
or washington or oregon
92:48
or new york chicago i could just go down
92:52
this list
92:52
who in their mind having had no freedom
92:56
for
92:56
five months would vote in
93:00
the same governor or the senators or the
93:04
people
93:05
who didn't care if their places were
93:07
being destroyed
93:10
where does that come from
93:15
i promise you i won't tell you some of
93:16
the things the president is going to do
93:17
as soon as he gets
93:21
he'll reelected tweaking some governors
93:23
i'll just say that much and some mayors
93:27
and getting laws changed
93:28
[Music]
93:32
because people even the ones who voted
93:34
him and don't want
93:36
them now because they who won't allow
93:39
are having all the freedom they want to
93:41
do what they want to
93:43
and they're openly showing what's in
93:44
their soul that's the point of all this
93:47
god is exposing the souls the people
93:50
and they can hide and smile behind their
93:53
big office
93:54
but when it comes push to shove what's
93:57
in that soul is coming out
94:00
and people couldn't believe it when it
94:01
started happening what is wrong with
94:02
those people are they insane
94:04
because their people don't have liberty
94:06
freedom and there is no justice there is
94:08
no protection
94:10
there's no food there's no jobs people's
94:12
houses get broken into when they want to
94:14
do you know how many people i want to
94:15
tell you how many people have moved to
94:17
florida
94:20
we are being crushed with people every
94:23
day
94:23
because they were seeing us on the news
94:26
having liberty freedom and justice
94:30
enjoying our beaches
94:35
we were as good as we could be to work
94:36
along with the quarantine
94:39
but we had fresh air everywhere we went
94:40
you could open your door and have fresh
94:42
air
94:43
and people saw that and went i'm not
94:44
staying here no more so they're moving
94:46
out
94:47
and that should obviously you would
94:49
think would show the head
94:51
of that person who's in charge they
94:53
don't like this they're leaving
94:56
that means no votes that's right
94:59
now no one's going to want to vote them
95:00
back in you want to go through that
95:01
again
95:04
and no tax money you're right no tax
95:07
money to take care of anything
95:10
it's a mess
95:14
it's all free if they say give it up
95:17
give it all there give it all to us
95:18
we'll just take care of you don't
95:21
even think that's what's gonna happen
95:24
you gave away your destiny your future
95:26
your home your rights
95:28
your rights your rights your rights
95:31
that's what satan wants
95:34
but he's not going to get away with it
95:36
here say whoa to god
95:47
so people have a lot of questions they'd
95:49
like to ask me
95:50
and we'd be here for 10 more hours
95:54
and i wouldn't be sleeping
95:58
people always invite me then if they
95:59
ever ask me to visit their home
96:02
they try so hard to stay up while i'm up
96:05
and like falling asleep sitting next to
96:07
me
96:08
wanting to ask i don't do that anymore
96:09
by the way
96:11
i've actually spoken in um i remember
96:14
the name of that great black
96:15
university it's either maryland or
96:17
washington dc
96:19
i actually got to go speak there
96:24
yeah george washington university yeah i
96:26
did i was invited and they couldn't
96:28
squeeze the people they couldn't get
96:29
them they gave us a small room then
96:30
bigger room in a bigger room
96:31
because the students asked for it
96:34
and they have to say yes and they had so
96:37
many crammed in there you couldn't
96:38
hardly breathe
96:40
and the next night there was even more
96:43
and i was staying in the home of this
96:44
family
96:45
nobody could stay up they're like i
96:48
gotta go to sleep
96:50
and i'm still sitting here
96:54
you know in heaven you don't have to
96:56
sleep
96:58
people go i always wanted a bedroom done
97:00
a certain way well you'll get it
97:02
he'll make it for you to make you happy
97:05
it'll be your lounge
97:06
room your meditation room
97:11
you don't need to meditate when you're
97:12
living with the one that you meditate
97:14
about
97:19
your mansions are amazing some are under
97:22
the crystal sea
97:24
some are up in the skies of heaven they
97:27
have a rain forest in heaven
97:29
these 12 massive trees that could hold
97:31
some i've seen mansions the size of new
97:33
york city
97:34
one one mansion probably belonged to an
97:38
intercessor
97:41
seriously somebody you never knew or
97:42
heard of
97:45
you know they prayed in every move of
97:46
god until they were going on they're
97:47
probably still praying when they were
97:48
leaving
97:51
and i like to tell these young people
97:52
you may be living your life you want to
97:54
but if you have a grandma in heaven
97:56
she's going to pray the fire of god down
97:58
on you
98:00
because send the angels of heaven to
98:02
pursue you
98:04
and talk to the holy spirit non-stop
98:08
you may as well get up here roll over
98:10
and lay down and give up right now
98:12
because they're gonna get you
98:16
you'll listen to the prayers of your
98:17
grandma
98:19
i was in a where it was a fireman's sub
98:22
i'll talk anywhere
98:24
and somebody made a comment about my
98:25
hair which god picked not me
98:27
i did not pick this thing here i was not
98:29
a pink hair person oh no remember i was
98:31
the one that wanted to just hide
98:33
i want to be invisible i was okay with
98:35
being invisible he said you're not going
98:36
to be invisible you're not going to be
98:37
hiding anymore that's what he said to me
98:40
we need you to have pink highlights in
98:41
your hair
98:45
now i had probably about 40 pastor
98:47
friends in my city and then they thought
98:49
that was it i went over the edge
98:52
knowing me not changed but my pink hair
98:54
made it impossible to
98:56
to be friends with well what is wrong
99:00
with these people oh
99:01
they have no clue they're they're in the
99:03
flesh not the spirit
99:05
this is a spirit test if you don't like
99:08
it you're in the flesh
99:10
you like it you're walking in the spirit
99:17
so i don't ask for it but you can't hide
99:20
so everywhere i go and pastors go i
99:21
can't invite you
99:22
my congregation would freak out if they
99:24
saw your pink hair i said
99:26
you just didn't know how many hours they
99:27
watched of me on youtube and guess what
99:29
they come to my meetings at the church
99:30
next door to you
99:34
i don't think they're not the ones who
99:36
aren't ready
99:38
i think it's you
99:48
so because of this pink hair it opens up
99:51
me to speak about heaven everywhere
99:52
everywhere everywhere all day
99:54
all day no matter where it is it's even
99:58
happened here already
99:59
it doesn't matter people are attracted
100:01
to it while your hair is amazing yeah
100:02
the pastor should hear that right
100:04
get your evangelistic team to get color
100:06
colored highlights in their hair
100:08
and send them out into the streets and
100:10
see how many people they can draw
100:17
it's great marketing
100:20
and so they will say hey your hair's
100:22
cool yeah this is heaven culture
100:25
what does that mean that means i know
100:27
god he asked me to have pink comets in
100:29
his hair i've been to heaven they all
100:30
have highlights
100:31
what and they never say this you're
100:35
lying
100:37
this is what i'm not a non-believer no
100:40
matter how
100:41
on drugs whatever it is they'll go what
100:43
did it look like
100:47
you know their souls kind of loosened up
100:49
because they've been taking something
100:52
and what's in there will come out what
100:54
did it look like
100:56
i've had meetings at the cashier where
100:58
the lines backing up and they're
100:59
listening the bad boys are listening the
101:01
bad boys at the next one cashier comes
101:03
over
101:04
so they can hear well i'm saying it's
101:06
because of this pink hair
101:08
so i understand jesus when he said we
101:09
need you to have pink highlights in your
101:11
hair
101:11
and he can read my thoughts and i'm
101:13
thinking in my head
101:15
why and he looked at me says it's
101:19
if the lord of glory ever says to you
101:22
with all the love he has his heart it's
101:24
necessary
101:25
i don't care what he wants then he just
101:28
keeps he keeps going
101:30
we don't want you to be hidden you can't
101:32
hide anymore
101:33
we're going to market heaven with that
101:35
pink hair
101:36
we want people to know the truth we want
101:38
to know it's not boring it's exciting
101:40
it's powerful it's amazing
101:42
i want you to know as a believer the
101:44
authority and dominion that you have in
101:45
this earth
101:46
and it's okay if you cut color
101:48
highlights in your hair
101:50
you look like heaven angels
101:54
are different colors they're not just
101:55
all pasty white
101:57
glowing with white wings in a white gown
102:00
some would probably make you crawl under
102:02
your seat they have a band around their
102:04
head with eyes and that whole band
102:07
they have they have this this whatever
102:09
thing they call this thing
102:12
a breastplate thank you yes they have
102:14
eyes all through them
102:16
in the front and the back their wings
102:19
are made out of electricity or lightning
102:22
their faces are angular their eyes are
102:25
diamond shaped
102:27
if one comes in your room it's not from
102:29
hell
102:31
and some of them can look really fierce
102:33
really fierce like i have two heads
102:36
one facing this way one facing that way
102:39
they both look
102:39
front and back no matter where they're
102:41
turning they can see
102:43
some are weapons they don't need to
102:44
carry weapons
102:47
i'm more acquainted with the army of
102:48
heaven than gabriel's group
102:51
i've seen gabriel's group i know my
102:53
guardian angel i've known him since i
102:54
was little he's 40 feet high
102:56
i won't tell you his name
103:00
ask god would you tell me what my
103:03
angel's name is so i could say thank you
103:06
you're not worshiping him and they won't
103:08
let you worship them
103:10
and an army doesn't get worship they
103:11
want commands
103:13
they need orders like this army
103:18
they have generals they have privates
103:21
they have commanders
103:23
all kinds of levels in the army itself
103:26

earth it is our right
107:01
as a born-again believer having invited
107:05
jesus
107:05
into our lives when i was four and i
107:08
asked him in i saw him step in me
107:11
i was four years old don't discount your
107:15
little kids
107:18
i liked it so much when i was five i did
107:19
it again
107:23
so in book one i said i got born again
107:25
at four on book five
107:26
book two hey don't tell me there's five
107:29
and book two i said i got saved to five
107:31
and this woman
107:32
who loved everything i had been saying
107:34
and receiving it when she found out she
107:36
said you lied
107:38
this is a legalist minded person you
107:41
lied you said you were born again at
107:42
four and you said five you didn't even
107:43
remember
107:45
i said excuse me i did it twice maybe
107:47
you should
107:51
maybe you should do it again
107:55
in the assemblies of god we got saved
107:57
every week
107:59
we did
108:02
whether we needed to or not we still got
108:04
saved
108:06
oh the baptist did it all the time
108:08
they're doing everybody's neighborhood
108:09
in their yard it doesn't matter
108:10
the baptists are great soul winners
108:12
y'all
108:15
they really are they're very bold
108:17
[Music]
108:21

108:23
in your home
108:28
they'll want to give you their
108:29
watchtower magazine burn it
108:32

108:37
all false religions are run by one
108:39
person that satan
108:40
is called an antichrist spirit remember
108:42
jesus talked about it
108:44
that means anything is against christ's
108:46
sovereignty
108:47

108:51
his his anything is against that that
108:54

calvary assembly of god i was there
109:38
invited with a lot of other prophets who
109:40
were
109:41
taken out of their box because jeff
109:42
jansen was in charge
109:44
and he never has a program or a schedule
109:47
you flow with him
109:48
so all these great leaders are all
109:51
sitting up on the platform and
109:53
and jeff would just say get up there and
109:54
start speaking and they're like
109:56

01:07
y'all can sit down
01:20
okay
01:23
that's good well
01:28
there's a lot of glory in here
01:35
whoa
01:39
yeah if you have never felt it it's real
01:43
the more sensitive you are why do some
01:45
people fall not fall
01:47
it's not that something i want to do the
01:49
more sensitive you become
01:54
to him to jesus christ the more
01:56
sensitive you become to the holy spirit
01:59
and their presence because he's always
02:01
with you
02:03
and actually they're always talking to
02:05
you
02:07
when you learn how to tune that in tune
02:09
the world out and tune it in you begin
02:10
to hear them
02:12
and it might be that still small voice
02:14
but it's still them
02:16
i always say them you hear me say them a
02:17
lot i said it so many times someone said
02:20
who are you talking about the trinity
02:26
it's not one without the other right
02:30
they've always been they've always
02:32
existed they have no beginning no end
02:34
i like the no end part
02:37
i get crazy questions sometimes like
02:39
will this all end and everyone just stop
02:41
existing and went no way
02:45
that's never gonna happen and you may
02:48
never know
02:49
everything about them
02:53
because you'll always be learning and
02:55
growing closer i'm talking about in
02:57
eternity
02:57
i mean you know you're actually already
02:59
in eternity if you're a believer
03:01
it's not like you're waiting on it okay
03:03
it's just another season of your life
03:07
but while you're here you have all got
03:10
important commissions
03:12
but if you're alive in this time
03:16
you have extremely important commissions
03:20
and one of those will be carrying the
03:22
glory
03:24
a lot of people i won't be talking about
03:26
america obviously thank you everybody
03:28
for wearing your red white and blue
03:32
[Applause]
03:34
the angels are in this room are wearing
03:36
red white and blue just so you know that
03:38
the ones that signed here especially
03:40
because i asked
03:43
would you please wear red white and blue
03:47
god loves the red white and blue it
03:50
represents his son i don't know if you
03:51
ever knew that those stripes what do you
03:53
think that represents
03:56
it really does that's what it represents
03:59
so the red and white and blue is his
04:03
our president is his our country is
04:07
his
04:12
you ever wonder who to vote for always
04:14
vote for life
04:15
say life remember what god said i offer
04:19
you
04:19
you choose life or death but choose
04:23
life right so this time it is about a
04:27
man
04:28
and god chose that man i talked somehow
04:31
god talked mostly last night if you
04:33
weren't here
04:35
we actually heard from god himself
04:37
speaking
04:38
and he does that with me pretty often
04:42
the more freedom in the atmosphere where
04:45
i go
04:47
the greater change you have of hearing
04:49
from him because
04:50
i didn't know he was going to do that
04:52
but he has permission to use me any way
04:54
he wants to
04:56
i hear prophets say well i think the
04:58
word of the lord is
05:00
and what they need more maturity
05:03
it's okay to open your mouth and let god
05:05
speak
05:07
and he does he does
05:11
and he always will do that he loves to
05:14
speak to his people
05:15
but even people he'll speak to people
05:17
who aren't
05:18
his yet catch him up to heaven when they
05:22
come back they want to know him
05:24
they want to know jesus christ i know
05:27
several times where things like that
05:28
happen not in my meetings
05:30
people haven't caught up a few times in
05:32
my meetings mostly when they leave
05:35
a lot of people see their guardian angel
05:37
after they leave
05:38
the meetings and that's okay don't
05:41
worship them
05:42
[Laughter]
05:43
they won't let you that whole thing that
05:47
has gone through the church for
05:48
so many years uh it went from don't
05:52
worship angels to don't talk to them
05:55
have nothing to do with them and and yet
05:58
in the bible itself
06:00
not just the new testament in the old
06:02
testament they actually had a little bit
06:03
more freedom
06:05
because there was no internet there was
06:07
no fake news
06:08
there was no liberals or legal list of
06:10
people who said oh don't do that
06:13
because they didn't know yet and and i
06:16
can't i count on both
06:18
hands how many and some weren't even
06:21
like
06:22
great men and women of god they were
06:23
just people who god needed to do
06:26
something
06:27
and he would send angels why in the
06:30
world do you think they have
06:32
couriers now anyone who's been in a
06:35
courier service
06:37
understands how important that is heaven
06:40
has
06:40
courier angels they're under gabriel
06:43
they're messengers couriers
06:46
they have all types of angels worker
06:48
angels
06:49
uh ones that deliver things some that
06:51
come and record
06:52
things every person whoever got born
06:55
again was recorded by
06:56
angels is that important to god
07:02
it was all recorded and not just what
07:05
people saw with their natural eyes
07:07
but what was happening in the spirit
07:08
realm when you get born again
07:10
the father son and holy spirit are all
07:12
present when that happens
07:16
because the father is fiercely loves
07:19
everybody
07:20
and if you could see with your own eyes
07:23
i know when i was born again i was four
07:26
i knew exactly what i was doing
07:28
i saw jesus step inside of me i've
07:31
always been a seer
07:33
so i would not talk a lot about it to
07:34
anybody when i was real little
07:36
but i'd always see angels and sometimes
07:39
the other guys
07:40
you know so i'm not really afraid of
07:42
them because i know that they're the
07:43
losers
07:46
and they have no power over me
07:49
now i'm not letting them beat me up
07:51
they're not going to kill steal and
07:52
destroy
07:54
anything of mine and that should be
07:56
coming out of your mouth
08:00
it's called ruling and taking dominion
08:03
jesus said occupy until i come
08:05
he didn't say stood on your rapture rug
08:09
so the holy spirit had us make some pens
08:12
that said roll up your rapture rug
08:15
he actually came and said that tell
08:16
everybody roll up your wraps your rug is
08:18
not going to happen right now
08:20
stick it in the closet maybe someone in
08:22
the generations to come might want it
08:24
you need to get your crown on
08:29
it's more important to wear your crown
08:30
than sit on your rapture rock
08:32
because if you sit on the rapture road
08:33
you'll probably never get to wear your
08:35
crown or use it
08:39
we all have crowns when you're a
08:41
believer
08:43
but what you do with that that that
08:45
represents your authority and dominion
08:47
when you get christ you get so many
08:50
things
08:51
but at that ceremony that's what heaven
08:54
calls
08:55
when somebody repents receives christ as
08:57
a savior
08:58
the father reaches inside of himself
09:00
takes a stone of fire and puts it in
09:02
that person's spirit man
09:04
and that's what brings light
09:08
it puts light in your spirit man that
09:10
light can grow and grow and grow
09:12
the more you pursue christ the more you
09:14
obey the more you're willing the light
09:16
grows and grows and grows
09:19
and i can look at people and already
09:20
know what have you been doing
09:23
or yay
09:24
[Laughter]
09:27
some people are never told what you've
09:29
been told what you're hearing
09:31
but but from the moment we receive
09:33
christ that is the first step
09:35
the most necessary thing yes but after
09:37
that you're supposed to run your race
09:39
and go from glory to glory and you are
09:42
more than a conqueror it's not like
09:44
you're conquering you're taking the
09:45
territory
09:46
that christ already conquered for us
09:50
to occupy means take
09:54
authority and take dominion and take
09:56
territory
09:58
because we rule in the spirit realm
10:02
but where you live the ground
10:06
the air any water bodies wild around you
10:09
anywhere
10:10
you have rulership over all of that
10:14
in the spirit realm you have a realm
10:18
it comes with your christianity with
10:21
your salvation
10:22
and also at that time christ also takes
10:25
something from himself
10:26
the anointing he walked in
10:30
this is all scriptural how about that
10:31
this is the best part
10:33
i know the word i was raised from the
10:35
time i was a little baby
10:36
my dad devoured the word and he actually
10:39
lived it
10:40
he loved his enemies like he did his
10:42
friends
10:44
so there was no skin color to us
10:47
they were people that god loved and that
10:49
we cared about very much
10:51
we have adopted members of our family
10:53
from almost every race
10:55
my mom's sitting right there when people
10:57
meet her i want you to be my mama
11:01
so she had 15 but there's like 16 17 18
11:04
19
11:05
we ran out of numbers because they want
11:08
to be a part
11:10
of what we carry it's called love
11:14
so christ reaches in himself and he
11:16
takes a deposit of the anointing
11:19
he walked in
11:23
how do i know that because of first john
11:26
2 27
11:31
you see rick knows the walking bible
11:34
back there
11:36
if you want to know about a scripture
11:37
ask rick
11:39
he knows it and see rick i know this one
11:43
the word actually tells you that it says
11:46
when you receive
11:47
jesus christ as your savior you receive
11:49
a deposit of the anointing
11:53
that lives and it abides in
11:56
you guess what it doesn't go back to
11:59
heaven
12:00
it's given to you for a purpose
12:03
it is a weapon
12:07
and it's only yours it's yours everybody
12:09
has one you're a believer
12:11
but it's a deposit of the anointing he
12:13
walked in
12:14
so the father gives you something a
12:17
stone of fire
12:19
and you put more facets in it the more
12:21
you do the more you grow
12:23
the more you love the more you walk out
12:25
the word and
12:27
and carry the glory your facets the
12:30
facets and that gemstone
12:32
would blind the enemy
12:36
that gemstone also has fire on it so
12:39
here's the father giving you deposit of
12:41
himself when you receive his son
12:44
you get all of this you get all the holy
12:48
spirit is right there all right
12:50
he writes down okay i will begin to
12:53
pursue them
12:54
for me to indwell them but when you're
12:58
born again
12:59
he doesn't ignore you holy spirit is you
13:01
can say holy spirit you don't have to
13:02
say thee
13:03
he's not an it he's a third member of
13:06
the trinity he is also god
13:08
right and they all have their they have
13:11
their favorite things
13:12
like we do their next favorite colors
13:15
favorite foods
13:17
jesus is just really got this serious
13:20
thing about
13:21
sweets he doesn't want deliverance from
13:25
it though
13:28
did you know he has his own mansion in
13:32
heaven
13:34
did he walk as a man on this earth
13:37
doesn't he deserve one
13:39
jesus doesn't live in this wrong room he
13:41
visits much
13:42
many many times he's there most of the
13:45
time he's all around heaven saying hello
13:46
to people
13:48
you know just blinding you with his love
13:50
and his glory but he actually has his
13:52
own place
13:54
and it sits in this field of these
13:56
flowers that
13:57
sing and worship him all the time now
14:00
these flowers are like eight ten foot
14:01
tall
14:02
and you can't see the end of these
14:04
flowers and
14:05
his mansion is made very particular
14:08
because he likes three things
14:11
well he likes celebrations for sure but
14:14
he likes sweets
14:15
right he loves to dance
14:23
he loves being with people so his
14:26
mansion is different
14:27
he's got one massive ballroom in it
14:30
and all along the walls are these very
14:34
beautiful probably made by him he still
14:37
does carpentry in heaven
14:38
all these wonderfully embellished tables
14:41
and all of them have desserts on them
14:52
he was raised on honeycomb and that
14:54
never left him
14:58
he loved going to weddings because guess
15:01
what they always had
15:05
lots of people sweets
15:08
and they danced
15:13
so because your mansion is made
15:16
for you exactly the things you love the
15:19
things you really love to do
15:20
that you love to eat uh places and play
15:23
i mean your mansion i've seen one the
15:25
size of new york city
15:26
so don't think you have a little cabin
15:28
unless it's inside your mansion
15:31
you know he'll do if you really want one
15:32
he'll stick it in your mansion unless
15:34
your mansion looks like
15:35
you know a 50 000 square foot cabin
15:40
most mansions don't have ceilings in
15:42
them they don't need them
15:44
it's easier for the angels to fly in and
15:46
out
15:48
or the creatures in heaven that come by
15:50
to say hi
15:52
if you have trees growing out of the
15:54
floor that will talk to you and have
15:55
conversations
15:57
they come from the friendly forest
16:02
does it say that the trees clap their
16:03
hands
16:06
it does and they really do
16:10
so jesus has a one of the biggest places
16:13
of celebration
16:14
once you arrive and you have your
16:16
welcome home party in the throne room
16:18
and your family finally drags you out of
16:20
there
16:22
schambach stayed like forever
16:26
some people just love being in that
16:28
presence which is a massive celebration
16:32
they don't have funerals in heaven
16:35
they have celebrations and they have
16:37
parties
16:40
you don't need any alcohol you are drunk
16:43
on the spirit all the time
16:48
really people will step over you in the
16:50
streets of gold
16:54
because you're besotted with the
16:56
presence and the all
16:58
and the glory and the glory is one of
17:00
the things i'll talk about
17:01
this really i said god in the red white
17:03
and blue it's really about the glory of
17:05
what god's going to do with america i
17:08
thought i'd share a little bit of heaven
17:10
who's never heard anyone talk about
17:13
heaven like that
17:14
anybody if you've been there a lot you
17:18
would be
17:19
some people are afraid to i have a
17:21
commission i have to share
17:23
i i have a commission god came to me
17:26
jesus christ came to me and said the
17:27
father and i have decided to take you on
17:29
tours of heaven
17:32
that was over 20 years ago
17:35
there's no way i can be normal
17:41
when anyone dies i have a party inside
17:45
the family doesn't call me unless
17:46
they're ready to have a party
17:49
because i've been at funerals and the
17:52
and the ceiling is open
17:53
and the person who died is looking at
17:55
themselves in their casket
17:58
your spiritual body goes to heaven your
18:00
physical body is what
18:01
rest right you're going to get it back
18:05
you're going to get it back it's okay
18:07
it's going to look really good
18:11
and the day the dead in christ shall
18:12
rise that is your body
18:15
and your spirit man if you're already in
18:17
heaven you're not going to miss that
18:19
you can't you get it back first because
18:21
you come in the clouds right
18:22
with jesus you get your physical body
18:25
first and anyone left on the earth that
18:27
is born again
18:28
they get their body glorified so it's
18:30
okay to go home for half
18:32
to heaven for some rnr because most
18:35
people go i'm going to be here
18:37
i want to be here when the rapture
18:38
happens i'm like why are you going to
18:39
know about it before anybody down here
18:43
trust me they'll all know in heaven
18:44
before it ever happens
18:47
so i hope that helps some people they
18:50
miss
18:50
the rapture oh let me tell you they were
18:53
raptured when they got here
18:57
the moment you step from this physical
18:59
body
19:01
the presence of god and the love of god
19:04
consumes your spiritual person
19:06
you are seeing your guardian angels for
19:09
the first time who never
19:10
leave you they actually escort you to
19:11
heaven and they've been with you your
19:14
whole life
19:16
yay
19:20
i've always been nice to mine
19:24
they had to put up with me growing up
19:29
i wasn't bad i just wasn't a real happy
19:32
person
19:34
but anyway no i can see mine i see him
19:37
all the time and when
19:38
when god sends you into something new
19:40
for him you get more
19:43
okay you all have more than one because
19:46
one has to stay here while the other one
19:47
goes home for r and r
19:50
remember what it says that your angel is
19:52
always beholding the face of the father
19:54
that's because one is here and one's up
19:56
there at least
19:57
many people have many and they come when
20:00
you're conceived
20:02
at the time of conception life begins
20:06
because that is when your little spirit
20:07
man is
20:09
brought from heaven by holy spirit and
20:12
he
20:12
knits and attaches that little dot that
20:15
little
20:16
dot of flesh that's beginning to form in
20:18
your mother's womb
20:19
he takes your little spiritual man it's
20:22
still you
20:23
you've always been you just lived in god
20:26
played like a little child somewhere
20:28
about this big this big your different
20:30
sizes
20:31
you have these little shift things on
20:33
you swim in the river of life you run up
20:35
and down on the stones of fire you slide
20:37
down the holy mountain
20:38
you have a lot of fun you ride in and
20:40
out on the rays of the rainbow that come
20:42
out of him
20:44
but you can't go any further you don't
20:47
live
20:48
in heaven somewhere you live in him
20:53
in him we live we move we have our very
20:56
being the prophets and poets of old
20:59
have spoken of these things what things
21:01
when you lived inside the father
21:03
why is he called the father why are we
21:05
called his offspring
21:08
i hope that makes sense to your head
21:11
he carried us he carried us inside of
21:15
himself and he said when i made the womb
21:17
of a woman that's why i put water in it
21:19
so it'd be familiar
21:22
because you lived in him you played in
21:24
the river of life
21:29
he's very focused
21:32
and the father is an extremely detailed
21:35
person that's why he can put up with me
21:40
my husband he gave me was probably the
21:41
only person who ever could
21:43
because he's got five layers to his soul
21:44
he's happy if i love him and feed him
21:47
and he can fish
21:49
he doesn't have any more demands
21:53
and so god picked him before he sent me
21:58
he sent me first four years later my
21:59
husband was sent into the womb of his
22:01
mother
22:02
but god picked us and he brought us
22:04
together and 43 years later here we are
22:08
he still loves me still loves food still
22:10
loves fishing
22:16
god is very detailed
22:19
and focused when he made you and we are
22:22
so
22:23
amazingly made scientists
22:26
still can't figure out how we can do
22:28
different things
22:30
how does our body operate the way it
22:32
does it couldn't without a maker
22:35
we didn't climb out of a slime pond
22:39
the only big bang that happened was when
22:41
satan was cast out of heaven
22:44
[Applause]
22:48
that's about it that's the big bang
22:51
and it's not a theory it's the truth
22:58
nope we have all been from the end of
23:01
the beginning in the beginning
23:03
beginning to the end when we lived in
23:06
him
23:06
because he went there is that what it
23:08
says yeah
23:10
and when jesus was called the word it
23:12
was the father the word and holy spirit
23:15
until the word came to die for us
23:18
and was jesus christ
23:22
his whole life changed i mean everything
23:25
changed he had to change everything
23:29
he was all spirit he didn't even look
23:31
like he
23:32
he looked different with flesh on um
23:34
lucifer did not recognize him satan
23:37
didn't recognize him
23:38
lucifer that's who satan was before he
23:41
fell
23:42
was the most beautiful being in all of
23:43
heaven god put gemstones all over him
23:46
for a reason
23:47
in his wings all just all over him when
23:49
he would lead worship and the
23:51
rays of glory would come from him they
23:53
would hit
23:55
the gems on lucifer and throw that
23:57
rainbow like all
23:58
over heaven he was anointed
24:02
to carry that glory until he decided he
24:05
wanted to steal it
24:09
and you think about how long see heavens
24:11
already had a war
24:13
they understand the angels lost friends
24:16
did you ever think about that
24:19
they've been around together for a long
24:22
long time
24:23
and even though the army is very focused
24:26
on what they do
24:27
the army is the army they're called the
24:29
hosts
24:30
and if you met one they wouldn't want to
24:32
be called an angel
24:36
i know people who have met one
24:40
more than one but the the army is the
24:43
one i'm most connected with
24:45
and god taught me to be a commander so
24:47
you all could learn how to command
24:49
god said command you me what he's saying
24:51
is let me see you command
24:55
when you learn in the word many times
24:58
when it was either the fathers or the
25:00
holy spirit whatever they said that was
25:01
recorded in the bible
25:04
sometimes if you turn the scripture
25:05
around you see the whole
25:08
revelation in it so if you take command
25:12
ye
25:12
me me i will see you command
25:17
that's what he meant but so many
25:20
scholars were freaked out
25:23
that's revelation they were so freaked
25:26
out why would god we cannot command him
25:29
let's don't even discuss this don't you
25:31
ever talk about this in your meetings
25:34
because because and yet
25:37
no ye not that ye are gods they don't
25:40
want to talk about either
25:41
that's with the little g that just means
25:44
you can
25:45
you you inside of you you have the
25:46
ability to command the army of heaven
25:49
only as a believer if you're not a
25:50
believer none of these will
25:53
you're here listening because you can't
25:55
do any of it
25:57
you must be born again to have this
26:00
authority this dominion
26:02
and all these things that god has given
26:05
us
26:05
if he says let's make man in our image
26:08
and after the way we operate
26:10
if jesus said i give you power over some
26:12
of the power of the enemy
26:14
say that loud then why don't we take it
26:20
he says satan comes around
26:24
like a roaring lion and coming to seek
26:26
he can kill steal and destroy
26:28
he didn't say he had the right to do it
26:32
however it also says that he gives us
26:35
mighty weapons
26:36
he gives us weapons they
26:39
that not an it you don't just give us a
26:43
sword
26:43
or a gun you know although it's okay to
26:45
have those to defend yourself so i'm on
26:47
the side of keep your guns
26:50
and there's a reason why in this world
26:53
you know while there's a devil who hates
26:54
everybody and they have wicked evil
26:56
people
26:57
uh it's okay to defend yourself that's
27:00
what makes us
27:01
not a third world country it also makes
27:04
us not communist and makes us not
27:06
socialist
27:09
that's called control that's called you
27:12
have no life and you own nothing
27:14
so those people talking about that stuff
27:16
don't even know what they're saying
27:17
let's send them to venezuela
27:19
or russia let's send them to one of
27:21
those countries let them have a week's
27:22
vacation there
27:24
they come back screaming we don't want
27:26
to do that
27:31
you have power
27:36
and we have the right to rule and reign
27:37
is says so besides the fact that he says
27:40
you are kings and
27:41
priests those are royal levels of
27:44
authority and dominion
27:46
those are spiritual levels of authority
27:48
and dominion
27:49
again if you're not born again you don't
27:50
have any
27:52
this is for the body of christ
27:56
and all they're told is get saved and
27:57
hang on to jesus comes
28:01
and most denominations that's what they
28:03
tell you go get people saved
28:05
bring them in we'll pray they stay that
28:09
way
28:11
we are living examples
28:14
in every sense of the word
28:18
we don't have to tolerate anything from
28:20
hell or anything from the enemy
28:22
you know why because guess who didn't
28:26
say jesus christ if we are joint heirs
28:30
having been in law for eight years in my
28:32
life
28:33
i got a big lesson on what that meant
28:37
and you all know why is it called the
28:40
new testament
28:43
that was his last will and testament
28:47
that is a legal document
28:51
sincerely of your rights
28:55
and your inheritance and your abilities
28:58
and your authority what he put in
29:01
there's what we have
29:05
and they stand up here just read them
29:07
like they're really nice they sing their
29:09
three songs and you go home
29:11
totally unchanged unless you are
29:13
personally pursuing
29:14
a relationship with christ that's not
29:17
who we are
29:18
that's right we're not here just trying
29:20
to get by
29:24
we have given promises by jesus himself
29:28
written in his word and is
29:31
like if you took it to the court of
29:33
heaven
29:35
they would be saying well why aren't you
29:37
doing this
29:38
or saying this or why haven't you
29:40
activated this
29:42
why aren't you using their weapons
29:43
what's wrong with the army of heaven
29:45
are they not strong enough or have you
29:47
not activated them in your life
29:50
aren't you sending them against the
29:51
enemy's strongholds trying to tear you
29:53
apart and steal from you
29:57
if you went up there without asking for
29:59
stuff if you said explain this to me
30:00
that's what you would hear
30:02
well let's just unroll your bill of
30:04
rights
30:06
and clearly explain to you what we we
30:09
should and then how to use them
30:12
it is our job to train you
30:18
you come to get trained if you're not
30:19
trained you didn't get what you needed
30:23
so people say you're going to start a
30:25
church absolutely not thank you
30:27
god in heaven i'm not a pastor one of
30:30
the hardest jobs on the earth think how
30:32
many kids you got
30:34
right
30:39
i already did that
30:43
at home but you have to look at your
30:47
life
30:48
you have to look at your life a whole
30:50
different way
30:51
like what was christ saying what did
30:53
that really mean is that something i
30:55
have
30:56
he said yes and
30:59
the hard-headed man he was given because
31:01
the father said i didn't give
31:03
make it easy for my son then he takes me
31:05
back in time and i get to walk behind
31:07
the merry men and jesus on the way to go
31:09
minister somewhere
31:11
like i didn't have a vision and i never
31:13
dream i don't sleep long enough
31:15
i was there i saw people throwing rocks
31:18
at the tax collector
31:21
this is jesus's merry men following him
31:23
he's trying to ignore most of them
31:26
there is peter trying to yell at
31:27
everybody about what they were doing
31:28
wrong right
31:30
this is exactly what they did patience
31:32
that belongs
31:34
to luke we're running down the road why
31:36
did you give us up for him
31:39
this is reality right he's been a
31:41
physician for a long time he had a lot
31:43
of patience
31:44
let me tell you when you have a good
31:45
doctor you don't want to lose them well
31:46
he wasn't doing that anymore
31:48
he gave it up but they didn't want to
31:50
give him up this is exactly what i was
31:52
showing and i went
31:52
i'll never complain about my staff again
31:57
and this is early on when he had
32:00
his 12. the hardest ones to get roped in
32:05
were james and john the sons of thunder
32:08
that didn't mean thunder from god
32:11
that means they were fighting all the
32:13
time
32:14
over pretty girls who thought they were
32:17
awesome
32:19
they had to get rid of the flesh
32:22
when you think about what they became in
32:25
a three short years
32:28
it's absolutely amazing because no coach
32:30
here on the earth could believe it could
32:32
take
32:33
that many people from different
32:34
circumstances and ages and
32:36
thoughts and everything you know and
32:38
here was the son of glory
32:41
saying i saw you when you were under the
32:43
tree there earlier
32:44
talking and said what he said that
32:47
wasn't normal
32:50
multiplied the foods there was so much
32:51
left over from a couple fish
32:53
which i don't like couple fish and loads
32:55
of bread they could have had mine
32:56
i would have given them mine baskets
33:00
full
33:01
left over now that was not normal was it
33:05
when he disappeared into the spirit he
33:07
stepped into the spirit room
33:09
like this and he walked through the
33:11
people when they were going to throw him
33:12
over the cliff
33:14
he actually said he passed through the
33:16
people you know that right
33:17
people go well he went around that's not
33:20
what it says
33:22
the orthodox jews knew he was a good man
33:25
they thought he was a prophet they
33:26
caught they gave him
33:27
that benefit i know some they think he's
33:30
a prophet and when he was having his
33:31
meeting there after him
33:33
they believe because i heard it face to
33:35
face
33:36
on a tour to israel uh which they hooked
33:38
a mic on me and
33:40
with steve schultz of elijah list they
33:42
recorded every time i prophesied god
33:44
said something somewhere
33:45
and we were at the mount the precipice
33:48
and so this
33:49
orthodox jew was given his spin on it
33:52
and he said yes the crowds wanted to
33:54
kill him they didn't like it that he was
33:55
good and he was doing good
33:57
so they lowered a rope his disciples
34:00
down the side of the mountain
34:02
i saw the side of that mountain
34:06
that rope would have been 250 300 feet
34:08
long
34:09
who's going to carry a rope around on a
34:11
wagon right
34:12
it's not like a little road and i'm
34:15
thinking that's not even
34:16
in the natural and so of possible
34:20
all the believers are like just kind of
34:21
staring at him but that's what they
34:23
believe he let himself down
34:25
no but then it was my turn to give
34:27
revelation on where we were
34:30
and i said well you all realize jesus as
34:33
as the son of god although he walked as
34:35
a man that is true he also was the son
34:37
of god
34:38
but even walking as a man he learned
34:40
truth
34:41
about the spirit realm the unseen realm
34:44
it's a real place
34:45
it supersedes the physical realm that's
34:48
why angels and spiritual beings can pass
34:50
through this wall
34:52
they do it a lot sometimes you see them
34:54
sometimes you don't but they have the
34:55
ability
34:56
but but jesus learned that he himself
35:01
he was headed he had a spirit man inside
35:03
he had a body but he already learned
35:05
that he had access to that spirit realm
35:07
so when this crowd came upon him
35:10
this is all he had to do there are slits
35:12
and openings everywhere
35:14
if you step in you cannot be seen but
35:16
you see everybody around you oh yeah
35:18
like if i disappeared i would see
35:21
everybody here i could hear you but you
35:22
couldn't see or hear me
35:24
so to you i would be invisible
35:27
so what he did was when they were coming
35:29
after him he just probably backstepped
35:32
disappeared and he walked through the
35:34
bodies of the people
35:36
because the spirit supersedes the
35:38
physical realm so he walked
35:40
through the crowds right through their
35:41
bodies until he got where he wanted to
35:43
he stepped out of the spirit realm
35:45
and there he was
35:49
but guess what
35:55
we are joint heirs
35:59
and the things he did the works he did
36:04
we will do also and greater things than
36:07
that will we do
36:11
there's now i won't tell this this is
36:13
going from glory to glory
36:15
there are requirements and some people
36:17
don't like to hear that
36:19
so people who are full of their self
36:21
selfish spewing stuff these are
36:23
christians i'm talking about
36:25
because there's no way now i can tell
36:26
you this the devil knows about the
36:28
spirit realm
36:30
and a lot of people in the new age
36:31
movement have spirit guides those are
36:33
demons
36:34
and they'll take them in there but this
36:37
is the thing this is why they're so
36:38
insistent that that stuff is real
36:41
they had a real encounter
36:45
and because that doesn't mean what
36:46
you're seeing is real
36:49
that's why you must test every spirit
36:54
and almost nobody says that or talks
36:56
about that
36:58
if an angel appeared in this room and
36:59
said come and go with me
37:02
i would say are you the spirit of the
37:04
most high god who sent his son to die
37:05
for the sins of this world
37:08
and they can't lie so if he said yes i
37:11
am the father has sent you i'd go with
37:12
him
37:13
if he said nothing or looked terrified i
37:16
say
37:16
get out i evict you
37:20
get out i have nothing to do with you
37:22
and that's what
37:23
the basic probably one of the most
37:25
important things that every believer
37:26
will ever learn
37:28
when you get born again
37:31
because that's the moment the enemy
37:33
really begins to pursue you he doesn't
37:34
want you
37:35
to be he didn't want you to know who you
37:37
are see then
37:39
then he's losing territory he's losing
37:42
his
37:42
impact he won't have a way to hold on to
37:45
you
37:46
or use you but this is one of the things
37:48
jesus did he did it quite often he
37:50
taught who
37:52
fill up everybody say phillip
37:57
say in the new testament philip
38:01
travel through the spirit realm he would
38:04
appear somewhere
38:06
and then he would be gone he would be
38:09
found in another place
38:12
he traveled through the spirit realm
38:13
just like christ did
38:19
but people who sit in a church with the
38:21
pastor doesn't have an understanding
38:24
of the spirit realm the purposes god
38:26
made it
38:27
and what our rights are and how you do
38:30
this is
38:30
things you do you sent out assignments
38:32
by god and and
38:34
probably 20 40 50 60 years from now that
38:37
might be a normal way of transportation
38:40
let's say you're going to india to
38:41
preach the gospel
38:43
you may just step i don't know i don't
38:45
know how he'll do it you could step in a
38:46
certain room and then when you come out
38:48
you're in india
38:50
that was spirit realm
38:53
you don't need a passport you don't need
38:56
luggage
38:59
and when you're done you probably turn
39:01
around and step and you're back home
39:05
this is our future
39:06
[Music]
39:08
now doesn't that make christianity a
39:10
little bit more exciting
39:14
there are people who are already
39:15
connected with god with holy spirit and
39:18
have an understanding of the spirit
39:20
realm
39:21
these people who just kind of astral
39:23
project themselves out places
39:25
that's something they're doing from
39:26
their own soul it's dangerous
39:30
you're out there with no one protecting
39:33
you
39:35
helping you and you're just bait
39:39
the enemy can send these spirit guides
39:41
if you do that and they'll take you to
39:42
places and tell you all kinds of lies
39:44
about where they're
39:45
taking you and give you a commission
39:47
because you had a real encounter you
39:48
believe that was true and it wasn't
39:53
so even some pastors who know are afraid
39:56
to tell you
39:57
should you misuse it should you misuse
40:00
it or try it or something but
40:01
it is our right to have an understanding
40:04
of who we
40:05
are so did jesus do those things
40:10
and philip he's not the only one who
40:14
travels but john did it all the time he
40:15
left the isle of patmos when he felt
40:17
like it
40:19
you know why they put him there
40:22
he wasn't even in a jail because that
40:24
would be useless
40:27
john they tried killing him so many
40:29
times and they were terrified that he
40:31
wouldn't die
40:32
they couldn't even hurt him when they
40:34
boiled him in oil he probably asked for
40:35
a rubber ducky in the scrub bush
40:39
john was
40:43
sort of like peter at one time but now
40:46
he spoke with
40:46
confidence he knew who he was
40:50
he knew he was under divine protection
40:52
he was afraid of nobody
40:53
so he would say boldly whatever god gave
40:56
him when he went somewhere
40:57
so that would be the best thing we can
40:59
do is put them away from everybody
41:01
on an island
41:04
not realizing
41:08
he was in the spirit on the lord's day
41:11
which means he was in that spiritual
41:13
realm when he heard the voice he looked
41:15
up saw the door open and he was
41:17
up in heaven the spirit realm is a place
41:22
it is a place it's not just something
41:24
you say
41:25
but john who was the closest to jesus of
41:28
all the disciples who never abandoned
41:31
him not even at the cross
41:34
that's why he gave his mother to john
41:37
he had to die as his mother's savior
41:40
not as her son that's why he said mother
41:45
mom this is your son's son this is your
41:46
mother
41:49
he still recognizes that she birthed him
41:51
in heaven she's highly honored
41:52
not worshipped
41:56
she's not she's not a deity
41:58
[Laughter]
41:59
she's very much loved because it took a
42:01
lot
42:03
had divine encounter with angels a good
42:05
thing she was willing to listen to them
42:07
right
42:10
and then even joseph think about that
42:12
that was tough
42:15
when you do something great for god's
42:17
surrender will always be required
42:19
to some people that sounds like control
42:21
and so they're afraid
42:22
and if anybody's ever been in like a
42:25
occult not
42:26
occult occult that's satan's but a cult
42:30
can be a christian cult
42:32
you join it you live on land they get to
42:35
tell you what to do and not to do
42:37
it's still a form of control they think
42:39
they're doing out of
42:40
to help you but it's not some tell you
42:43
who you can marry who you cannot marry i
42:44
know people who were in one of those
42:46
and they will not sign any kind of a
42:47
document for anybody
42:49
because they were under control when
42:52
they got free
42:53
they don't want they don't want to ever
42:54
be controlled again by people so they're
42:56
not a good thing either
42:58
okay you don't need people to take you
43:01
and keep you in a compound somewhere
43:03
and run your whole life for you that's
43:05
not god
43:06
and they love and some of them love
43:08
jesus and they may have their little
43:09
church and worship and stuff
43:11
but they have no rights really
43:15
it's not a good thing it's certainly not
43:18
god
43:19
right so the i've known people who've
43:23
been through that so they don't if you
43:24
say well we have
43:26
uh this we're having everybody to sign a
43:28
covenant with us to be a part of what
43:30
we're doing they won't sign it
43:32
even though it has nothing to do with
43:33
controlling them or anything
43:35
they just won't do it they won't do it
43:37
and i said well i'll just give you
43:38
give you time pray for you you need to
43:41
release all that from your soul and be
43:42
free from that experience you had
43:45
but especially if things hurt you or
43:47
things happen to you and that
43:49
it's not good you
43:53
are responsible for yourself and the
43:55
family god gave you
43:57
and you're shaping i guess my sign to
44:00
take a drink
44:05
all this is coming to one thing it's
44:08
about carrying the glory around america
44:13
but i experienced last night yes god did
44:16
step into me and i had
44:17
waves i felt like this cloud came when i
44:20
stepped out of the vehicle
44:22
a cloud came and just i saw the cloud
44:26
and i heard the father speaking so all
44:28
the way in that's why i couldn't walk
44:31
i didn't feel like i was here most of
44:35
the time
44:36
i didn't feel like even standing there
44:38
if i moved and looked at somebody they
44:40
would go they'd go like this
44:42
and i have only encountered that one at
44:44
the time when
44:46
because this is saying what you're
44:47
willing to talk about to people you're
44:49
going to do it
44:51
he needs voices to speak about the
44:53
things he wants for us
44:55
so they know this is something he has
44:58
right
44:59
if you're living if you're playing with
45:01
sin it's not going to happen
45:03
because you're a testimony right you're
45:05
manifesting for him with these signs and
45:07
wonders and greater works
45:09
and he can't give those to people who
45:11
are going to play in the darkness and go
45:12
to church play in the darkness go to
45:14
church
45:14
and people know that and they see you
45:16
doing this stuff they're
45:18
it's gonna bring confusion so even
45:21
though people have
45:22
faked a lot of things they can fake
45:24
being in the five-fold ministry they can
45:25
fake
45:26
all kinds of things one thing they
45:28
cannot fake is carrying the glory
45:31
or the fire and manifesting for god
45:35
because he'll just
45:36
take everything away so these are
45:39
different days
45:40
these are powerful days just doing the
45:43
works is powerful
45:45
like walking on water right multiplying
45:48
food
45:49
raising the dead who've been dead a long
45:51
time
45:52
you know or just maybe a few days who
45:54
knows
45:55
[Laughter]
45:56
this is what i say if you're dead you're
45:58
dead if he wants you you're not coming
46:00
back
46:01
if these are believers if he wants you
46:03
or if he gives you a choice and you're
46:05
in heaven
46:06
be the hardest thing in their existence
46:11
to be in the presence of the living god
46:13
and his son in
46:14
and holy spirit in heaven itself
46:17
everything is alive there's more life
46:19
there than
46:19
anything ever so when they die their
46:21
body does but they don't
46:23
they step into real life they're very
46:26
much alive
46:30
declaring over you believing for you to
46:33
be
46:34
great for him instead of actually says
46:36
in the bible if they could come back
46:37
it'd be for one thing
46:39
to be a part of what's going on now
46:42
that's how important these days are
46:45
and so i've been talking quite a bit
46:47
about the days of glory
46:49
it says that the knowledge of the glory
46:52
will cover the earth like the waters
46:54
cover the sea there's two things you
46:56
need to realize
46:57
there's two thirds of water on this
47:00
earth
47:01
that's significant when he says like the
47:03
waters cover the sea that's much more
47:05
water than land
47:06
and what he's trying to say is you go
47:08
many times over
47:10
you will carry that glory you won't go
47:13
somewhere and say glory come
47:15
it'll be in you and it's released
47:19
and it does huge things when you release
47:22
it
47:25
the knowledge isn't just oh it's the
47:28
glory
47:29
it's the understanding of what it is and
47:32
what it does the knowing the
47:33
understanding
47:35
and the experiencing of it so you will
47:37
do that
47:38
and the glory grows in you like a cloud
47:42
and at one point now this happened to me
47:45
because i've been talking about it at
47:46
this little place in missouri
47:48
and went back to the products table and
47:51
i started walking back and people
47:52
started just falling and i'm like
47:54
i could feel this power of god
47:57
his power the glorious power it comes
48:00
from him
48:01
it's what's around him on the throne on
48:03
the father
48:05
his son carried it on this earth and so
48:08
we
48:08
we each get a measure remember things
48:10
are given in measures but it can grow
48:13
so i've been talking my son-in-law was
48:15
with me handling the products table
48:16
who's like an irish
48:19
he's quite a character he's born again
48:21
he's he's uh
48:22
he is fearless and so he was a great
48:26
addition to our family
48:28
it took him to be able to marry my
48:30
daughter who's just like me
48:35
prayed prayed him in and prayed
48:37
everybody else away

48:50
heart
48:53

48:59
uh and and i go to heaven all the time
49:01
non-stop would you like to be able to do
49:02

49:04
it's getting big i said the kids you
49:06
have will become prophets and seers
49:09
they'll travel to the spirit realm
49:11

you have not known my daughter for very
49:33
long
49:37

49:39
[Laughter]
49:41
and i kept trying to show my daughter
49:42
this this is not love it was like it was
49:44
like
49:45
they liked they liked the idea of being
49:47
married don't get fooled okay
49:50
you don't have to ask somebody
49:53
if you are in love
49:56
to somebody you cannot live without
50:00
that's filled with god and you are so
50:03
overwhelmed that the blessing god has
50:04
given you if you have to come up and say
50:06
do you think i'm in love
50:07
[Laughter]
50:10
no and so i told they were planning
50:15
their wedding and everything and i want
50:16
you're not going to be happy
50:17
why don't you go visit his house and his
50:19
dad was a fully in charge
50:21
baptist he had to give permission to
50:24
everybody around the table to speak
50:28
oh yeah yeah her eyes start to get is
50:30
this okay to tell stories on myself
50:33
see i've experienced this self i know
50:36
you don't want to meet the wrong person
50:39
she comes back she goes i said how was
50:41
it
50:42
the food was good
50:45
but i already knew because i'm a seer i
50:47
can see where they are
50:49
i can see what's going on when they're
50:50
not with me how about that for a parent
50:56
i know where you are right now if you
50:59
don't get out of that movie i'll be
51:00
there in 15 minutes we'll have revival
51:02
in the theater
51:09
and by the way there will be a
51:11
repentance thing you can sign and take
51:13
communion before you come back in the
51:15
house
51:19
that was growing up with me
51:25
jen's raising her hand because jesus
51:28
lived with me and my mom
51:29
they loved me since 1999 so they know
51:31
all this stuff they saw all this stuff
51:33
happen
51:33
she knows
51:36
[Laughter]
51:44
see i'm telling the truth that's what
51:47
happens when
51:48
you're here but it's the relationship i
51:50
had
51:53
and so i kept telling my daughter you're
51:54
not in love you're not marrying that boy
51:57
i'll lay down in the aisle well i'm
51:58
telling i was telling all these things
52:00
you know
52:00
we'll have deliverance service serve all
52:02
the baptists
52:04
[Music]
52:06
and i have very good baptist friends
52:08
okay
52:11
there'd be a lot of people in hell right
52:13
now if i had meant for them
52:17
but there's no way that with that was
52:19
not a match made in heaven
52:21
they'd be doing like this because my
52:24
daughter is just like me
52:26
in every way and out of the three the
52:29
only one about heads with is guess who
52:35
but they're raising their kids in the
52:37
supernatural
52:38
yeah so finally it's
52:42
good so i told my daughter i'm going to
52:46
fast
52:47
dr pepper now that for me was like
52:50
i'm pouring my life out right the
52:52
biggest fast i could do
52:53
because i only eat once a day there's
52:55
not much to eat so i'm fasting dr pepper
52:56
for three weeks
52:58
at the end of that three weeks you will
52:59
come to me and say i don't want him
53:01
anymore
53:02
but i have met this person
53:07
at the end of three weeks guess what
53:08
happened
53:10
mom how do i break up with scott why did
53:13
i think it was anything
53:15
i have met ben
53:22
she never said scott like that
53:28
she never said scott ah scott's coming
53:31
over
53:32
[Laughter]
53:34
yes bless his little heart he found him
53:37
a nice little baptist girl and they're
53:38
very happy just so you know that okay he
53:40
didn't damage him
53:43
and there was batten and i
53:46
interrogated everybody who came up my
53:48
husband laid back
53:50
you know let's go fishing man
53:51
[Laughter]
53:54
it's the only break they'll ever get
53:59
so when i met ben
54:05
oh by the way in this whole process of
54:06
realizing scott wasn't the right person
54:08
she rebelled against him she got a
54:10
mohawk
54:10
[Laughter]
54:14
her hair was like down here she got
54:16
herself a mohawk and then the holy
54:18
spirit had told her to put lightning
54:19
bolts
54:20
tattoo them on her sides get ready for
54:24
kids for today y'all
54:27
and she has uh gifted and danced highly
54:31
i mean highly anointed and so when she
54:34
was like 14 the holy spirit came to
54:36
again and said
54:37
i want you to put brass knuckles on your
54:39
feet because they're weapons of god
54:41
and they're like this long no she don't
54:43
do anything little
54:45
so she came and showed them to us after
54:47
y'all and i went
54:48
if god and god told me i did tell her to
54:51
do that
54:53
she's a sign and a wonder and she got to
54:55
minister so many places and they
54:58
she had red and purple hair i mean just
54:59
just tell me she was so
55:01
far out there in the heaven culture it
55:02
was crazy she needed ben
55:06
and the holy spirit calls him the irish
55:07
boy with charmin blarney
55:12
who pulls down you know he displaces
55:16
principalities with the army of heaven
55:21
and i went you were made for her
55:23
[Laughter]
55:26
it's worth standing in the gap for your
55:29
children
55:30
that they have the one god needs them to
55:33
have
55:36
your life is a journey but you don't
55:39
ever ever have to be in a pit
55:43
never and even if your children end up
55:46
by running with the enemy
55:48
they're up and out of home running for
55:49
the enemy just let them know i love you
55:52
i'm running after jesus
55:54
but he will get you
55:57
and they see you not messed up or upset
56:01
or torn
56:02
apart because jesus the joy of the lord
56:05
is your
56:07
you can be strong all the time
56:11
you couldn't go after them anyway
56:15
that would be havoc then you would be
56:18
torn apart
56:19
and then they would isolate you okay
56:22
they got to live their life and make the
56:23
choices
56:23
you stand in that gap i believe and
56:25
declare my child will know jesus christ
56:28
become a witness for him and we'll be
56:30
together in eternity
56:32
and i'm running after jesus and
56:33
eventually one day they'll come to you
56:35
and say i need help
56:39
if they want to come back home you
56:40
better have a list of guidelines already
56:42
prepared
56:44
don't let hell in your home because
56:45
you're trying to help your kids
56:48
i'm serious that that would be the
56:50
enemy's plan
56:52
if you're willing to follow the
56:54
guidelines i don't care if they're 40
56:56
or 30. it is your realm
57:01
you create a habitation for heaven and
57:03
god will make sure you know they don't
57:05
die in the ditch somewhere
57:08
but they have to learn they can't use
57:10
you or take advantage of you because you
57:11
love them
57:14
this is truth i want you to have a
57:17
glorious
57:18
life and you have authority over all
57:22
that junk
57:24
but the glory of god is something he
57:28
does talk about
57:30
us having and we carry it and we release
57:33
it and everywhere we go
57:34
it will so impact it's like taking
57:36
bazookas
57:37
into an area where the enemy is trying
57:40
to control
57:41
and they just shoot it really shoots
57:43
into those demons
57:44
and it terrifies them it will begin to
57:48
cover people like a cloud whole area
57:50
sometimes whole cities
57:51
will be covered with the glory you carry
57:53
somewhere it's coming from you
57:57
so when i got back to the room the other
57:59
night i was still being consumed by
58:01
this power of god that was he was here
58:04
trust me he was here and he spoke last
58:06
night
58:08
and i was thanking him for letting me
58:09
experience all that
58:11
he says i need to let you know
58:15
that glory was coming from you that
58:16
wasn't mine
58:21
that was coming from you that's what you
58:23
already carry
58:25
then i got undone
58:30
we're entering into powerful days it's
58:32
not about your age or where you came
58:34
from
58:35
what profession you have it is
58:38
about your relationship with jesus
58:40
christ
58:42
and in heaven everyone in heaven is in
58:44
love with him
58:46
everybody they still love their family
58:49
here but he is they're number one
58:53
he is so it is is a profound thing
58:57
and a high honor to carry
59:00
parts of them the fire and the glory it
59:03
all comes from
59:04
them all of it say all
59:08
that can't come from your physical being
59:10
is something that has to do with your
59:11
spirit man inside of you
59:13
and that your soul has agreed to give
59:15
god permission to do whatever he wants
59:17
to with you
59:18
and then when he says something do it
59:21
right
59:23
the more you do it the more he gives you
59:26
that's like
59:26
a job if you work well well in the past
59:28
it used to mean that
59:29
if you got a job you worked hard work
59:31
well we're honest and hard
59:33
you got promoted above everybody else
59:36
some companies are still like that but
59:38
it's always that way with god
59:41
he doesn't love one person more than the
59:42
other but some he can use more than the
59:44
other
59:46
don't let jealousy consume you don't
59:48
covet somebody else's anointing you have
59:50
your own
59:52
remember first john 2 27
59:56
the more you release the anointing you
59:57
know what the anointing looks like it
59:59
looks like a blue fire
60:02
it looks like blue fire
60:05
we're going to stir up the anointing
60:06
today and i'm going to release the glory
60:08
on y'all
60:12
but america's greatest call it has
60:16
is to be a country known because it
60:19
belongs to god
60:21
and the glory of god will cover this
60:24
land
60:26
it will create regions of light those
60:28
who refuse it will have regions of
60:30
darkness
60:32
until jesus comes all the darkness isn't
60:34
going to just evaporate off the earth
60:36
but there'll be seasons where it's
60:37
pushed back and crushed back
60:39
until it will have to have a region of
60:41
darkness to operate in
60:43
these are powerful times people who live
60:46
in the regions of glory you'll get to
60:48
choose
60:48
there won't be an in between he's
60:51
erasing the great area that says there
60:53
is no god
60:55
even in what he's doing right now
60:58
to this whole election thing he's
61:00
exposing the souls of
61:02
men as a man think is in his
61:06
soul or his heart so is he
61:10
so why are these people hating wanting
61:13
to kill wanting to control
61:15
and you know they're doing that but i
61:16
think they're dictators over states or
61:18
cities
61:20
not even realizing in their own head i
61:23
have no way to be reelected
61:24
that's right if i'm crushing the life
61:26
out of the people i'm supposed to be
61:28
leading and watching over
61:30
why would they want that again they're
61:33
moving to states where they don't have
61:34
control
61:36
because they're tired of it these aren't
61:38
even people who are christians they're
61:39
just
61:39
good moral people i call them the moral
61:42
majority
61:43
who want life who actually do care about
61:45
the life of the unborn
61:47
they may not know jesus but they have a
61:49
life they have a family they want a
61:50
future that's the majority along with
61:53
the believers who will vote trump in
61:56
because they've already they've seen
62:00
his witness and testimony is he's
62:02
already been doing that
62:04
and so the enemy satan is so terrified
62:08
because he's planning to take over our
62:10
country
62:11
and make it his own and that's not going
62:14
to happen
62:17
it isn't i don't care what the news says
62:22
they don't know how to do anything but
62:23
lie even the polls i give are like
62:26
almost
62:27
insane
62:30
the polls biden's uh 80 ahead and i went
62:32
where are the people voting for
62:35
and who would that be the ones he bought
62:38
or the ballots they stole
62:42
no even god says they're stealing even
62:44
he tells me
62:45
they're stealing ballots and then
62:47
they're going to harvest them and thumb
62:48
and dump
62:49
dumpsters and i'm going to expose it i
62:51
mean
62:52
the enemy is doing whatever he pays off
62:54
people to vote more than once and states
62:56
that you could do that
62:57
i mean they're they're really doing that
62:59
they are corrupt
63:02
and they may have been nice loving
63:04
people one point but when you give
63:05
yourself to the darkness
63:06
it will consume you to a point where
63:09
you're blinded
63:12
and you don't even know that you just
63:14
know that you really they really
63:16
really believe they're going to win
63:19
because of the
63:20
news the fake news lying
63:24
they watch it they believe the lie this
63:26
is true
63:28
hillary fainted when she found out she
63:30
didn't win she knew even though she had
63:31
no people
63:33
it's the truth she wouldn't even appear
63:36
she fainted people had to get
63:37
psychiatric help
63:40
because they were convinced in their
63:42
soul by the
63:44
lies they believed a lie so when they
63:47
didn't win they fell apart
63:50
they sincerely needed psychiatric help
63:53
and all these years have gone by they're
63:56
still getting fed with the same
63:58
lies or more lies they're so so
64:00
corrupted
64:02
they even treat their families different
64:05
some families have been separated
64:07
business partners
64:08
businesses have churches have separated
64:12
my head can't wrap around how can a
64:13
pastor say to vote for the other side
64:15
when they want to kill babies
64:19
oh it is i'm going to always give you
64:21
the truth this
64:22
is the truth you cannot side with the
64:27
darkness
64:29
and i personally know people sweetest
64:31
people you ever knew are so filled with
64:33
hate they hate hate hate trump
64:37
i can't say his name i can't bring one
64:39
thing about him and i'm like
64:42
what happened to you
64:45
they watch the fake news and
64:48
and this is the thing they're not just
64:49
watching it they're believing it
64:52
the more you believe it is real even on
64:55
the wrong side the more real it becomes
64:57
and that's what's wrong with those
64:58
people believers
65:02
you cannot choose death
65:07
you're surrendering authority over the
65:10
enemy
65:12
you do when you choose what the enemy
65:13
wants you watering down your authority
65:17
you can't you can't choose it's okay to
65:20
kill
65:22
you have given authority by christ but
65:24
you walk in the light remember that
65:27
walk in the spirit walk in the light
65:28
follow after him
65:30
we know what he thinks about it we know
65:33
what the father thinks about it
65:36
he's sending these little babies and
65:39
then the point of time he
65:41
needs them on the earth
65:45
satan has a plan this is his plan if i
65:48
can kill them remember when he killed
65:49
him first time in egypt remember that
65:51
he didn't want moses to deliver a person
65:54
to be mourned so what did he do he
65:55
killed babies right
65:57
then the whole abortion thing started
65:59
because he doesn't want somebody
66:02
to be born who will have a voice
66:05
that will speak the truth and the life
66:07
and the power of god to people
66:08
so he'll just wipe out as many as he can
66:10
so that's why that's the
66:12
truth about why abortion started that
66:14
was satan's plan
66:16
just don't let him live don't let him
66:19
laugh
66:20
his new thing he's using is
66:22
homosexuality
66:24
do you know why that all came up not
66:26
just to steal people's destinies
66:28
no babies born
66:32
this is absolute truth from god
66:36
he wants to stop god's plans
66:41
for the people he made
66:44
so whatever he can bring a lie if you
66:47
can get people to believe a lie this is
66:49
really who you are you're not this
66:50
person
66:51
you know this your other person well
66:53
guess what two guys can't have a baby
66:54
and do women get a baby
66:57
so the bottom line is he doesn't want
66:59
him born
67:01
that's why it's going to be great when
67:03
abortion is outlawed
67:15
i've seen the place in heaven where all
67:17
these little babies are kept and loved
67:18
and
67:19
nurtured and if they have family members
67:21
there they will eventually get these
67:23
little babies and they get to raise them
67:25
if their parents make it if their
67:27
parents were involved in that repent
67:29
and get born again they get that little
67:31
baby back
67:33
that's how good god is
67:37
that's how good god is so when you see
67:40
the big
67:41
or you're getting a big picture how
67:44
important
67:44
it is for us
67:47
to live our life for him
67:51
not just once a week
67:54
you go to sleep living for him you wake
67:58
up
67:58
living for him running your race
68:01
powerfully taken power and authority
68:05
over the enemy
68:07
wherever there is destruction wherever
68:09
there is evil
68:10
you can send the army to pull down
68:13
strongholds shred
68:14
platforms because all of the evil on the
68:17
earth
68:18
is still is still controlled by satan
68:21
he finds people who are willing to do it
68:23
people who don't even know there is a
68:24
god
68:25
you know and some other countries is far
68:27
worse than is here
68:28
far worse you know evil is
68:33
or the power of evil unless you go to
68:36
some of those third world countries
68:38
america is one of the greatest countries
68:40
in the world
68:41
because we're founded by christian
68:44
principles
68:45
god is on our papers that's what he says
68:47
to me all the time
68:49
one nation under god
68:53
is one of the lines satan hates the most
68:56
he don't want him he doesn't want him
68:59
involved anywhere in our lives or in
69:00
this country
69:01
but he isn't going to stop it so we will
69:04
be a living example
69:06
here the body of christ in this country
69:08
of who god is
69:11
and that he is he does live
69:14
that christ lives that we have authority
69:16
over things they're going to see things
69:17
people will begin to run after
69:19
christians
69:20
to be their friend in the in the months
69:21
and years ahead because they see things
69:23
happening to them but they realize
69:25
they're prospering
69:26
these years of prosperity and in
69:29
increase
69:30
of in every way of revelation with the
69:33
ideas and inventions god's going to give
69:35
a lot of that to believers so people
69:36
will have to get
69:37
get stuff from them
69:40
so we can't hide we can't run to the
69:43
hills and hide
69:44
take vacation but you can't preach this
69:47
gospel to the bears
69:53
and raise your children to do the same
69:56
god is a generational god and children
69:59
will be powerful in the earth
70:02
and and there will be a point in this
70:04
country at least nobody can
70:06
have abortions it will become
70:10
[Applause]
70:14
illegal
70:16
so god has his timeline and he knows
70:19
who inside him
70:22
he's already picked up generations and
70:25
said you be this
70:26
you'll be the aunt you'll be the uncle
70:28
and you'll be in this generation
70:30
20 years later this one will be born and
70:32
will carry this on and carry on
70:34
generational lines or call on
70:35
generations
70:37
and so this is why it's important when
70:38
he sends them they get to stay
70:42
amen there is something that happens
70:46
every now and then
70:47
because he's god if he sends one
70:50
and his life gets ended quickly he will
70:52
take the whole spirit back
70:55
and rescind it
70:58
that's probably the first time you've
70:59
heard that
71:02
because he has to have that
71:06
person on the earth
71:10
he has to have it he even had me share
71:12
somebody with that that they had
71:14
a baby uh it was a little a little well
71:17
i think they they thought it was why
71:18
they weren't sure
71:19
and god told me his name and called them
71:22
and said
71:22
uh he said he was struggling so he took
71:25
him but he's going to send him back
71:29
say he's god they came from him
71:35
and he does what he needs to
71:55
whether you miscarried or a baby was
71:57
aborted
71:59
um way back in the day when all that
72:01
stuff kind of started
72:03
most of the time the young people
72:04
weren't involved in that
72:06
it was pressure from the parents that
72:09
you can't live your life with a baby
72:10
hanging on whatever
72:12
the babies the second i will tell you
72:14
what their their guardian angel
72:17
which is sent at conception will take
72:19
them home to heaven and the second
72:22
of course the little baby spirit leaves
72:24
the baby body they're not experiencing
72:26
pain or suffering or anything
72:28
and they meet personally with jesus when
72:31
they're taken up to heaven he's got a
72:33
special place he meets
72:34
all of these little babies and they
72:36
actually receive him
72:38
as their savior
72:41
even in heaven they don't need to to
72:44
stay there but
72:44
they want to they want to
72:48
and so their love from the moment
72:50
they're there he has special places for
72:52
them to play
72:53
made just even for little babies this
72:55
big i've seen
72:56
an angel in the nursery holding five
72:58
little babies it's going to be in my
73:00
book three
73:02
and then from different different ethnic
73:03
groups and they were just playing in
73:05
this angel's hand it was precious
73:09
and he's made this play pond they ride
73:11
on turtles they can swim under water
73:13
breathe water
73:14
they have picnics with jesus they get
73:18
put in the pockets of the kangaroos and
73:19
they hop them around take them for rides
73:24
the nurseries are not don't look like a
73:26
clinic
73:28
they're huge nurseries it looks like
73:30
beehives
73:32
and the angels fly in and out they have
73:34
flowers growing all around these
73:35
beautiful little
73:36
gorgeous like mother-of-pearl seashells
73:39
with beautiful blankets in it and the
73:40
baby's name is over it
73:43
and the angels who work in these
73:45
nurseries will hold these babies
73:47
they sing the breath of god on them
73:50
nourishes their little baby spirit
73:52
and then they huh please
73:55
name your baby that's most important
73:59
because the angels give them a nickname
74:00
when they arrive
74:02
and that nickname is over have been to
74:03
the nursery several times
74:05
and uh when the parent decides to name
74:08
the baby
74:09
even if somebody wasn't married if the
74:12
mother can pick
74:12
a name for that baby pick one that could
74:15
be
74:16
either or you know like sydney could be
74:19
a
74:19
boy or a girl something like that pick a
74:22
name because this is what happens the
74:24
father sends for the baby i get i get
74:26
over
74:26
my own he'll send that little baby
74:30
and he'll say i have a gift
74:33
your parent just named you so no longer
74:36
are you going to be called by your
74:37
nickname
74:38
this is your name and they have a big
74:42
party in heaven for this little baby
74:45
they actually have a cake for it and
74:46
everything
74:47
and they celebrate because their parents
74:49
recognize they were there
74:52
and that they would be given back people
74:54
bring little gifts to that baby
74:57
and and they change the name over the
74:59
little thing
75:01
when a grandparent a great grandparent
75:03
gets home
75:04
they get that baby they go get the baby
75:08
they help to play with the baby raise
75:10
the baby
75:11
it grows so slowly it could be 50 years
75:14
later and your baby would still be a
75:15
baby
75:19
god is beautiful and
75:22
he loves his babies that's why he said
75:25
it would be worse than having a
75:27
millstone
75:28
i wouldn't want to be any of the
75:29
democrats right now
75:32
it'd be better for a millstone you know
75:34
how big they are about the size of that
75:35
world maybe bigger
75:36
that map a millstone that they would
75:39
grind things with
75:40
and it'd be better for you to have one
75:42
tied around your neck and thrown into
75:44
the sea
75:44
than the punishment you will get for
75:46
doing that
75:48
i think he doesn't like it
75:52
and i tell people but because god has a
75:54
heart of love if you repent
75:56
for that if you repent for doing that
76:00
and give yourself to jesus
76:02
from that moment your baby will be
76:04
excited
76:05
they know you got born again they know
76:08
you're coming to heaven that's all they
76:09
can talk about as they will be with
76:11
their
76:11
family again so yay jesus
76:19
so i have to say like god would say
76:23
every life matters
76:28
no matter what the color of your skin is
76:31
we came from the same god
76:34
and he loves all of us and he has plans
76:38
for
76:38
all of us in heaven we're a family
76:43
there's no baptist street you know
76:45
people always want to put religion on
76:47
something there's no
76:48
pentecostal street there's no you know i
76:51
can't think of the denominations
76:52
there's no baptist assembly of god
76:54
there's there's not
76:57
your mansion is made for you by the way
76:58
when you come home you come home as a
77:00
son or daughter
77:01
you're not coming home as i was their
77:05
wife
77:06
you know each other like best friends
77:08
but you come home
77:09
as the father's son or daughter
77:15
so don't worry if you're married three
77:16
times we're all in heaven you'll have
77:17
three friends
77:22
nobody owns anybody and the father did
77:25
explain this to me i love him because he
77:28
just
77:28
opens up revelation to me to share with
77:30
people there's a reason why you can't be
77:32
still married when you go to heaven
77:34
till death do you part
77:38
because from that moment you're just his
77:40
son or daughter
77:42
you don't stop loving the people on the
77:44
earth but jesus is our number one
77:47
there's only one bridegroom in heaven
77:51
and the father said this is why i had to
77:54
say
77:54
once you die you come home to heaven not
77:56
married
77:57
in heaven you are not married like on
77:59
the earth on the earth
78:01
the angels are not married either
78:03
they're not that's probably a plus for
78:04
them
78:11
they're most of them now i know some of
78:13
them actually wanted to have all spring
78:15
that way that was a wildest thing to me
78:17
why would they want to
78:19
but in heaven the angels are pretty glad
78:21
they don't have to get married
78:24
because they watch us
78:27
but god sends them on assignments i i
78:29
need a tissue
78:30
um he sends them on assignments with
78:33
somebody who's the opposite personality
78:36
if you've ever been around a comedian
78:37
you are a very focused
78:39
thank you once good enough
78:46
if you're a focused serious person the
78:48
last thing you want to be with is a
78:50
comedian
78:52
you're being sent on assignment right
78:54
you're here to rescue this person from
78:56
whatever whatever whatever
78:57
stop the enemy's attacks on them and
78:59
this the one angel i just want to wipe
79:01
them all out let's just wipe them out
79:02
get rid of them
79:03
they're done they don't deserve anything
79:06
and here's the comedian
79:07
but won't it be fun uh maybe we'll make
79:10
some new connections while we're down
79:12
there
79:13
maybe some make some new friends maybe
79:15
go have some angel food together
79:16
somewhere
79:19
and this other one is tipped off now
79:21
they don't sin
79:22
but i mean he is annoyed because this
79:25
one is rubbing him the wrong way
79:28
which is the way he doesn't want to go
79:30
like we do his husband and wife
79:33
and this could be a long assignment
79:37
and god's out there saying you just
79:39
better get along
79:42
and every now and then they'll send a
79:43
courier down there you're being watched
79:45
and notes are being made and you have to
79:50
realize too these are real beings
79:52
they have personalities they have
79:54
assignments they like certain things
79:57
they have comedians
79:59
the two that help me write books one is
80:01
that holy fierce one the other one's a
80:03
comedian
80:04
and they do steal rubbish all the fun
80:08
silly things in the book where stuff the
80:10
information was given to me by the fun
80:12
angel
80:12
the one about hellfire and all the other
80:15
stuff
80:16
was given god sent me two scribe angels
80:21
they came from gabriel and i have my own
80:24
angel he's 40 foot tall
80:26
he's behind me last night make sure i
80:28
don't fall over
80:32
when you have the life of a seer it's
80:33
different
80:36
you see operations on both sides and you
80:39
can share with people truth that can
80:41
help them
80:41
be free but if you're in the flesh you
80:44
know what happens right
80:46
to be spiritually minded is life
80:49
to be fleshy minded is death
80:52
that doesn't mean god doesn't love you
80:54
it just means he can't use you a lot if
80:56
you're always getting in the flesh
80:58
which growing up all the body knew was
81:01
to be in the flesh
81:03
unless you had a move of god that he
81:04
changed while the move was there
81:08
moves of god in this time will actually
81:11
begin to create a habitation
81:15
that's god inhabiting your whole life
81:20
so these are profound days serious days
81:23
but exciting days for us
81:26
he has really got your life in his hand
81:29
if you belong to him
81:31
but don't leave him out of everything
81:35
make room for a christ in your life
81:37
every day
81:39
and i have conversations with him all
81:41
the time
81:43
the holy spirit is my teacher who tweaks
81:46
me a lot
81:48
and the father just loves me and gives
81:50
me revelation
81:53
i wish everybody could experience that
81:56
it's like life in heaven it's like life
82:00
in heaven it is it's just like that
82:04
if you want to be with the father he'll
82:06
make himself available in heaven to be
82:07
with you
82:10
he has this beautiful place he took me
82:13
two one time i'm like
82:14
eight years old and he'll say where
82:17
would you like to go
82:19
i can take you to the past i can take
82:21
you to the future
82:23
and i said i just want to be with you
82:25
this was my answer from my own soul
82:28
and he said well you know i can show you
82:29
powerful things that happen
82:31
the great days of the great revivals and
82:34
you want to go see the welsh you want to
82:35
go visit the welsh revival
82:37
you want you want to go see this was
82:38
created on the earth you want to go
82:40
see time when it was made and i just
82:43
want to be with you
82:45
and the third time he said are you sure
82:48
you don't want to go back and see when
82:50
you were a little tiny thing in me
82:53
you don't want to see when i cast
82:55
lucifer out of heaven because he knows
82:56
i'm fierce against the enemy
82:58
i am right where i want to be and that's
83:00
what he wanted to hear
83:03
he said well that is what i wanted to
83:05
hear you say
83:07
and so then he put his arms around me he
83:09
can be as big as he wants big enough
83:11
that the world is a speck of dust in his
83:13
hand
83:14
or small enough to step inside himself
83:16
and play with all the little spirits
83:20
that's who he is so
83:23
i've gotten to a place in my life
83:25
whatever he wants
83:26
or needs i'm doing it
83:29
because nothing is worth missing
83:32
blessing him i've learned the joy of
83:34
obedience
83:36
obedience isn't like a heart thing
83:38
anymore it's
83:39
a joy to obey because it blesses him
83:43
when i love people when i share truth
83:45
when i share revelation
83:47
i didn't even really like the pink hair
83:49
but i let them do it
83:53
so i couldn't hide and these days a lot
83:55
of people won't be able to hide anymore
83:58
it'll be too apparent with the glory
84:00
coming out of you or the fire
84:02
on your head the fire on your homes
84:06
people falling out when they pass in
84:07
front of your house because of the life
84:09
of god you have there
84:11
it's because of him
84:16
you're going to be different
84:19
not normal
84:22
not normal and america was designed by
84:25
god to be a light in this world for his
84:27
son
84:28
to come and send two-thirds of the
84:30
gospel around the world
84:33
more people give to the gospel from this
84:35
country than any other nation in the
84:37
world
84:38
more people are sent from here to any
84:40
other nation to the world
84:42
because of god that's his plan he calls
84:44
america his gift
84:46
his son is the greatest gift but he
84:47
still says america is my gift to the
84:49
world
84:50
i'm not giving it to anyone else
84:53
[Applause]
84:56
so no matter what this is the thing you
84:58
need to understand no matter what they
84:59
say on election day
85:03
if it's not what you expected just
85:06
wait and see what happens
85:11
i never go by what man says i go what
85:15
god's plans are
85:17
and he is taking america back
85:24
amen he's taking it back
85:28
and from america this world will begin
85:30
to be changed
85:32
and show other countries leaders this is
85:35
the way you
85:35
run your country justice
85:39
liberty freedom and righteousness
85:43
and he will have open doors to some of
85:45
these leaders that didn't know they
85:46
could do anything but war
85:49
and the darkness would be being to be
85:51
stripped away because of our authority
85:53
we can't kill satan we can't kill demons
85:55
but by our living our life and releasing
85:58
the glory
85:59
carrying it sharing the truth about the
86:02
gospel of the kingdom
86:03
and running after what god wants in our
86:06
lives
86:07
there's no way they can escape not
86:08
knowing something's going on here
86:11
and then we'll come to america to find
86:13
jesus christ
86:15
amen so we all have a commission
86:18
and even those who don't want him he's
86:21
gonna
86:22
get some really stuff hot stuff going
86:24
right there will be great harvest in
86:26
this country
86:27
and great harvest around the world but
86:30
until he's ready it will not be the end
86:33
okay so we focus on what we're doing
86:36
right now what he wants
86:37
right now and needs right now pray for
86:40
all those people who've been feeding
86:42
themselves with lies
86:44
when trump wins it won't be good for
86:46
them
86:47
we'll rejoice and have a party but many
86:48
people will think their life has ended
86:51
because of the lies that were told to
86:52
them
86:53
and so we're going to break all that
86:55
garbage let's just stand up and declare
86:56
together something
86:59
we'll pray for him right now
87:04
i do know that eventually i'm not sure
87:06
when but some of the networks will be
87:07
taken from them
87:11
they'll just be taken from them and
87:13
given to those who will share the truth
87:14
or who will be at least
87:16
unbiased i mean the news is always i
87:18
remember the day when you actually
87:19
watched the news and it was real news
87:22
and it's consumed on with hate because
87:25
the enemy is running it right
87:28
so he's going to get unseated so right
87:30
now we all want to declare and
87:32
pray on election day especially
87:36
well we're going to thank god for
87:38
everyone
87:39
voting because you have to vote
87:42
don't forget to vote right encourage
87:44
people to vote uh but we're going to
87:46
pray for all those on the luck today who
87:48
have been filling themselves with lies
87:50
that the enemy would not talk them into
87:52
taking their life because
87:53
god did tell me some people would take
87:55
their life
87:57
because they're so their layers are so
87:59
consumed with all of that
88:00
this is the only life we can have we
88:02
will not have a life
88:04
and they'll believe it so we're all
88:06
going to take authority i'll just lead
88:08
you into something to declare
88:10
and then i'm going to release the glory
88:12
into y'all
88:14
are you ready for that
88:22
jesus christ our lord and savior
88:28
our beloved who saved our soul
88:34
we honor your holy name
88:37
we recognize your life
88:41
that you gave for us we look forward
88:44
this day
88:47
and the future to ruin
88:50
reign with you that is your desire
88:56
so right now we corporately
89:00
stand in the gap for those who've
89:04
believed a lie
89:07
and who hate without without measure
89:12
we pray for their souls
89:15
they will not be consumed with grief
89:20
when trump wins on november the third
89:24
we pray god the holy spirit
89:29
will go to those voting booths
89:32
and into the homes later
89:36
to speak to the soul of those people
89:39
to not take their life that there's
89:43
still
89:43
hope for them and we take
89:46
power over all the power of the enemy
89:51
has been controlling these lies and
89:54
these people
89:56
to bring deception we
89:59
command the army of heaven
90:02
to go right now and on
90:05
election day do you make sweeps around
90:09
this country
90:11
depart on every stronghold of satan
90:15
that is controlling them to shred
90:19
every platform of high-level spheres of
90:23
wickedness
90:25
that would like to take their lives
90:29
we say in the name of the lord
90:33
we will not tolerate those actions
90:37
we will not tolerate the enemy
90:40
ruining people's destinies
90:44
we say no more will you control
90:48
this country or run this country
90:53
or steal people's destinies
90:56
this is a time of celebration and
91:00
greatness
91:02
and we declare those people who believe
91:06
the lie
91:08
will not miss their destiny
91:11
they will become believers in jesus
91:13
christ
91:14
and great witnesses to his salvation
91:20
so be it in jesus name
91:24
[Applause]
91:27
[Music]
91:28
amen
91:32
[Applause]
91:39
oh sit down for just a minute
91:44
[Music]
91:46
there's many ways we can do do this
91:49
importations
91:51
and there's one of the ways i do it
91:53
quite often when we have
91:54
a quite a bit of people i have everybody
91:56
hold hands
91:57
it's going to be okay you won't get sick
92:00
we evict any of that we won't tolerate
92:03
any sickness in this
92:04
no we don't tolerate the virus anymore
92:07
either right
92:08
we kick it out and evict it from this
92:10
place
92:13
only each row not all the way across
92:15
okay only like this row hold hands
92:17
just this row i'm gonna come by
92:21
i'm gonna come by and i'm gonna grab the
92:23
hand of the person and literally
92:26
it will flow through every person
92:29
[Music]
92:31
i want you to picture i want you to
92:35
picture this
92:35
really happens i've done a congregation
92:38
with 3 000 people
92:40
like this and you're already sitting
92:43
so if you have to fall at least it's
92:45
backwards
92:49
the glory is the power and presence of
92:51
the living god
92:55
it comes in a form of a cloud like light
92:58
the glory is always talked about as the
93:00
light or a cloud
93:02
remember the cloud by day the fire by
93:03
night they both belong to him they do
93:06
different things inside of us baptism
93:08
and fire will burn the whole world off
93:10
the walls of your soul
93:13
like it was never there things you
93:15
things you saw
93:16
things that bothered you that's what the
93:18
fire does i've had a measure
93:20
it came in and hit me so hard when the
93:22
pastor ladies and i was thrown back into
93:24
the congregation
93:26
with a usher a seven foot usher
93:29
thrown and my body laid on the floor and
93:32
it
93:32
shook that's fire okay
93:36
and and the first time ever angels came
93:38
and took me back in time
93:41
my body was there they locked me in with
93:43
a security guard
93:44
stuck a note in my sleeve when she wakes
93:46
up my dad will come and get her
93:48
call this number i was taken back to the
93:51
tomb of christ
93:53
right after the stone had been rolled
93:55
away i was
93:56
there at that time
93:59
if he takes you the time you're there
94:02
it's not a vision it's not a dream
94:05
and i have a lot of revelation about his
94:08
resurrection
94:09
what that looked like what went on it
94:11
was really powerful and then he brought
94:13
me back and all i could do was speak in
94:14
tongues for two weeks
94:16
and i had open visions of the fire
94:19
hitting
94:20
cities whole cities and congregations
94:24
is something you don't have to ask
94:26
people
94:27
did you get baptism and fire
94:30
the glory is something that builds in
94:33
you
94:35
the more you know him spend time with
94:37
him
94:38
obey him this glory he let you
94:41
carry it for him and let me tell you
94:45
people will be seeking that out
94:47
it can sometimes be visibly seen on
94:50
moses the glory was seen on his face
94:53
remember that
94:54
because he was what with god
94:58
when you spend time with him that glory
95:01
begins to build in you
95:02
and it even says at one point the night
95:06
will be light around us in other words
95:07
it won't come upon you if you go outside
95:09
you are the light walking around like
95:12
people can't escape that
95:14
what is that light on you what is that
95:18
you get to share all about jesus and the
95:21
glory
95:22
right and then when you get into loose
95:25
and waves
95:26
it begins to it will totally wipe out
95:28
anything of the darkness around people
95:30
in buildings and that that glory cloud
95:33
it's a cloud i saw a sole cloud last
95:35
night just ruling around me the whole
95:37
time
95:38
and uh and sometimes you can hear it
95:41
it's like a shock wave
95:44
you can hear it
95:50
and i'm like the first time it happened
95:51
i'm like wow that person is really
95:53
anointed i was walking past
95:56
at the product's table and the holy
95:57
spirit was just laughing he said go just
95:59
start walking along the line
96:00
and where they went they went
96:04
and i said well this were those people
96:07
anointed he goes that was coming from
96:09
you
96:11
will let you experience releasing the
96:13
glory
96:16
and when you take it around the world
96:17
that's what happens to cities
96:21
this is for the body of christ
96:25
so you're going to get a measure of that
96:27
glory
96:28
we do it by laying on our hands if i
96:30
feel like it's not enough i'm just going
96:31
to mind touch it i might run over top of
96:33
the rose i don't know what i'll do
96:35
a greater work is walking on air
96:40
i've done that you feel nothing
96:43
but you're walking on it christ walked
96:46
on water he felt the water
96:48
walking on years of greater work
96:51
that awesome this is for us this is who
96:54
we are
96:56
it's because of who we belong to who we
96:59
give ourselves to
97:01
we have not just promises but we have
97:04
rights as believers to walk in all of
97:06
that
97:07

111:12
old-time methodist church and
111:15
i got to hear hymns in english
111:18
so the one that stuck with me was in the
111:22
garden and i don't know whether any of
111:23
you even know that old
111:26
but i i was little and i sat there and i
111:29
heard them sing
111:31
he walks with me and he talks with me
111:35
and i never said anything to my grandma
111:37
but i
111:38
thought can you really do that
111:43
and amazingly even though i went to a
111:45
catholic school
111:47
and always went to church in the
111:49
confession
111:50
none of it stuck with me not one bit of
111:53
it
111:54
it just didn't stick so when i met my
111:58
husband
112:00
who was a spirit-filled
112:03
pentecostal
112:05
[Music]
112:07
and i just saw something in him
112:11
that i knew i had never felt before
112:16
and an assembly god pastor married us
112:18
and i wasn't saved
112:22
but i did he talked with me and i told
112:24
him my children will be raised in church
112:27
my husband's church
112:29
and i will go with him so he went ahead
112:32
and married us
112:34
but as i in the first year
112:38
i had my first baby she was two months
112:40
early
112:42
she only weighed four pounds a little
112:43
bitty thing
112:45
and i started praying over my babies i
112:48
prayed over them while i carried them
112:52
and i talked to the lord and i said all
112:55
i ever want
112:56
lord for my children is that they serve
112:59
you with their whole hearts
113:03
and i don't care where you call them to
113:04
go out back the
113:07
prayer and as they
113:10
little older when they grow up i gave
113:13
them back to the lord i said
113:15
their daddy and i have raised them to
113:17
know you
113:19
now they're your your job where you want
113:21
to send them
113:23
and i've never held back on one of them
113:26
and where they want to go
113:29
so don't ever ever give up on their
113:31
children
113:32
if you haven't had children yet
113:35
start praying for them before you even
113:37
get them
113:39
and don't ever back down because i've
113:40
gone through things with some of my kids
113:44
and i just always said lord they're
113:46
yours they're yours they're yours
113:48
they're yours
113:49
sometimes you have to give tough love
113:53
don't back down from that either it may
113:56
hurt
113:57
but in the long run you those that you
114:00

00:00
how important it is for us to be here
00:02
right now
00:03
and to have revelation to live by
00:07
i know we live in this world but we are
00:09
not of this world
00:12
we are hovanians first
00:17
how many people believe life in heaven
00:19
is better than anywhere else
00:21
[Music]
00:22
and everyone who lives there thinks so
00:27
and i know people picture you know a
00:28
handful in heaven and a multitude in
00:30
hell
00:31
but you're wrong there's millions
00:35
and millions and millions and millions
00:38
and millions of people who live in
00:39
heaven
00:41
that really got jesus some of it was on
00:44
their deathbed but they got him
00:47
some of them you'd be surprised who made
00:49
it when you get there
00:53
sometimes i was surprised
00:54
[Laughter]
00:57
but i'm here to uh god calls me a
01:00
revelator if you wonder where that
01:01
started it wasn't from me
01:03
most of the things i share are not from
01:05
me
01:06
i have to say them because he asked me
01:09
to say them
01:11
but i'm a revelator i reveal things and
01:13
john
01:14
in the book of john in revelation he
01:17
also was a revelator
01:19
and i've had people say the craziest
01:21
things to me well why do you say that
01:23
that's not anywhere in the bible there's
01:24
nothing about revelation in the bible
01:28
apparently you have not read the last
01:31
chapter
01:34
that's not a title or something that's
01:36
actually something that happened
01:38
it is a thing it's revelation from the
01:41
father
01:41
not from man and if it was important
01:44
enough to put
01:45
in the word of god then it's important
01:48
enough to still share it today
01:51
and i know i get a lot of revelation i
01:53
got new stuff today i got brand new
01:55
stuff today just sitting in the hotel
01:57
room
01:59
and jen said one thing to me and a
02:01
portal open and revelation on what she
02:04
asked me pour down from heaven
02:08
um that's not the first time it happened
02:10
but not not as much as i got
02:12
it didn't stop it was still going and i
02:15
finally had to uh
02:17
stop and go out the hallway of where we
02:19
were eating in the hotel and
02:21
just record what he had told me so fonda
02:23
was so much
02:25
and one of the things he did talk to me
02:27
about today
02:28
was kavanaugh yeah
02:33
he talked to me about kavanaugh and the
02:35
supreme court
02:37
and justice for america and so i will be
02:40
talking about this wearing my
02:42
my red word white and blue here and even
02:44
my boots see
02:45
they're red white and blue you have me
02:48
get those
02:53
i i got these from jones boot company
02:57
in missouri yes i think they're the
03:00
second or third largest in america
03:02
and i know by mentioning their name to
03:04
give a lot of money to the gospel
03:08
and i think it's third generation now a
03:10
very good friend of ours um
03:12
and a friend of mine daughter and her
03:14
husband my son-in-law
03:16
they're very close friends and he
03:18
recently took over
03:19
he's young he really recently took over
03:22
the hogue company
03:24
they started as a yarn distributor not
03:26
yarn but twine
03:28
uh and the holes were said no they
03:29
didn't sell yarn to bail the hay with
03:33
i don't know a lot about bailing hay but
03:35
i know you need more than yarn to tie it
03:37
all together
03:39
and they started you know doing that and
03:41
they're known all over the world
03:43
really they sell that but then they went
03:45
into the boot industry and
03:46
when i do go they sell to me like
03:48
one-third the price so i have a lot of
03:50
boots
03:51
and every time i go there to minister
03:53
they get me more boots but i wasn't
03:54
there this last time
03:56
uh god said why don't you get those with
03:57
the red white and blue on we like those
04:01
and i've worn them a lot especially if
04:03
we're going to talk about america
04:04
uh heaven wants me to wear red white and
04:06
blue
04:08
and i think today they're all wearing
04:10
red white and blue in heaven
04:13
if you if you think they're disconnected
04:15
from the things going on this earth
04:16
you don't know them they're very much
04:20
involved in what we are doing
04:22
because they're all declaring over the
04:24
destinies of all of us who are here
04:25
right now
04:27
those who finished the race and they
04:29
moved to heaven by the way they didn't
04:31
get lost
04:32
you don't need to tell people i lost my
04:34
father i lost them no they moved
04:36
that's right you know my father moved to
04:39
heaven
04:40
that's the greatest place you couldn't
04:42
even find it on this earth
04:44
having more fun than they ever had in
04:45
their life
04:47
they're existing to live yeah
04:51
you know down here a lot of times we
04:52
feel like we live just to exist
04:59
okay people some don't understand that i
05:02
do not believe that you
05:03
your whole body sleeps when it dies your
05:06
soul
05:06
never sleeps not now and your spirit man
05:09
never sleeps either
05:10
there's both spiritual things they're
05:12
wait 24 hours a day
05:14
and let me tell you they'd be bored in a
05:15
casket
05:19
if you went right now and laid in the
05:21
casket and shot that lid that's what it
05:22
would be like
05:24
if all of you stayed there but that's
05:26
not what happens it's not what the bible
05:28
says it says to be absent from the body
05:33
that means something moved out of there
05:34
right yes
05:36
it moved out because this is just like a
05:39
covering this is just a little thing
05:40
that you know holds all the stuff
05:41
together inside
05:43
and uh and right now it's temporary
05:45
because when you get it back one day
05:47
it will be glorified it will be
05:51
supernaturally glorified one day and
05:53
everyone who lives in heaven knows
05:54
that's going to happen to them one day
05:57
and it's going to be fantastic but we
05:58
have a mission
06:00
and a commission right now on this earth
06:03
to do things
06:04
never done before we are a supernatural
06:08
people a supernatural generation living
06:11
on this earth
06:13
that was made by the god that we love
06:15
and that we serve
06:16
and they're all excited up there about
06:19
this country
06:20
now i will assure you he loves the world
06:23
the world and the fullness thereof
06:24
belongs to the
06:26
lord it does and he is also very
06:29
interested in what's going on
06:31
he still comes down here a lot he
06:33
appears to a lot of people get messages
06:35
to people
06:35
he actually does it to me a lot also so
06:38
it's not like he moved up there and just
06:39
stayed there forever
06:41
he does go back and forth a lot he does
06:43
come in himself and say things to people
06:46
he's appearing to the jihad
06:51
so how about that's that's that that is
06:53
the
06:55
the i guess the most i don't know how to
06:57
speak
06:58
to introduce them to you but they're not
07:00
normal muslims i'll just tell you that
07:03
uh the jihad many of them are interested
07:06
in wiping out a lot of stuff on the
07:07
earth
07:08
they don't know god they don't know
07:10
jesus christ
07:12
but he is in person coming to them and
07:16
there are a lot of them getting
07:17
saved it's part of shifting nations
07:20
right now and so nothing is going to
07:23
seem to be impossible
07:24
and even what happened in the supreme
07:27
court
07:27
a lot of people would say that was never
07:29
going to happen i knew it was going to
07:31
happen
07:31
because i do know god's plans for this
07:34
country
07:35
and i'm telling you it's going to be
07:37
fantastic to live here
07:40
and at the end of 24 years it will not
07:42
even look like or sound like
07:44
like the same country it will be beyond
07:47
better than it was
07:48
[Applause]
07:52
everywhere in this nation in the most
07:55
unexpected places
07:57
and i'm telling you he's coming to
07:58
consume us in this nation he's going to
08:01
make
08:01
an example for other nations to follow
08:05
if they want god amen that's the pattern
08:08
if they want god and they want success
08:11
they want employment
08:13
for their people if they want their
08:14
people to be free to be safe
08:17
to be prosperous then god's going to
08:19
make our country
08:20
an example of that because of him amen
08:23
and so we've been very much involved in
08:25
the last elections
08:27
and i'm excited about november
08:31
i'm excited about the midterm elections
08:34
it's going to be just like it was before
08:36
it's going to turn the map red
08:49
and i know uh if you watch the fake news
08:55
and let me tell you this people if they
08:57
were smarter
08:59
they wouldn't be beating everyone up and
09:00
accusing them wrongly you know
09:02
they they don't even know what they're
09:03
doing in today's society
09:05
with the internet with twitter you know
09:07
with the podcast
09:09
however we are we're available
09:10
everywhere 24 hours
09:12
a day you can talk to people you know on
09:15
this
09:15
online everything everybody posted but
09:18
you can't hide it anymore
09:20
and that's really a good thing because
09:23
god can't be hidden anymore
09:25
and the righteous things can't be hidden
09:27
and justice and freedom cannot be hidden
09:30
what's being done right can no longer be
09:32
hidden by the other side that doesn't
09:35
want anything good
09:37
really i'm sorry for them sometimes that
09:40
they
09:40
they can't see what they're doing or
09:42
saying they're hurting their self
09:46
and they and what their plan is would
09:47
hurt generations even more
09:50
than what we have been affected already
09:53
and so that's why god put someone in the
09:54
white house
09:56
who knew what to do in the situation who
09:58
wouldn't back down wouldn't be
09:59
bought you know couldn't be used
10:01
couldn't could not you can't put fear in
10:03
him
10:04
and i tell people tonight don't waste
10:06
your time anymore
10:10
you're not going to impeach him not ever
10:14
he will be there for eight years whether
10:16
anybody likes it or not well heaven
10:18
likes it
10:21
and i remember when god said from the
10:23
time he takes the
10:25
the seat in the white house america will
10:26
not have one boring day
10:30
and we haven't have it
10:35
and you know god did anoint him to
10:37
influence
10:39
because the influence he has is for good
10:42
yes
10:43
it is for good he gives a space for god
10:46
whether you know it or not he does know
10:48
him he's still
10:49
new in that but he does he as we see
10:51
jesus christ as the savior i'm talking
10:53
about our president
10:54
and he's very focused on not letting god
10:57
be shut out of our country
11:01
and that alone is just that the
11:04
blessings that come
11:06
upon our country just because he
11:08
recognizes
11:10
there is a god and this country belongs
11:13
to god and i don't know how many times
11:14
he's already said god bless america god
11:16
bless the people
11:17
and i still think one of the most famous
11:19
things he said and his acceptance speak
11:21
to us i'm here to give your country back
11:23
to you
11:26
and i don't remember any other president
11:28
ever saying i'm here to give your
11:29
country back to you
11:30
because you know i don't think a lot of
11:32
people remember it's for the people
11:35
by the people yes is that right
11:39
yeah and so we do have a lot of say i've
11:41
never in my life gotten so many texts
11:44
and surveys never in my life from you
11:46
know you think this solicitor
11:48
at your door you know or all these other
11:50
people calling you on the phone to take
11:52
uh you know asking to do surveys uh our
11:55
president has asked me
11:56
for more than any other company i know
11:59
in america
12:00
has a has sent me a surveys on my phone
12:03
all the time and
12:04
emailed it to me and texted it to me and
12:06
if you're giving me your number you're
12:07
going to get text
12:08
i'll tell you that about everything
12:12
and so he definitely is what god said he
12:14
was that he's an
12:16
all-american boy who was all for
12:19
america and i won't ever stop talking
12:22
about it because god won't let me
12:24
stop talking about him he said my voice
12:27
is going to be heard
12:28
of what i think what i plan and what is
12:31
actually going to happen
12:32
yes and don't listen to what anyone else
12:34
says because i have the final word
12:37
that's my that's my my boy this that i
12:40
put in the white house
12:42
and he said i made him a certain way and
12:44
he was out of
12:45
all of the people in the land right now
12:49
anywhere in this country he was my
12:51
choice
12:53
amen he said i will back it up
12:56
and the people will love him even though
12:58
some may not like that they'll still
13:00
benefit from it
13:01
and there's already been like two
13:03
million jobs created
13:05
amen and our borders are safer they're
13:09
going to get safer
13:10
and i can tell you that part of the
13:12
other side wants
13:14
no borders whatsoever
13:17
that's not wise everybody say that's not
13:20
wise
13:22
i don't want that do you want that no i
13:24
don't either
13:25
because it it protects us right right
13:28
we're not a mean
13:29
hateful special country you can come in
13:31
legally
13:32
yeah we don't say you can't come you
13:34
come illegally so we know
13:36
who is criminals and who are not
13:37
criminals who are terrorists who are not
13:39
terrorists
13:40
because there wouldn't be much of a
13:41
country left amen
13:44
so we have some really good solid plans
13:46
uh
13:47
that would be god and and our government
13:50
right now
13:51
has some really good solid plans for
13:52
this country and i'm really excited
13:54
about it
13:54
uh the prosperity the joy the
13:57
celebration
13:58
uh the holidays being brought back
14:04
i will be celebrating christmas in a big
14:06
way
14:07
we make a birthday cake for jesus we've
14:09
always done that when i was growing up
14:10
we had a birthday cake for jesus
14:13
he likes some honey in it by the way
14:16
but he does love sweets and if you have
14:19
a sweet tooth blanket on him
14:21
or joint heirs with christ remember that
14:27
who would have ever thought
14:33
one thing i have found out in my many
14:36
encounters that i have in heaven
14:39
with god i mean before it was always
14:41
jesus who would walk through the walls
14:42
of my home and
14:44
he'd have me sit down and he would say
14:45
things to me like face to face like i'm
14:47
looking at you
14:48
and uh i had not ever got accustomed to
14:51
that and still get undone but when the
14:53
father
14:54
comes you know uh they have the same
14:57
heart
14:58
they have that same holiness in them but
15:00
when the father comes himself
15:02
it does something to the inside of me
15:04
that my dad
15:06
my my permanently always daddy where i
15:10
lived and who
15:11
who took care of me and held me and it
15:13
says in the bible that he was called you
15:15
know he's called the mini-breasted when
15:16
i'm talking about the father
15:18
he carried us inside of him like a
15:20
mother carries the babies in the womb
15:23
and i love the little things he would
15:25
tell me that he would tell to a little
15:27
child anywhere
15:28
he said you know i put water in the womb
15:31
of the mother
15:32
so it'd be something that would be
15:34
familiar to that baby
15:36
because when you lived in me you played
15:38
in the river of life
15:40
inside of me i never thought of that not
15:43
ever in a million years would i have
15:45
ever
15:45
and yeah i knew that i mean i knew that
15:47
there was water it protects the baby it
15:49
keeps the float you know there's all
15:50
reasons why we have
15:52
and i have birth three children so i
15:54
understand all that
15:55
and uh but i never considered the fact
15:58
even knowing the river of life was
15:59
inside the father
16:01
and it flows out of him it's never
16:03
ending
16:04
you can't see where it comes from at all
16:07
but it's it's
16:08
never ending and we would play inside we
16:10
would swim
16:12
we'd swim under the water run on top of
16:14
the water
16:15
jump on the stones of fire he has this
16:17
massive
16:18
mountain the highest line i've ever seen
16:20
was inside him
16:22
and we would run and slide down that
16:24
mountain from the water flowing in it
16:26
then we would jump on the stones of fire
16:28
and we played we played like little
16:30
children we played
16:32
we didn't have to decide what we were
16:34
going to eat where we were going to live
16:35
you know what we were going to do
16:37
and then we could move out we would jump
16:39
on the rays of the rainbow to come from
16:41
inside
16:41
them they would jump on and we would
16:43
ride in and out on those rays of the
16:46
rainbow because in him
16:48
we lived we moved we had our very
16:51
existence and so and that's what that
16:54
talks about in the scripture
16:56
we came from him everybody came from the
16:59
same place
17:00
we all all people whoever were born on
17:03
this earth
17:04
lived in him first it said in the bible
17:06
he knew us before we were born
17:08
you know he would talk to us he would
17:10
play with us
17:12
because we lived in him that's how he
17:13
could see us that's how he could know us
17:15
he wrote every day of our life in the
17:17
book before he sent us
17:19
how about that and there's other scrolls
17:21
in heaven that talk about
17:23
the plans he has for you and sometimes
17:25
you'll be partnering with the host of
17:27
heaven
17:27
or maybe with gabriel's group and
17:29
helping to bring the body parts down a
17:31
gabriel's group bring those body parts
17:33
down a lot of people have prayed them
17:35
down
17:36
you know and and really that's necessary
17:38
for us to do that we have to invite
17:40
heaven that's why we invite jesus christ
17:44
yes you need to get jesus without asking
17:46
him to come in is that true
17:48
this is some of the most powerful
17:50
revelation i was ever given when i was
17:52
in heaven when he caught me up to heaven
17:54
he said there is a protocol you must
17:57
invite you have to invite my son
18:01
for him to come live in you you're going
18:03
to invite the holy spirit
18:04
to come and indwell you and he says so
18:07
when you invite that gives
18:09
us permission to do something with that
18:12
invitation you have to invite the host
18:15
of heaven
18:15
to be one of your personal weapons that
18:18
will war against the enemy and pull down
18:20
the strongholds around you
18:22
put on strongholds of darkness and uh so
18:25
there's new revelation
18:27
that plan of god that we will actually
18:30
help complete the destiny of the armies
18:32
of heaven
18:33
he's already always had that plan while
18:35
we lived in him
18:37
we weren't even here the earth wasn't
18:38
even here he made plans for that
18:42
because see the the armies of heaven
18:43
can't just go attack
18:45
wherever they want to they're an army
18:49
our army well unless trump's over yeah
18:52
anyway
18:54
most armies just can't go attack what
18:56
they feel like well this is basically
18:57
we're going to take our own weapons
18:59
without any orders from headquarters
19:01
we're just going to go attack wherever
19:02
we want to
19:03
that would not make sense down here are
19:06
the military
19:07
no matter what military or what country
19:10
they all pretty much have the same
19:11
way they handle that they have officers
19:14
over them but first they train them is
19:16
that right
19:17
they get trained and i tell people all
19:20
the time this is a good way to explain
19:22
it to you
19:22
you want to be an airline pilot you go
19:25
apply with delta or american airlines
19:27
you're not going to walk in the next day
19:29
and get your license
19:31
i wouldn't fly on that plane
19:34
our lives as believers it's the same
19:37
thing
19:39
but the angels in heaven it is the same
19:41
way
19:43
they have a protocol of how they operate
19:45
in heaven the government of heaven
19:47
the army of heaven and gabriel's all the
19:50
watcher angels
19:52
and the healing angels and the body
19:54
parts angels
19:55
worker angels scribes i can i can make a
19:58
whole long list
19:59
that are under gabriel one of the
20:02
guardian one of the um
20:04
my mind's going now uh one of the
20:06
archangels thank you holy spirit
20:09
um the archangels are fantastic
20:12
they have a higher level of
20:14
understanding
20:15
of knowledge inside of them because
20:17
they're over like whole
20:19
groups of angels and the hosts actually
20:22
prefer to be called the host
20:26
when it says a great host in the bible
20:28
that's the army
20:30
okay it talks about angels and leaders
20:32
of angels that's usually gabriel's group
20:35
and gabriel's work look beautiful most
20:38
all of gabriel's the angels under him
20:40
look like us you probably couldn't tell
20:43
sometimes if it was an angel or not they
20:45
can hide their wings
20:48
many times i have i don't have arguments
20:51
but people try to argue with me
20:52
that angels don't have wings because
20:54
i've seen them and they don't have any
20:56
and so you didn't see all of them okay
20:59
you didn't see
21:00
all of the all almost every angel i've
21:03
ever known or seen which is probably
21:04
billions of angels at this point
21:06
they all have wings some are made out of
21:08
energy some are made out of color
21:10
some are made of light you know we
21:12
always think they have to have feathers
21:14
you know like a bird and if they don't
21:16
have them they don't have them
21:17
but they're probably invisible some can
21:20
have them when they need them
21:22
and not have them i have news for you
21:24
the father has wings
21:30
so there's jesus he came with healing in
21:34
his
21:40
he does he doesn't always show them
21:45
he does have wings mighty wings the
21:47
father has powerful
21:48
mighty wings you know about psalms 91
21:52
right
21:56
he has wings holy spirit has wings
21:59
the holy spirit is huge he's really tall
22:03
i have never seen him he's invisible but
22:06
he does have an appearance it's the best
22:08
way
22:08
to describe him i used to ask god how do
22:10
i describe him
22:12
he lives in me i hope he lives in you
22:15
holy spirit lives in me he's my best
22:17
friend
22:18
yes and i thank him all the time the
22:20
most simplest things
22:22
i need or i can't find or i don't know
22:26
he'll show me bring it to me or tell me
22:29
without me even asking
22:32
and so he talks to me 24 hours a day
22:36
gets on to me a lot that's what best
22:39
friends do right
22:40
yes and he's also god i don't know why
22:44
people
22:44
want to put him in a different category
22:47
he's god
22:49
he can be worshipped he can be praised
22:52
and so he's part of the trinity they're
22:54
all holy they're all the godhead
22:57
and they are uh even though their
22:59
parents may
23:01
differ a little bit their heart is the
23:02
same they are for
23:04
us they are not against us they have
23:07
more hope
23:08
for us than anyone else in existence
23:11
and so uh they're fantastic
23:14
to to get to know i want everyone here
23:17
to know them
23:18
you know in a in a really awesome way
23:22
and but their goal always is for us to
23:25
be greater
23:27
to be more prosperous to have their
23:29
heart
23:30
to have their understanding to know
23:33
their ways
23:34
to want their will it's really important
23:37
to have those things
23:38
if you're going to be successful in this
23:40
world and when you get to that place the
23:42
devil
23:43
will be terrified of you he's already
23:45
afraid of you
23:47
he doesn't attack you because he's angry
23:50
he attacks because he is very afraid
23:54
he's afraid you'll become you will
23:55
become more and more like them
23:58
amen he really is he doesn't want you to
24:01
have revelation
24:02
he doesn't want you to know how to be
24:04
greater he doesn't want you the devil
24:07
doesn't want you to know how to go in
24:08
the spirit realm and
24:09
or execute the government of god on this
24:11
earth or how your soul to prosper
24:14
especially he's most terrified
24:16
that he does not want your soul to
24:17
prosper he doesn't want you to live in
24:18
divine help
24:19
he doesn't but that's just too bad
24:24
because in this time it'll be normal
24:27
to operate just like that that your soul
24:30
will continue to prosper every day
24:33
that it will not be filled with doom and
24:34
gloom with violence
24:36
with anger with offense all those things
24:39
come from the enemy
24:40
and the less you have them the more
24:44
terrified hell is of you
24:46
and the more blessed god is in heaven
24:49
so in my life i love to bless the lord i
24:53
love to bless the father and i love to
24:55
bless the holy spirit
24:56
i greet them every morning when i wake
24:58
up that's the first thing i
25:00
say and then i kiss my husband goodbye
25:02
so he can go fishing
25:06
and he goes fishing and spends time with
25:08
god that's how he spends his time with
25:09
him
25:10
i mean if it's 14 15 hours and
25:13
smell like bait when he comes home
25:17
not my favorite thing
25:20
but really you can have as much of them
25:22
as you want
25:24
as much as you will choose to pursue
25:26
them and we get so
25:28
busy in this world just trying to live
25:32
sometimes we forget them unless we
25:34
really need something and it's okay
25:36
to ask for help and you need help but
25:39
the whole purpose
25:40
for us to have the host of heaven the
25:42
armies of heaven
25:44
at our personal disposal to use
25:48
is so you won't be running to them all
25:50
the time asking them to rescue you
25:53
to keep you safe because we have that
25:56
ability because of christ
25:58
to do that ourself because we're going
26:02
to a new level we can't live the same
26:04
place we were before you can't
26:06
we go from glory to glory that means
26:08
you're going to a higher level
26:11
of knowing them a higher level of
26:13
dominion and authority a higher level
26:15
of prosperity a higher level of the
26:18
glory
26:19
that is an upward movement that means
26:21
you can't stay here
26:23
we can't be down here anymore being
26:24
crushed by the enemy
26:27
he is under our feet
26:29
[Applause]
26:32
i'm gonna make doormats and say hell is
26:34
our doormat
26:38
that's the way we need to think if we
26:41
always walk around
26:42
filled with fear or confusion
26:45
or anger then we can't go to those
26:48
levels
26:50
so that's why god is sending some of the
26:52
greatest revelation
26:53
this is my introduction i'm going to
26:54
talk about america but this is the holy
26:56
spirit's introduction i'll just say that
26:58
the holy spirit always has an
26:59
introduction
27:01
because there's always new people who
27:03
how many people this first time you've
27:04
ever heard
27:04
me anybody bless them jesus
27:08
just take your natural mind and set it
27:10
on a shelf you'll be fine
27:13
because i talk about spiritual things
27:16
now i walk in the spirit amen
27:20
so i don't walk in the flesh
27:23
i don't have personal opinions
27:26
i have their revelation
27:29
and i live by it i can't tell you these
27:32
things if i have not
27:35
lived them myself and it does make a
27:38
difference but what i'm sharing
27:40
to you is a lifestyle
27:43
it's not a cafeteria
27:46
if you can live on earth like they do in
27:49
heaven
27:50
that means you'll have to make some
27:51
changes in your life
27:55
you walk in the spirit what does that
27:56
mean that's a place
27:58
it's a place by the way new revelation
28:02
john was in the spirit why did he say
28:06
that
28:08
why did that why didn't even get put in
28:09
the bible why was that in the bible
28:12
they could have just said he heard and
28:13
was caught up that's not how it starts
28:16
he was in the spirit it was the way he
28:19
lived
28:20
how he processed god the way he
28:22
responded to everything
28:25
he lived a spiritual life that doesn't
28:28
mean
28:28
you walk around so you know so serious
28:32
and sour
28:33
and that's not even what holy is holy is
28:36
absent of sin
28:39
it's an absence of sin that's not hard
28:43
amen so john lived
28:46
this way that he would hear the voice of
28:48
the lord he always obeyed
28:49
he was always willing to do what he
28:51
wanted and he kept him on this earth
28:54
he could still be here if he wanted to
28:57
but he missed
28:59
heaven remember he went there
29:04
you never forget it when he was caught
29:07
up so he was
29:07
in that that place in his heart he was
29:10
in the spirit
29:11
on the lord's day and when they because
29:14
they said that
29:15
i don't think he was even on the isle of
29:18
patmos
29:20
that was supposed to be his prison they
29:22
put him there
29:24
because they were so afraid of him they
29:27
couldn't kill him
29:29
they tried more than three times they
29:31
tried to kill him all the time
29:32
it never worked
29:36
it never worked because this was what
29:39
god was doing
29:40
with him he was allowing him to stay
29:41
here as long as he wanted
29:43
he would fill him with things all the
29:45
time
29:47
so he was already sharing and doing what
29:49
god had told him
29:50
and i'm sure what jesus taught him he
29:53
would go in the spirit
29:54
in the spirit realm and he would appear
29:55
before the sanhedrin
29:58
when he felt like it even after he was
30:02
sent to the alabamas they didn't want
30:03
him to talk to people
30:05
they didn't want him around people he
30:06
was way too weird they couldn't kill
30:08
this guy
30:09
you know what are we going to do we need
30:11
to put him somewhere so we're safe
30:15
he couldn't make you know any
30:16
interruption or disruption
30:18
which happened every time he would
30:19
appear somewhere he already had that
30:22
revelation of going in the spirit
30:24
and so he was in the spirit on the
30:26
lord's day
30:27
and that door open he heard that voice
30:29
he recognized that voice
30:31
and then he was taken up and saw heaven
30:34
saw god the father sitting on the throne
30:36
with the rainbow around him
30:39
he saw him
30:42
[Laughter]
30:45
and so he was showing him he saw the
30:47
very person that he would say
30:48
in the book of john you cannot see the
30:50
face of god and live
30:51
and yet in the book of revelation he saw
30:53
him and saw the face of god and lived
30:56
because this was about a new
30:57
relationship when you receive jesus
31:00
christ
31:01
you can see the face of god and live
31:05
you can see it you're not going to be
31:07
any different when you go to heaven
31:09
if you have christ in you then you're
31:11
righteous
31:13
you have entrance into heaven not just
31:16
when you die
31:20
sometimes god will catch people up even
31:22
even unsaved people
31:23
just so they can have an encounter and
31:25
they freak out they come back and then
31:27
they want to receive
31:28
jesus christ that's happening a lot too
31:31
he's not just
31:32
catching up believers and so you can
31:35
have an encounter
31:36
with the living god with jesus christ
31:39
the holy spirit a lot of us have already
31:40
had
31:41
he's definitely strange
31:44
he loves drama in case you wonder why we
31:47
have drama when we receive the holy
31:49
spirit there's a lot of drama
31:51
i love a story that was told a long time
31:53
ago i think it was probably back in the
31:54
50s
31:55
40s and this church was experiencing
32:00
the holy spirit just moving on everybody
32:02
but their pianist
32:03
was the most proper person in the church
32:07
and she wore white every sunday to show
32:09
how holy she was
32:11
and she sit there and play the most
32:13
common alcohol tunes on her organ
32:17
and she was never moved or touched and
32:19
everybody was like falling out there
32:21
rolling on the floor they were speaking
32:22
in tongues you know and she thinks i'm
32:24
just going to remain rapper
32:26
until one sunday church was passed
32:30
they all wanted to come and see what was
32:31
going on and the holy spirit just
32:33
totally invaded her
32:37
she jumped off of the off of the
32:40
bench and did flips she
32:43
hit the pipe of the wood stove
32:48
sit like a cloud came over her
32:51
it covered her white outfit all the way
32:53
to her feet
32:55
stuck in her hair it got on her face she
32:57
went up and down the aisle just yelling
32:59
in tongues back and forth did not care
33:02
at all so there was drama
33:06
in that church that day that's right
33:08
this is a true story and she never was
33:10
the same
33:11
after that she loved everybody
33:14
she's saying she's singing tongues
33:16
sometimes you know
33:17
and so let me tell you you can try to
33:19
avoid it all you want to
33:22
but they're going to come a day when the
33:24
spirit of god would touch all flesh
33:27
amen without permission
33:32
in the last days i will pour out my
33:34
spirit on what
33:39
and people who never prophesied before
33:42
never had visions before never dreamed
33:43
they're going to do it
33:44
that's right it could be people walking
33:46
out of walmart get hit by the holy
33:48
spirit this is the picture you need to
33:50
have not just everybody sitting in a
33:51
church and
33:52
happening it's going to happen in the
33:53
streets in the restaurants in the
33:55
grocery store
33:56
you know the holy spirit's not going to
33:57
go oh i should wait until they come out
34:02
now he's the most excited being in all
34:04
existence right now
34:07
the greatest show on earth
34:11
will be when the spirit of god is loose
34:13
on all
34:15
[Applause]
34:18
and people who know flesh a believer
34:20
they'll all be beating your door down
34:23
calling you on the phone what just
34:24
happened to me what happened what
34:25
happened what happened
34:27
i can't stop shaking i'm crying i'm
34:28
laughing
34:31
i need to know who jesus is i know you
34:32
know him yes
34:37
it's going to happen it hasn't happened
34:40
yet
34:40
the baptism in fire is going to come
34:43
right after that
34:45
that is a separate baptism yes it's the
34:48
fire that comes from god the father
34:50
himself it will not be very long away
34:55
i don't have dates for everything but i
34:57
can tell you this just because of what's
34:59
already happening
35:01
in the world and there's signs that you
35:04
will see signs that things are changing
35:06
and it's not going to be the same well
35:08
the very trump got elected was a sign
35:12
okay something new is happening god's
35:14
actually going to do exactly what he
35:16
wants no matter what the whole world is
35:17
saying
35:19
no matter what comes up against him it's
35:20
just not going to make any difference
35:22
because
35:22
you're fighting god and all those
35:25
democrats
35:26
were fighting god about kavanaugh
35:30
because god was on his side he
35:33
wants change in the justice department
35:44
so god has a lot of things that that are
35:46
just starting on the earth for the first
35:48
time
35:49
yeah and we get to do that yes he's not
35:52
just going to do everything himself
35:53
he wants you to do them
35:56
now you probably thought your whole life
35:58
you're going to sit on a seat and go
35:59
home and have a good sunday dinner and
36:02
watch football or you know go play with
36:05
your kids or whatever you do
36:06
and then i'll go back next sunday
36:10
your life won't be like that anymore
36:13
you won't it'll be a lot more exciting
36:16
it'll be powerful there'll be many
36:18
things required of you
36:19
and in order for you to carry the glory
36:23
the absolute power of the living god
36:26
yes to when you walk into places things
36:29
are shifted
36:31
like hundreds and thousands of people
36:34
like land where nothing grew before
36:36
produce will come up you go out and stop
36:38
the earthquakes and then they can put it
36:40
back
36:41
you raise the dead that will cremate it
36:43
yes these are greater works
36:46
see all these are things that are
36:47
mentioned in the bible but i think some
36:49
pastors forget them because
36:51
a lot of them are just talking about
36:52
escaping
36:54
and that's not what's going to happen
36:57
that's why the holy spirit told me
36:59
to make things that said roll up your
37:01
rapture rug
37:04
remember the first time you said okay
37:06
you're going to the church are you going
37:07
to say tell everybody roll up the raptor
37:08
rugged one
37:09
okay
37:13
roll up your rapture rug he said i
37:15
didn't tell you to occupy that
37:20
that's not money man jesus said occupy
37:22
until i come
37:24
that doesn't mean go sit somewhere in
37:26
the woods with the raccoons
37:29
and the sea rations and it doesn't mean
37:31
sitting under wraps or rugging your corn
37:33
or not doing ever doing anything but
37:34
waiting to get out of this awful place
37:36
he expects us to change it
37:40
with the power of god revelation
37:44
us surrendering our life
37:47
you know when you get saved when you get
37:48
born again the light of god is put in
37:51
you
37:51
your name is written in this massive
37:53
book in heaven the book of
37:55
life the angels always record it when
37:59
people get born again
38:00
they're always recording it as evidence
38:03
they take it to heaven they don't have
38:05
to but they want to
38:06
god takes a stone of fire from himself
38:08
and puts it in your
38:10
spirit man and that's when you have
38:12
light
38:14
that's where the light comes from jesus
38:16
takes a portion of his anointing a
38:18
measure of the anointing
38:19
walking on the earth and he deposits it
38:22
in you
38:24
that's in first down 227 if you wonder
38:27
where that is
38:29
so you get something you get deposits
38:31
and things put in you
38:32
to make you supernatural and then it
38:35
gives you revelation
38:37
especially when there's a new time we
38:40
have new ways
38:41
we have understanding of our weapons if
38:43
we have been using them
38:45
that armor of god he told you to put on
38:47
it is powerful
38:49
if you're going into a strange place
38:51
where you know people use like really
38:52
bad language or stuff going on
38:54
before you go in that door you need to
38:56
lift up my shield of faith it will block
38:58
and quench
38:58
every fiery dart of the enemy those are
39:01
words propane words
39:03
like people screaming yelling hating it
39:05
won't penetrate you
39:07
that's what that shield does
39:10
all of those parts of your armor are
39:12
important but when you have revelation
39:13
they're even more powerful and now he's
39:17
adding on top of that
39:19
the the destiny of the army of heaven
39:22
to operate as our weapon and we command
39:26
them
39:27
because god himself said command he me
39:31
he didn't say tell me what to do what he
39:33
was saying was you say
39:35
what is going to happen if we are kings
39:39
and priests we have authority
39:41
we have a voice to speak we have a voice
39:44
to speak into the atmosphere
39:46
into the spirit realm against any evil
39:49
no matter where it is we have power over
39:51
all the power of the enemy
39:53
he gave us powerful weapons his word is
39:55
powerful
39:56
his name the demons hate his name
40:01
they remember who he was and he wasted
40:03
hell on the third day and noted the
40:05
faces of the
40:06
principalities and powers
40:10
and they can't change it they can't fix
40:13
themselves
40:14
when something happens from a born-again
40:18
powerful believer filled with jesus
40:21
christ
40:22
you are dangerous that and i know you i
40:25
talk a lot about the authority because
40:26
the body needs to know they have it
40:28
yes and i could talk about all the love
40:30
of god and i did that for years
40:32
how much you love them he believes your
40:34
father you know he wants he wants you to
40:36
know his mercy and his goodness and he
40:38
does
40:39
he wants you to be blessed beyond
40:40
measure and he does but he wants to know
40:43
the other part of it
40:47
jesus is a warrior he's a king right now
40:52
i don't picture him as a little a
40:54
shepherd holding a little lamb in his
40:55
arms anymore
40:57
i see him with those crowns on his head
41:00
and his flings of fire and
41:02
that sword that comes unless you divide
41:04
things asunder
41:05
i see him that way he is my king
41:09
he is the king of spiritual kings
41:14
we are the spiritual kings
41:20
[Music]
41:23
so this is a new lifestyle for you
41:26
what i share with you is not just one
41:29
little thing that's going to help you or
41:30
another little thing
41:31
if you live without revelation
41:35
it's a lifestyle i mean the host of
41:38
heaven
41:39
hearken unto the voice of the lord and
41:42
he's in
41:43
us when we speak and give them commands
41:45
to go do things put on strongholds of
41:47
darkness crush
41:48
it push it back they do it because they
41:50
recognize
41:52
that voice in us but if you as a
41:54
believer are playing in sin
41:57
you may as well put an ego target on you
41:58
you're going to get tapped that's right
42:01
you can't go forward in the kingdom
42:04
that's right
42:05
and then you step back by playing or
42:09
partnering with help you're stepping
42:10
back
42:11
you see that you're stepping back and
42:14
you're flashing into the way you were
42:15
before
42:16
and you're partnering with the enemy
42:18
well that means man they were beating me
42:20
up now i'm coming after them
42:21
yes that's right someone actually asked
42:23
a question
42:25
at our table why do i get attacked a lot
42:26
i feel like they got a big target on me
42:29
well i i didn't answer that question but
42:31
my first thing was how have you been
42:32
living
42:34
have you been treating people what have
42:37
you been saying
42:38
what's in your layers good
42:41
because you have to be filled with the
42:43
light like we we are
42:45
the kingdom of light we are against the
42:48
kingdom of darkness
42:50
so if you get sucked into that kingdom
42:52
of darkness that means
42:54
you stepped back and you are not fit for
42:58
the kingdom is that what that scripture
42:59
says
43:00
if you go forward in the kingdom don't
43:03
step
43:04
back or you will not be fit for the
43:06
kingdom it's like an
43:07
athlete who's practicing for the
43:09
olympics for like 10 years they've been
43:11
doing they finally get their time
43:13
three months away and they decide i'm
43:15
just going to stop all this i'm tired of
43:17
practicing
43:18
i don't want to practice i don't want to
43:19
do this i'm tired i'm taking a break
43:22
do you think they would win in the
43:23
olympics they wouldn't be any use to
43:26
themselves
43:27
or their team they would not be fit
43:30
to compete that's what he means when he
43:33
says you will not be
43:34
fit for the kingdom because your level
43:36
of authority went down
43:38
when you gave it away to the enemy
43:42
that's that's not god doing that that's
43:44
your choice
43:46
with your will amen
43:50
so don't step back if you go forward
43:52
with this you got to keep going forward
43:54
heaven is a forward motion it's not a
43:57
back and forth
43:58
i'm going here and i'm going to go back
44:00
and i'm going here
44:01
oh no i got to go back and he'll forgive
44:04
you for all of it
44:05
to forgive you always
44:08
but he can't put you back up here
44:12
if you were there and you step back
44:15
either by going into sin or by hating
44:17
people
44:18
and bashing and crushing them all the
44:20
time
44:21
that's not heaven's words you're not
44:23
giving life
44:24
it says choose life or death you're
44:26
giving death
44:28
so that means you're stepping back then
44:29
the place you were in going forward in
44:31
the light
44:32
you're making conquest sending the host
44:34
to put on strongholds
44:35
mess up the isis
44:39
they get messed up you can't go
44:42
forward and and the host will listen to
44:45
you
44:46
as long as you're going forward in the
44:47
light and there's not darkness in you
44:50
because they can't partner with darkness
44:53
they were sent by the lord they are a
44:56
weapon
44:56
a mighty weapon to the pulling down of
44:59
strongholds
45:00
we don't fight the enemy we're already
45:04
conquerors
45:06
that as kings and priests and the
45:07
kingdom we do have an army
45:10
amen it's the nose no difference in our
45:14
own military if we had great generals
45:16
and they were getting all these troops
45:17
to go forward making conquest
45:18
taking land taking territory and they
45:21
decided to go partner with the very
45:22
enemy they're fighting
45:24
and they give out secret information and
45:27
tell
45:28
for well some of our troops are stuff
45:29
like that do you think
45:31
they are going to be any good to this
45:34
military that they've been taking
45:35
forward
45:41
we have to see it that way that we can
45:44
no longer participate
45:46
with the enemy and do not let
45:49
fear rule you that's right that's right
45:52
one of the reasons
45:53
why our president is so successful
45:57
is he does not have fear in him
46:01
he doesn't have fear he's made major
46:04
plans
46:05
everything within his being wants to see
46:07
those plans happen
46:08
he really loves his country and he
46:11
really loves the people
46:14
and just because people have twisted and
46:16
lied about but he doesn't care what
46:18
they're saying he's not wasting his time
46:21
he's not running back trying to pull out
46:22
stuff no no no no he is going forward
46:25
which terrifies the enemy and we should
46:29
have an example we have jesus christ for
46:32
example but our very president should be
46:34
an example to all of us
46:35
if you want to achieve the destiny and
46:38
the goal you have in your life
46:40
you can't let everybody here or here
46:42
pull you back
46:43
drag you off the path get you caught
46:45
into other things you have to stay
46:46
focused
46:47
amen and have fun while you're doing it
46:50
that's right
46:51
man so today the victory that happened
46:55
in our country
46:57
and this is what that victory meant all
46:59
of heaven is celebrating kavanaugh
47:02
being put on the supreme court this is
47:04
why they're celebrating
47:07
and i'm sitting there god says pouring
47:09
this all stuff into me
47:10
and i watched it when they confirmed him
47:13
and i kept telling people i don't care
47:14
what they're saying i don't have time to
47:16
listen to the other side
47:18
i don't i know that god has positioned
47:21
this country
47:22
for greatness for blessings for justice
47:27
which is written on one of the steps of
47:28
his very throne
47:31
the word justice is there this is our
47:34
season and time for justice
47:37
especially as believers but also for our
47:40
country this
47:40
is a time of justice liberty
47:44
and freedom and that's what
47:48
he stood for that's what kavanaugh stood
47:50
for
47:51
and so they found someone to pay them to
47:54
lie
47:56
with not one shred of evidence no
48:00
evidence
48:04
even his own children did not believe
48:07
the lies about him
48:09
they lived with him they knew his
48:11
character they knew that he loved god
48:14
and god picked him like he put trump and
48:16
he kept telling me i don't care what
48:17
they say he is sitting on the supreme
48:19
court
48:19
he's going to wipe out rogue versus way
48:21
he's going to give life to baby
48:26
and when i'm sitting there today in the
48:28
hotel room he kept showing me letting me
48:30
see
48:31
all these millions of babies who have
48:35
been aborted and have
48:36
hearings that are in heaven they sang
48:39
and celebrated
48:44
as they were saying yes he was going to
48:46
sit on the screen
48:47
this is what they knew that life would
48:50
change for all the babies
48:53
in america that no longer
48:56
illegal to take their lives and wipe
48:59
them away like dust
49:00
like they had that and they have
49:04
forgiven all those people there's no
49:06
anger in their little souls they're free
49:08
they forgive
49:09
everybody the people who performed it
49:12
the people who allowed it
49:13
the people who voted for that to be
49:15
legal they forgave every person but
49:17
today
49:18
they had a party in heaven and they
49:21
celebrated the other babies
49:24
being conceived in the womb one day
49:27
we'll never have to fear the life being
49:28
taken
49:30
and they'll get to complete their
49:31
destiny on this earth so there was a big
49:33
party in heaven today
49:36
because of that and then and the father
49:38
began to tell me
49:39
he said yes we now have there is now god
49:43
in the white house
49:46
because he's welcomed and allowed to be
49:48
there and he said
49:49
and now i have permission to be in the
49:52
supreme court
49:53
because of cavanaugh as a believer being
49:56
sit on that vent sitting on the bench of
49:57
the supreme court he said now
49:59
i have the right to speak into the court
50:02
system
50:04
and he said because of that i have
50:06
assigned
50:07
three special ops angels
50:12
see i'll never just tell you something
50:14
you're going to get details
50:17
he has a sign of three powerful angels
50:20
host of the host and they're called
50:22
their names are justice
50:24
liberty and freedom and they are
50:27
assigned to protect and keep
50:29
kavanaugh on his family and they're also
50:31
assigned to help him
50:34
bring justice liberty and freedom to
50:37
this country
50:44
in the supreme court and he said he was
50:48
just the first
50:49
put in there he said there are more to
50:51
follow
50:52
and everyone that's nominated will win
50:54
the nomination he said because i'm
50:56
involved in that amen
51:00
so this is really a time for us to
51:02
celebrate god's hand moving
51:04
again divinely moving
51:08
against all the stuff that was
51:10
manufactured
51:12
paid to happen and as much as possible
51:15
they would spend all their time on the
51:16
fake news
51:17
telling the fake stuff and it didn't
51:20
stop it
51:21
it didn't stop it from happening god
51:23
said and
51:25
again in the midterm elections
51:28
that map will be turned red amen
51:33
okay because i did not invest myself
51:36
in trump and putting him in the office
51:38
only to have halfway through his term
51:40
have everything taken away he said that
51:41
it will not happen
51:46
so there's some prophecy for you
51:50
going to be great you just have to watch
51:53
stop watching jumps
51:56
and a lot of people do not understand
51:58
they think the whole end is here
52:00
we actually had somebody i don't know if
52:02
they message me or commented i don't
52:04
know what they did
52:05
um what the hell they said it to me they
52:07
said that you are absolutely wrong you
52:08
need to stop
52:09
talking about all these good things
52:10
happening because this is the last day
52:14
and there is no time for those things to
52:16
happen
52:19
i want to say maybe not on your clock or
52:21
calendar
52:23
but we're living on god's timeline right
52:25
now amen
52:26
and i said i will not ever stop saying
52:28
these things because
52:29
they will happen yes amen
52:33
god's going to make sure his voice stays
52:36
spoken
52:37
in this world so you know what's going
52:40
to happen amen
52:43
you should hear him that clearly
52:47
if your heart is to pursue him to have
52:50
that
52:50
you're going to have it you can't escape
52:52
having his voice
52:54
you can't he's not a respecter of
52:56
persons we all
52:57
have the ability to prophesy the bible
53:01
say
53:01
all they prophesied does that say that
53:04
yes
53:05
so he said desire the best gifts
53:08
that's a best gift you hear how
53:12
god's voice and then speak it for him
53:14
and let me tell you go
53:15
how do i know he's saying something you
53:16
feel like you're going to explode inside
53:19
yeah it really does happen that way when
53:22
i first started doing that
53:23
it would like begin to burn and then it
53:24
felt like my whole body was going to
53:26
explode and the longer i waited to say
53:28
something and the whole time the holy
53:29
spirit is saying open your mouth open
53:30
your mouth
53:32
i don't know what to say open your mouth
53:35
you gotta open your mouth step up and
53:37
open your mouth
53:39
there were no real lessons about that
53:41
but i just honestly say open your mouth
53:46
and say it to whoever it's for and make
53:48
sure it's supposed to be spoken
53:50
sometimes god shares things with you so
53:52
you can pray
53:53
right so you have to discern is this
53:56
something that i can say in love
53:58
that will help them change or am i
54:01
wanting to do this because my flesh is
54:03
really happy i can bash them
54:06
god doesn't bash he shares he gives
54:09
correction
54:11
and then direction but he does it in
54:13
love
54:14
man so what i have is good news
54:18
i have good news for us good news for
54:20
america and not only that the countries
54:23
he's
54:23
shifting around this world like korea
54:26
and that will be one
54:28
land it will be one country without
54:30
communism or a war
54:34
people are thinking that's just not
54:35
going to happen without a war i went yes
54:37
it
54:37
is it will happen because this is god's
54:40
plan
54:42
and if he can shift the mind
54:45
and the focus of that north america
54:47
north korean president
54:50
then it will happen and while i was in
54:53
korea
54:53
i was there to do eight meetings in 10
54:55
days
54:57
i lost like 15 pounds
55:00
yesterday
55:04
seafood yes
55:09
the brazil nuts were really good
55:13
the pretzels brazil nuts and oranges is
55:15
what i ate for 10 days
55:18
but they were delicious as long as i
55:21
didn't have to eat the tea
55:22
[Laughter]
55:24
and god said i'm going to date him this
55:26
is back before i'm going to bait
55:29
he just called him kim i'm going to bake
55:32
him
55:32
with big business and everybody's going
55:35
to wipe him out and get him off the face
55:36
of the earth
55:38
or else he would do that himself
55:39
actually god said if i wait much longer
55:42
he may blow himself
55:43
up because their stuff doesn't work well
55:48
he didn't want him to blow himself up he
55:50
was not happy with what he's doing
55:52
but guess what his soul was filled with
55:54
that stuff by his own father
55:57
it was filled from the time he's little
55:59
war war war war
56:00
war and so what did he know war he
56:03
didn't know what well
56:05
but that's what he knew so god said i'm
56:07
going to shift his
56:08
heart and focus to big business
56:12
and he will want to do the business when
56:14
he sees it
56:15
so he used the olympics
56:18
as bait here's south korea
56:22
making millions of dollars
56:25
from people all over the world coming
56:29
to see those olympics
56:33
and when the person who sent there to
56:34
check it out came back and said do you
56:35
know what
56:36
there is no fear they don't have fear
56:39
all those people coming to visit and
56:41
they're all applauding and yelling and
56:43
cheering
56:44
and they're spending money and spending
56:45
money and spending money
56:49
but no one's afraid because they're
56:52
happy
56:53
they're celebrating something we don't
56:55
even think about
57:00
i don't think they had a team did they
57:02
anyway
57:03
they weren't thinking in that way
57:05
because the mind of their leader was not
57:07
even considering that would be possible
57:11
he was actually in fear that's why he
57:13
was always wanting a war and wipe out
57:15
people before they got and he was
57:17
living with fear in him and god said i'm
57:19
shifting him
57:20
to consider doing big business and
57:23
that's what his focus is
57:26
he still has a lot of changes i'm not by
57:28
any means saying he is perfect
57:29
but his focus has shifted
57:33
amen and if people don't like it they've
57:35
been around him
57:36
they won't last very long
57:40
because he already has seen evidence
57:42
that you can have a different life
57:45
so don't don't consider don't just
57:47
consider that no one you know all things
57:49
are possible with god
57:50
and that's not the only country he's
57:52
going to do that to
57:54
he's going to shift governments and then
57:57
when he shifts the government
57:58
he will shape the nations
58:02
and doors will open for us to go and
58:04
share the gospel where we never
58:06
could before and it's going to be a long
58:10
window not a short few weeks or months
58:14
there's people that believe what i say
58:16
but there's one thing they don't agree
58:17
with
58:18
they think that the rafters coming in
58:19
about three months but they said that
58:21
six years ago i went just
58:25
no we don't want to discuss that right
58:26
now i'm discussing what is the now time
58:28
of god
58:29
that's the future you can't change it
58:32
you can't make it happen
58:34
you don't know that day so how about if
58:36
we just agree together to do what god
58:37
wants us to do now
58:39
amen amen so one of the focuses on
58:42
heaven is to shift nations
58:44
that is by reaching the leaders of those
58:45
nations or removing that leader
58:48
and putting one in there that will be
58:50
shifted
58:51
so you're going to see a lot of activity
58:53
around this world especially in
58:55
governments
58:56
and some of them may not be the ones you
58:58
expected to do something
59:00
but korea is a good example
59:03
because this i know there's wars and
59:04
rumors of wars there'll be more rumors
59:07
than wars
59:09
and when something like that happens it
59:11
won't be a long one
59:14
because the other side will be dealt
59:15
with swiftly and quickly
59:18
because this is a different time on the
59:20
earth well how can you talk like that
59:23
because it's what god is saying this is
59:25
what he wants
59:26
now we're not living the way we did 50
59:30
years ago or even 20 years ago we're not
59:32
living that way
59:33
we have a whole new way we could live
59:35
called heaven culture
59:38
and there's a way you live that we're
59:39
not automatically
59:41
just going to be showered with little
59:42
fuzzy things and the next day
59:44
everybody's going to live on earth like
59:45
they did in heaven
59:47
we have to be living examples of that
59:50
and people will see our lives we'll be a
59:52
living testimony on this earth
59:55
and you can have a life like they do in
59:57
heaven and what is that like no fear
60:00
no wars no hate no laugh no sickness no
60:03
disease
60:05
excitement joy celebration adventure
60:08
the presence of god everywhere in your
60:10
life
60:12
that's the way they live in heaven
60:14
that's heaven culture
60:16
honor is given to people
60:19
no one is rejected there's no offense
60:22
there's no regrets there's no worry
60:26
about
60:26
regrets in heaven no one's going to be
60:28
feeling feel like that they were crushed
60:30
down because they didn't do right on
60:31
this earth
60:33
you remember your life but you use it to
60:36
the glory of god and what he did and how
60:38
much he loved you
60:39
to make sure you got there amen amen
60:42
so this is this is a whole new time and
60:44
he's not saying
60:46
you can't come if you're in this
60:47
denomination
60:50
if you have to be in this denomination
60:51
too common to be a part of this
60:53
otherwise you just can't come that's not
60:56
from heaven either
60:58
no there's one requirement
61:01
if you receive and believe in your heart
61:05
that jesus christ died for your sins and
61:07
you repent for those sins and he
61:10
washes you inside with a shower of his
61:13
blood and wipes all that away like it
61:15
never happened
61:16
and you are counted righteous and your
61:19
name is written in the lamb's book of
61:20
life
61:22
then your whole focus should change with
61:26
god's focus on you
61:28
because people who are not believers
61:31
cannot do these things
61:33
they do not have power over the part of
61:35
the enemy the host will not listen to
61:37
anyone who is a non-believer they're not
61:39
going to listen to them
61:40
they can see inside of everybody you
61:42
either have light
61:43
or you have gray or you have darkness
61:48
in your soul that's what's there there's
61:49
either light
61:51
darkness or gray you don't want gray
61:55
amen and the enemy because those are
61:59
spiritual beings they see spiritual
62:01
things about you
62:04
now i don't give them any ammunition i'm
62:06
not giving them any ammunition
62:08
i have ammunition i'm going to focus on
62:09
them
62:11
but with all that you get with what god
62:14
has planned for us right now
62:16
you also can have uh your greatest
62:19
desires in your heart yes that are for
62:22
good
62:23
it will be his pleasure to give those to
62:25
you amen
62:27
when you start operating like this when
62:30
you start pursuing heaven culture
62:32
your needs become this is what he
62:34
personally told me
62:35
your knees become his responsibility
62:38
and your desires become his pleasure
62:42
the people living in utter darkness who
62:45
don't know any of this
62:46
they see no hope they don't even think
62:49
they have a future
62:51
that's why it's important for us to be a
62:53
living testimony amen
62:56
and we live in one of the greatest
62:57
countries in this world
63:00
we do another country's focusing on is
63:03
is of course
63:03
israel and i knew something major was
63:06
going to happen in israel god said i'm
63:08
going to bless them every time they get
63:09
attacked
63:10
every time someone threatens to attack
63:13
them i'm going to bless
63:14
israel they're going to walk in favor
63:17
with me
63:19
divine favor with me and i will give
63:21
great friends
63:22
who are jews to americans who know me
63:27
and they will do big business together
63:30
and jews know how to do big business
63:32
trust me
63:34
he said i will bless them above measure
63:37
and it will protect them and it will
63:38
keep them
63:39
they will not be wiped out he said
63:42
america belongs to me
63:44
and now the greatest friends is the the
63:47
one who
63:47
who is over israel the one who's over
63:50
america
63:51
are now great friends together and so
63:54
both blessed both will be greatly
63:56
blessed because of this so you can
63:58
see more blessings coming and for the
64:00
first time in a long
64:02
time because a lot of the warring has
64:05
stopped
64:06
because now of course you know of course
64:08
our embassy's over there
64:11
and israel's embassy has been shifted to
64:13
where it should have always been
64:14
yeah and i mean trump pretty much said
64:17
if you attack them you're attacking us
64:19
we will come after you because he's
64:22
he is serious about being friends with
64:24
his
64:31
not going to give billions of dollars
64:32
away to our enemies
64:34
amen so justice is coming
64:39
to this country to our lives
64:42
and there's a whole atmosphere of
64:44
justice that was actually just shifted
64:46
into our country
64:47
because of the supreme court
64:53
more and more you will see justice for
64:55
believers who get dragged into court
64:58
who have court cases uh and they're
65:00
innocent
65:01
more and more you will hear because in
65:03
the past you'd always hear
65:04
they've either taken it somewhere else
65:06
you're going to retry it they found
65:08
something else
65:08
you actually hear real justice being
65:10
given to them
65:12
amen so this is a real powerful time a
65:16
time to celebrate and to be joyful
65:18
for us and if you have family members
65:20
that don't
65:21
like you know our president just pray
65:24
for them
65:25
and let them love them and let them live
65:26
their life they're still going to
65:28
benefit from all of it anyway
65:29
and i have found this to be true you
65:31
yourself probably can't change their
65:33
mind
65:35
a lot of people wear themself out
65:38
trying to prove to their family members
65:40
that they need jesus
65:43
and it's probably going to be someone
65:44
else in this world that does that not
65:46
you
65:47
pray for them hug them love them let
65:49
them know you love them you're praying
65:51
for them
65:52
but don't get into fights every time you
65:53
come together
65:55
okay make sure you have time for love
65:58
for
65:58
family and you may notice a little bit
66:00
of change in them if they don't think
66:02
every time you come it's going to come
66:03
up
66:04
get in your prayer closet send the host
66:07
of heaven against the demonic trying to
66:08
control their lives
66:10
release the anointing into them that's
66:12
what breaks the yoke of darkness over
66:14
them
66:15
there are things that you can do but
66:17
don't waste your whole life
66:19
that's right you know trying to convince
66:21
somebody
66:22
that doesn't want that you cannot make
66:25
them take it amen
66:27
it has to be a choice i do know that
66:30
major restorations are coming from
66:32
families who've been apart for years
66:35
and you may see a lot of that happening
66:36
this christmas especially
66:39
this christmas god's marking is a time a
66:41
major time for restoration and family
66:43
members to break down those barriers
66:45
between them
66:46
so you can expect to hear about that
66:48
happening or you might have that happen
66:50
yourself
66:51
that god's in that time in in that
66:53
christmas christmas season
66:55
will be a time of great restoration for
66:58
families in this earth so
67:00
and heaven does heaven does like
67:02
christmas by the way
67:04
[Music]
67:05
you wouldn't make christmas town in
67:12
heaven
67:14
if you've never heard the truth about uh
67:18
nicholas and how he lived his life when
67:21
he was on this earth
67:22
you don't really know what he was like
67:24
he was not
67:25
a necessarily the happiest person in the
67:27
world
67:28
he was tough he was hard
67:32
and he did not like anyone who spoke
67:33
against the gospel he would take his
67:35
staff and use it for other purposes
67:37
yes go watch saving christmas
67:43
oh yeah i think um kirk cameron
67:46
kirk cameron made a movie called saving
67:48
christmas everybody should look that up
67:50
and watch it
67:52
you should watch it he tells the true
67:54
story he tells the true story about
67:56
nick or nicholas and how his life was
67:59
back in his day and it is quite humorous
68:02
but it's quite true
68:04
and you see a whole different way to
68:06
explain christmas or celebrate christmas
68:09
but god loves it he loves all the lights
68:12
he likes the gift giving
68:14
he loves the fact that sometimes it is
68:16
the only time
68:18
in someone's life that they forgive yes
68:21
it is sometimes it's the only time of
68:24
the year
68:24
that they actually give money to others
68:27
to help them
68:29
amen it is really it's not something bad
68:32
that link
68:32
everything to some satanic ritual that
68:35
was way back when but i have news for
68:37
you heaven was there
68:38
before all that stuff was here and all
68:40
the enemy did was he takes it he
68:42
copycats it
68:43
and so that it looks like it's all evil
68:45
when he's taking something that's good
68:47
that's from god
68:48
and he hates god so in any way he can
68:51
make something look bad he never makes
68:54
anything look good except sinning
68:57
so a lot of the things that he says that
68:59
everybody thinks now halloween
69:01
that belongs to satan that's right don't
69:04
celebrate it
69:07
for the same reason i would tell you to
69:10
you know get on heaven's side
69:12
look up all right uh all those
69:15
evil practices they show in in the
69:18
halloween it is satan's highest day
69:20
of the year and he wants people to
69:23
celebrate his images
69:25
and and it also brings fear into people
69:28
especially
69:28
children and you do draw things to you
69:32
so you don't want to wear any kind of
69:34
image that belongs to the enemy and i
69:35
don't mind if you don't want me to say
69:37
that anymore you don't want to hear me
69:38
anymore don't listen to it
69:39
but i'm telling you truth because i'm a
69:41
seer and i see the things that follow
69:42
those kids down the street
69:44
when they're wearing like ghoulish
69:45
things or demonic things
69:47
you're saying come on yes because you're
69:50
wearing your image
69:53
that's right amen
69:56
so everybody's listening everybody here
69:59
do not celebrate that day
70:01
and one day we will our company have a
70:04
festival of
70:05
light on that same day and we will
70:08
celebrate heaven on that day
70:11
and we'll celebrate life and joy and
70:13
happiness and goodness
70:15
and uh we are going to make calendars
70:17
and on october 31st
70:19
on that calendar it will say celebrate
70:21
life
70:23
we will not honor even mention the other
70:26
side
70:27
amen and i know my dad will tell us all
70:30
the time don't go out and do that
70:31
well my mom would let us because she was
70:33
never churched or anything and
70:34
my dad would pray and pray and pray that
70:36
we would never be affected by it
70:37
he just had a connection to heaven and
70:39
eventually i saw it
70:41
being you see i'm like okay i could tell
70:43
you dad what i saw
70:45
and after that we wouldn't we wouldn't
70:46
do it anymore we would give stuff out we
70:49
didn't shut our door and shut people out
70:51
we would give them a track with a piece
70:53
of candy when they came to the door
70:55
okay we'd have it wrapped around or is a
70:57
part of it we would give it to them
70:58
they're not gonna throw it away okay
71:00
they'll take it home drive it home take
71:01
it out of their bag
71:02
and it'll be put somewhere but somebody
71:04
might see it
71:10
so we do bless people we bless people we
71:12
know a lot of them don't have a clue
71:14
about that but uh you know i'm always
71:16
going to tell you the truth amen
71:20
celebrate christmas yes give people
71:23
gifts that have helped you throughout
71:25
your life and
71:26
maybe you've never said thank you it
71:28
could be something simple you know i
71:30
don't know the guy in the toll booth
71:31
who has you know has to take your money
71:33
all day long and go over the bridge we
71:35
don't have those anymore in our city
71:36
thank you god
71:40
there was one person who ran for mayor
71:42
nobody ever remembers anything about him
71:44
but one thing
71:45
he got rid of the toe booth
71:49
that was his election promise and he
71:51
actually kept it none of the rest of
71:52
them
71:54
so we remember him so i just want you to
71:57
stay excited about this time and
71:59

72:06
take up the offering
72:08
and uh to be a partner with us and what
72:11

72:15
earth
72:16
when you help uh partner with us and you
72:18
give to us
72:19
and you're blessing heaven at the same
72:20
time because this is heaven's plan
72:23
i did not sit in my room one day and
72:26
come up with all this
72:28
that was not on my list
72:31
my list was i will be in big business
72:33
one day
72:34
and i will have a nice loft apartment
72:36
somewhere and it will only be me
72:38
father son and holy spirit with a
72:40
wonderful life
72:42
that was my plan i only got one part of
72:46
that plan
72:47
father son and holy spirit with me for
72:49
the rest of my life
72:52
[Laughter]
72:54
they had their own plan and i was push
72:57
whacked
72:58
[Laughter]
73:02
so and the other thing i'm gonna ask
73:04
also is anybody who's watching this
73:07
if you have not given to river rock
73:10
church
73:11
i would not be here sharing these words
73:14
if he had not invited me
73:15
that's right so even if he's met his
73:17
expenses i would like for you to go to
73:19
his site
73:20
and give money to them they have a big
73:23
project ahead of them
73:24
they're going to help people with are
73:25
you kidding is what my dad and all of us
73:28
kids did for most of our lives we took
73:31
food to people
73:32
we took supplies to people we helped
73:34
them move into homes we painted seniors
73:36
homes
73:37
we we have a heart to help
73:41
so that's what i see with all this yeah
73:43
and they didn't ask for it okay this is
73:46
the thing
73:46
they did not ask for this this was god's
73:50
plan
73:51
if you've given yourself to god expect
73:53
the unexpected amen
73:55
this is the unexpected but that is not
73:57
normal
73:59
for major companies to call you up and
74:00
say i have traffic trainer loads
74:02
of stuff to give to you do you want it
74:07
i know people who beat dom the doors of
74:09
those places say can you give some stuff
74:11
to us to help with our project
74:13
they didn't even say that they don't
74:14
even have a place to put it and yet here
74:16
it is
74:17
and it's coming and it's not going to
74:19
stop
74:21
so they need a warehouse and not some
74:23
cheap one
74:24
that they have to spend half a million
74:25
dollars fixing i want them to have a
74:28
wonderful one amen amen so please
74:31
give if you have not given and you're
74:33
watching this
74:34
you need to send some money to pastor
74:36
eric at river rock church
74:37
for this project amen
74:41
and then you have a part of that reward
74:43
no matter where it happens this is how
74:45
god does
74:47
he will give you reward like eric will
74:49
get
74:50
because you're helping him to do this he
74:54
didn't ask me to do this
74:56
god told me to do it he said you're
74:58
going to bless
74:59
my son eric you're going to bless
75:01
riverrot who's invited you time and time
75:03
again no matter how wild you
75:05
are or the things that you say he obeys
75:08
you obey
75:09
i want to help him this is my plan it's
75:11
his plan eric so you're not going to
75:12
escape
75:12
it so people please remember them
75:15
but right now we're going to take up an
75:17
offering uh for me to help me in what i
75:19
do we have a lot of big plans
75:22
weather warriors is gonna be one of them
75:24
he's not gonna let us drop that
75:26
and uh our whole women's thing we have
75:28
will go worldwide
75:30
the wonder women and now we're adding on
75:32
top of that
75:33
something for all the men called the
75:35
dread champions because hell will drive
75:37
you
75:39
if anybody does anything it should be
75:41
held dreading you amen
75:43
you wake up in the morning they start
75:45
getting terrified
75:47
and so we have a lot of things we have
75:49
our wonder woman event coming up
75:51
we have our champions event coming up
75:53
and next year we'll also add to that our
75:55
host initiative
75:56
event and our spirit realm boot camp
76:00
which every member of the body of christ
76:02
needs that so they know what the spirit
76:04
realm is what happens there what
76:06
authority do you have there how do you
76:07
use that authority
76:09
why is it necessary to know about in
76:10
your life because the veil
76:12
between the spirit realm and the natural
76:14
realm is getting
76:15
thinner we we really hope to see an
76:20
angel one day
76:21
one day they'll be everywhere and you
76:22
will see them
76:24
but there will be both sides and the
76:27
other side will try to influence people
76:29
too
76:30
and you'll see them so why not know this
76:33
is going to happen on this earth
76:36
it's going to happen and so you're
76:39
hearing this
76:40
it's going to happen you will see angels
76:42
you'll see them in your home living in
76:43
your hands
76:44
home going back to heaven and forth in
76:45
your home
76:47
they may have some come to the front
76:48
door and knock
76:51
and the other side will be happening
76:53
they'll be trying to make friends with
76:54
people
76:55
and trying to prove that they're good
76:56
too i'm talking about demons
76:58
because so many of the kids games and
77:01
videos
77:02
and movies are actually helping to
77:04
introduce them
77:05
as something that is normal
77:09
and so you have to have a voice that
77:11
tells you this is going to happen
77:13
it's important to know about this and
77:14
people change when they have spirit
77:16
around boot camp
77:17
and they understand that's not just a
77:19
mysterious unseen realm that is a real
77:21
literal round
77:23
where things travel in it there's
77:24
highways in it there's places in it
77:27
there's things that you need to know
77:28
about that's where your real authority
77:30
is
77:31
when you speak and take authority your
77:32
king or uh your king a priest or a lord
77:36
in the spiritual level of authority so
77:39
you have to know what that spiritual
77:40
what that spirit realm is amen
77:43
so make up checks to river rock church
77:46
and then they'll just give me one check
77:48
and i think you
77:49
at the envelopes that are there in front
77:51
of you somewhere i think you can
77:52
give me your card if you want to and
77:56
i will bless all of it in just a few
77:58
minutes i
77:59
i don't like to stop talking because i
78:01
know i only have a little bit of time
78:02
left
78:03
here tonight because we also have what's
78:05
tomorrow
78:07

78:11

78:25

78:29
women's up for a glow
78:31
international what used to be women's
78:34
above
78:35
the seventh of god they've changed it to
78:37
a glow international so the men can come
78:39
too
78:41
and i've i've done a global
78:43
international meetings
78:44
and some people are surprised that the
78:46
assembly god lets me speak
78:51
but when i was growing up that was the
78:53
denomination we went to
78:55
we went there we were faithful we helped
78:57
our our pastor and
78:59
we're on part of his volunteer team and
79:01
we love them
79:02
they helped put a lot of god in us they
79:04
put us on that right road that's where i
79:06
got saved i was in the assembly god
79:08
church
79:08
my dad was a lay minister with them and
79:11
my grandmother was a missionary so we do
79:13
love that denomination
79:15
and they're getting more and more of
79:16
holy spirit in heaven they want the
79:18
supernatural they want to know about
79:19
heaven encounters
79:20
and so monday night we will have another
79:22
meeting here so i'm not done
79:24

79:28
offering
79:29
and uh we're going to let them take it
79:31

79:40
people cry not from the anointing
79:44
not my gift all my kids were fussed in
79:47
the back of the car
79:48
i would sing and they would cry
79:52
and they would repent and they would
79:54
stop
79:56
when they got older it would make me
79:58
sing in the car with their friends when
79:59
they were about 11 or 12.
80:01
they wanted to make them laugh too
80:04
maybe in heaven one day but on the earth
80:08
that's not my gift and i don't dance
80:11
either although i teach
80:12

80:15
tomorrow night

and let me
80:29
and then my daughters looked at me and
80:30
went we don't have to help do we
80:35
because i've been thrown out of
80:36
jazzercise classes
80:37
[Laughter]
80:39

80:41
little step thing you've never been

80:44
doing and they do like step
80:46

80:49
one one two two and they were like on
80:52
step fifteen
80:54
and i'm like one
80:57
two or is it one one two
81:01
and i looked up and everyone in the
81:02
mirror was watching me
81:05
and and i was like down front somewhere
81:09
with my sister who dragged me in there
81:10
not down
81:11
john didn't drag me there and the
81:13
instructor stopped saying okay you back
81:15
there
81:15
you yeah you you
81:19
are going to go to the back of the room
81:20
in the corner
81:23
because you can't keep up and everyone
81:25
is trying to do except now they're
81:27
watching you so would you go back there
81:28
please
81:30
that didn't hurt my feelings
81:33
i told my sister this is not going to
81:35
work so i'm in the in the back in the
81:37
corner i'm still
81:38
doing the same thing you know is this
81:39
one two
81:41
one one two because i have not
81:44
gifted in that either and again the
81:47
music was rocking and people were doing
81:48
nothing
81:49
because then they were trying to look
81:50
behind everybody
81:53
in the mirror to see what i was doing so
81:56
i was asked to leave
82:00
and i was like yes amen i believe
82:08
now that was pretty much the same thing
82:09
that happened to me in eighth grade when
82:10
i tried out for chorus
82:13
i wasn't always bold you know i would go
82:16
for it anyway
82:17
and they so they had the auditions you
82:19
know how that happens
82:20
they let anybody anybody who wants you
82:22
to be in the course just come audition
82:24
so we know where to place you
82:27
and i went and they were singing that
82:28
dough ready me thing
82:31
and i'm halfway through and the people
82:33
are laughing so hard they're crying
82:37
i'm saying the director was crying the
82:39
people there to audition were crying
82:41
and go stop this is the joke isn't
82:44
it and what yes it is
82:55
that was not written on my scroll
82:59
but by speaking wildly and boldly about
83:02
what god wants regardless of what people
83:04
think about you to not
83:06
care when people bash me or whatever
83:08
they try to do
83:09
um i don't know they make yourself a
83:11
target on uh facebook or
83:13
youtube or twitter and whatever that new
83:16
thing is we're gonna be doing
83:18
instagram instagram
83:21
and we're already doing podcasts we're
83:22
going to be doing webinars
83:24
guys it'll put you out a lot more online
83:26
and i just ignore
83:27
everybody out there i do not have time
83:30
to stop
83:31
and justify myself and uh i don't have
83:34
time it's wasting time
83:35
i just start with you know i love you
83:37
but you're banned
83:38
[Laughter]
83:41
we got a lot of banding done during the
83:43
election i mean like a lot of people
83:48
those three nights when god said i'm
83:50
going to tell you all the
83:51
characteristics and the qualities of
83:53
this person i have chosen for president
83:55
and everybody was trying to guess who
83:56
that was and
83:58
and our viewing audience went from like
84:00
it went from like you know
84:01
20 30 000 to 200 000 overnight
84:05
and then 800 000
84:08
because and so on that fourth day when i
84:12
had when god revealed who it was i have
84:14
not chosen
84:15
a pastor for your president i have not
84:17
chosen an apostle
84:19
or i mean i went through the whole five
84:20
whole thing i haven't chosen any of
84:22
those because you don't need them i have
84:23
chosen a businessman
84:25
and this name is donald j and it was
84:28
like
84:29
bash back
84:32
like we were up all night long you know
84:34
trying to get all the bachelors off of
84:36
here
84:37
and i think that what really very quite
84:39
really a whole lot was a very small
84:40
percentage but the rest of them were
84:42
celebrating celebrating celebrating
84:45
and then they went to the voting booth

87:20
we didn't live in
87:21
amen and i'm 66 i'm still young god
87:25
calls me a baby
87:28
you know uh america is a baby he says
87:30
america is a baby amen
87:32
yes we're only a couple hundred years
87:34
old yes when you put us up to england
87:36
and these other countries and see how
87:37
long they've been around
87:39
that israel you know china how long have
87:41
they been here
87:43
we are a baby and saint wants to destroy
87:47
the baby
87:49
he's always afraid of the baby he always
87:52
has been
87:53
well we're a baby but we're going to
87:56
grow up amen
87:58
we're going up strong and happy
88:02
and filled with god and uh there'll
88:04
still be things arise in our country but
88:06
they'll be dealt with swiftly
88:08
there will be no anarchy in the streets
88:10
in our country
88:12
that we know is trying to overthrow each
88:14
other in our country
88:16
which has always been one of the devil's
88:17
plans and he doesn't know what he's
88:18
messing with and this is what god said
88:20
when they kept trying to say there's
88:22
going to be you know anarchy in the
88:23
streets and
88:24
then the international guard will be
88:26
called and take control of everything
88:28
and there's half a million body bags
88:30
waiting in
88:30
uh in missouri for the bodies what
88:33
happened from all this war in the
88:34
streets and
88:36
god's like laughing in heaven he said
88:39
that's not my plan and that is not going
88:41
to happen
88:42
he said besides the fact that they don't
88:44
understand that they aren't ever going
88:46
to get their weapons
88:48
god said they won't ever get their guns
88:50
in america
88:51
there's too many
88:55
he rednecks that there's too many
88:57
rednecks in america they all got guns
88:59
they're not giving any of them up but
89:01
they will use them
89:03
so they can forget about getting their
89:04
guns because it is our right to protect
89:06
ourselves
89:07
in other countries that are like third
89:09
world countries that happened because
89:10
they took away the right to bear arms
89:13
they have no voice in their country they
89:16
have no way to protect themselves in
89:17
their country
89:18
that's why they're crushed down and god
89:21
said leaders who are presidents can be
89:23
great
89:24
leaders in the way if they want good for
89:26
their country and if they want to do
89:27
what is right for the country then their
89:28
country can be great
89:30
he said but dictators if you're a
89:33
dictator
89:34
then you hate what is right most of the
89:37
time
89:38
you only want what you want it has to be
89:41
only your way
89:42
and you crush if you don't get your way
89:46
you take away all the rights of the
89:47
people that way they can be controlled
89:49
they can only operate oh it sounds like
89:51
the market of east
89:52
and then they can only operate the way
89:54
you allow them to operate he said but
89:56
america is not that country
89:58
amen and i will pray for all of us stand
90:01
up and pray for those other countries
90:03
right now
90:04
that are going through shifts in their
90:06
government that they will hear god and
90:09
they will do what is right amen
90:10

90:17

90:23
our father jesus christ
90:27
our king our king holy spirit
90:30
our best friend we stand in the gap
90:35
for all those countries that don't have
90:38
justice liberty or freedom
90:43
we pray on their behalf that you will
90:46
help them
90:48
open the eyes of their leaders
90:51
to see what is right and to go after
90:54
what is right
90:56

there's
00:17
crazy wild things going on out there
00:20

00:22
help
00:23
people to believe because
00:26
actually you know god's revelations are
00:28
for those who will receive
00:30
them not for those who
00:33
bash them so today you will hear
00:36
god's reality and jen is pointing her
00:39
finger at me
00:41
oh hi i'm looking in the wrong place
00:44

01:05
[Laughter]
01:06
we will be addressing that before we're
01:10
done tonight you now this is going to be
01:11
a short broadcast number one
01:14
my husband's waiting to eat and i've
01:16
learned from men
01:18
if the world's falling apart which it's
01:19
not if they're at war in a bunker
01:22
where the missile is flying past them
01:24
that probably doesn't happen that way
01:26
however i will tell you this men have to
01:29
eat
01:30
all you women who are married say amen
01:35
because i have been married for 43 years
01:37
and this is not about my marriage but
01:39
why not bring it into play
01:41
i have learned how to get along with my
01:43
husband and love him
01:45
not want to run him out of town on a
01:46
rail some of you if you're in your 10th
01:49
12th year of marriage you may feel that
01:51
way please hang in there
01:52
okay god brought you that man and you
01:55
know what
01:57
i will address this another guy
02:01
the holy spirit said continue on with
02:03
what you have to say
02:05
and they have asked me to talk about
02:08
god's reality which is
02:09
actually the thing we should want to
02:11
know the most and
02:13
actually his reality is the truth
02:16
a lot of fake news going on everybody
02:18
you've known that for
02:19
months probably years but right now with
02:23
the stuff going on right now in
02:24
washington dc and everything else
02:26
there's a lot of stuff
02:29
being flown out there for you to listen
02:31
to or you to watch
02:33
i hope you find some truth in some of it
02:36
some of it's like so far out there
02:38
is from outer space some of us just on
02:41
wi-fi space
02:43
some of it i'm not quite sure where it's
02:45
from i just know one thing
02:47
i listen to god i hear him well
02:50
i have known him for some time now
02:54
which is his decision to put me
02:57
out there i was always the person that
02:59
wanted to hide because
03:01
i didn't need anybody uh personally
03:04
i had a try therefore i had all the
03:06
validation
03:08
or war that i wanted so right now i can
03:12
persevere and continue on
03:14
i forgive everyone out there please do
03:17
not waste your time trying to explain to
03:19
people who don't want to hear an
03:20
explanation
03:22
or who don't want the truth just pray
03:24
for them and ignore them
03:26
like they said nothing whatsoever
03:27
because that's actually the best thing
03:28
you can do
03:30
and i know because more people are
03:32
watching and listening
03:33
you're always going to get more of the
03:35
side that is
03:37
clueless who hates everybody
03:40
who has their own mindset and doesn't
03:41
want anyone else's
03:44
who are just angry and they want to vent
03:46
on everybody
03:47
right now i happen to be a bull's-eye
03:50
but i'm also a bull's-eye for god
03:53
that part i love so i forgive everybody
03:56
in advance
03:57
god act like they never said it
03:59
especially if it was one of your
04:00
prophets
04:01
jumping off the path off the train or
04:04
out into nowhere
04:06
please forgive them and help them to
04:08
know the truth so they can be free
04:11
they can be powerful for you and not
04:14
a voice for the enemy because right now
04:16
the reality god's reality is
04:18
this is not a doom and gloom time
04:22
this is not a time to be in fear
04:25
to tolerate fear or participate with
04:28
fear it's a time to be great with god
04:32
excited about his plans and please
04:35
pursue
04:36
making plans for your life like you were
04:38
before all this ever happened
04:41
because it will be like it never
04:42
happened and that is god's reality
04:45
he has a moment in time to shift us
04:49
and accelerate us forward but before he
04:51
does that
04:53
he will cleanse the platform expose the
04:57
darkness and boy
04:58
is there a lot of that to expose
05:01
and it doesn't matter what group it's
05:03
being disposed from it will be exposed
05:05
in this time
05:06
and god will also deal with it in this
05:08
time why
05:10
because of all the powerful things he
05:12
has planned for us
05:14
i have been there i have seen it
05:17
it is going to be great your children's
05:20
future is so fantastic
05:22
it will not be filled with fear it will
05:24
not be filled with evil it will not be
05:27
filled with having to run and escape
05:29
somewhere hide under your school desk
05:31
you know that's not what's happening
05:33
right now it's god
05:35
asking us to trust him until his
05:39
time comes to show it all
05:43
and trust me you wonder what time is
05:45
going to happen you will see it
05:47
you'll see the exposure you'll see the
05:49
arrest
05:50
you'll see the fraud he will not let
05:52
anyone escape
05:54
with justice not being brought to them
05:57
justice will be served that's what he
05:59
says so wait for the justice people is
06:02
so worth it
06:04
to love your family spend time with them
06:07
go on as normal as you possibly can
06:10
until it's wiped out disposed of
06:13
put away wiped off and god will set in
06:16
place the ones
06:17
he trusts to speak to you now we have
06:20
several things we want to talk about in
06:22
this broadcast so i'll just give you a
06:23
little
06:24
what is it called an outline an index
06:26
whatever you want to call it
06:28
okay we will discuss the reality of what
06:30
god is doing right now
06:32
we will discuss the earthquakes
06:35
that started the shaking that god said
06:38
on november the
06:39
4th of 2020
06:42
when the ground begins to shake
06:45
wait for the great exposure of fraud
06:48
to begin to happen and when it's done
06:52
it will all be dealt with it will all be
06:55
brought to justice
06:57
i don't need to name any names to let
06:58
you know that this is what he's doing
07:01
so on november the 4th things started
07:04
shaking
07:05
and guess what even up to right now they
07:08
are still shaking
07:09
not just here in america all over the
07:11
world
07:12
some of them cannot even be explained
07:14
why because
07:15
sometimes in the spirit realm what
07:17
they're doing is so
07:19
powerful there's always a little bit of
07:21
that that laps over into this natural
07:24
realm
07:24
and people can feel it sometimes they
07:27
can hear it
07:28
and let me tell you that shaking and the
07:31
winds being released
07:32
that is god moving on this earth
07:36
yes i mean the father moving on the
07:39
earth
07:40
you remember what happened the first
07:41
time he did that the mountains caught on
07:43
fire
07:44
well he wants your souls to catch on
07:47
fire for
07:47
him not in fear
07:51
not thinking you needed to be rescued
07:54
this is god's reality now we've jumped
07:56
to that subject
07:57
god has a reality and his reality is
08:00
this is a powerful exciting time to be
08:03
alive
08:04
he has never changed that some people
08:06
have changed it
08:07
some people are jumping off that train
08:10
right now
08:10
thinking that we're going to be derailed
08:12
and there'll be a crash
08:14
i think the future will take a crash
08:17
because you cannot speak for god
08:18
saying adamantly this is what he has
08:20
said and this is what he's going to do
08:22
and just
08:23
because you don't know the time
08:26
you think it's not gonna happen that is
08:29
an immaturity
08:30
in the prophets of god you need to know
08:34
if he says something to you or showed
08:35
you and said this will happen
08:38
just because it's not a year window of
08:40
time
08:41
or man's window of time it doesn't mean
08:44
it won't happen
08:46
you can't back up you can't stop going
08:50
forward
08:51
the true prophets of god right now are
08:53
speaking
08:54
greatness the power of god the joy of
08:57
the lord
08:58
celebration celebration celebration
09:01
is coming to america that's what his
09:03
true prophets are saying
09:05
if you hear them saying there's doom and
09:06
gloom let's go
09:08
we're going into the deep darkness guess
09:11
who they're listening to
09:13
not god the enemy has a voice too
09:16
and when you accept fear he'll make sure
09:20
satan well make sure you hear his voice
09:23
and then you'll believe it
09:24
and then you run after it and then you
09:26
repeat it does this sound like a cycle
09:29
i can tell you right now god wants you
09:32
to believe
09:32
him and trust him satan
09:36
does not hold your life in his hand that
09:39
doesn't happen to the very end
09:41
and you most likely won't be here unless
09:43
you're several hundred years old
09:45
you are in the greatest days god
09:47
designed to be on the earth
09:50
he's just setting it up i'm sorry it
09:53
didn't happen on the third i'm sorry it
09:55
didn't happen
09:56
so far in january that doesn't mean he's
09:58
not doing it
09:59
no because i do have something
10:03
a lot don't i has a seer anointing
10:08
if you were a prophet and you could see
10:10
into the spirit
10:11
you would right now see demons quaking
10:14
in fear sliming their way
10:18
to get out of the way because
10:21
they know and they can see god
10:25
is walking across this nation
10:28
they're terrified now because they know
10:30
their plans are going up in smoke
10:32
literally they're running away as fast
10:35
as they can so they don't get
10:37
burnt by the fire of god and let me tell
10:40
you
10:40
your prayers are so powerful when you
10:42
stand with god and you make declarations
10:45
it begins to release something in the
10:47
spirit realm that does
10:48
cause fear and the camp of the enemy
10:52
the enemy is not man the
10:55
enemy is satan he just uses man
10:58
he uses him for his own purposes to
11:00
speak his words
11:01
to say what his plans are his plans are
11:04
never good
11:06
and they don't bring hope or joy to
11:08
anybody
11:10
so don't listen to anyone
11:13
who's speaking in doom and gloom
11:17
and hate and cowering
11:21
and having to put up with a horrible
11:23
future
11:25
maybe they want that future i don't
11:29
the moral majority in this country don't
11:31
want that future
11:32
the true body of christ who are all
11:35
knowing that god is going to move his
11:38
hand
11:39
when he is ready whether it is
11:44
tomorrow or not
11:47
you may hold your finger out and say
11:48
you're fake news
11:51
you're a fake leader we don't receive
11:53
you
11:54
we don't celebrate what you've said
11:56
because fraud has been committed
11:58
not sure that facebook will let me keep
12:00
this one up make sure you're taping it
12:03
make sure you make a copy of it and keep
12:04
it all right
12:06
and i'm telling you anything you want to
12:08
keep that's been said and spoken
12:10
or written make a paper copy
12:14
go find your printer if you didn't
12:16
forget what that was
12:17
print it so you may hold it in the time
12:21
i had
12:22
should you for a few weeks need to do
12:24
that
12:25
if not i hope you're taking notes
12:27
because i will tell you this
12:29
everything god has spoken that god
12:32
himself has spoken
12:33
it will happen and it will be great
12:38
and there will be celebration in the
12:40
streets
12:41
so the reality of god is make your stand
12:46
and don't be moved and while you're
12:48
waiting
12:49
celebrate why does god say celebrate
12:52
that
12:52
shows the enemy and your friends
12:56
that you're standing in faith your faith
12:58

13:00
it will be accelerated and guess what
13:02
all your friends and family that made
13:03
fun of you
13:04

14:21
are powerful teach your children to
14:23
celebrate
14:24
what jesus christ did for them and what
14:26
his plans are
14:27
for right now on this earth this is not
14:31
a joke
14:32
this is not a recording i'm live see
14:35
here i'll pinch myself
14:37
this is a real life this is god's
14:39
reality
14:41
all the rest of it is a smoke screen by
14:44
satan
14:45
wanting to try to convince us that we're
14:47
going down
14:48
life is going down the country's going
14:50
down
14:51
that's awfully funny i remember the last
14:54
time
14:55
god showed up when satan thought he won
14:59
he got burnt i can expect
15:02
to see the same i've seen demons
15:05
slinking
15:06
away from everything running from dc
15:10
as fast as they can you know what that
15:12
means
15:13
if the enemy's power is left great
15:16
confusion will begin to fall on the
15:17
others
15:19
get ready for a real show that's all i
15:22
can say
15:24
remember whose life
15:27
you are in their hands right
15:31
that life is yours the decision is yours
15:34
the word should be yours that you agree
15:37
with life and not death
15:40
god says to choose life and to speak
15:42
life whatever is a good report sir
15:45
remind you of the word those words you
15:47
declare
15:48
so if you hear things that aren't a good
15:50
report we know where that came from
15:52
no matter who is saying them pray for
15:54
those people
15:56
do not bash those people man if they
15:58
ever needed help it would be right now
16:00
i don't care how major a prophet it is
16:03
who all of a sudden
16:04
overnight has decided the bad stuff is
16:07
going to happen
16:08
because guess what they're looking with
16:10
their natural eyes and when god says
16:13
they begin to do that this is what they
16:15
see they can see
16:17
as far as their hand and that's it
16:20
but when you stay focused on god keep
16:22
your eyes on him
16:24
stay excited don't step back on the word
16:28
and you will be accelerated
16:32
and you will be prospered and you will
16:34
be blessed and you will have the
16:35
greatest
16:36
memories that you can tell your children
16:39
and your grandchildren you will not
16:41
believe what happened
16:43
in this beginning of this divine decade
16:45
boy
16:46
we had to make a stand so remember to
16:49
celebrate and i will show you the cake
16:50
in just a minute jen is waving me down
16:53
keep us on track jen whatever whatever
16:56
are we supposed to talk about
16:58
um well you wanted to mention the
17:02
earthquakes yes november the 4th was
17:05
when god
17:06
actually began to talk about what would
17:07
happen and i can go back on the elijah
17:10
list
17:11
and re-share the november 4th
17:15
uh facebook live with you and steve yeah
17:17
so everyone can hear when you said that
17:19
oh yeah that actual uh broadcast was so
17:22
powerful
17:22
and really neither one of us probably
17:24
knew what god would say
17:26
he just knew he wanted to speak after
17:28
november the 3rd which of course we know
17:30
was election day
17:32
god knew exactly what would happen so it
17:34
is very powerful that god
17:36
since november the 4th what he said
17:39
would happen
17:40
has been happening you just haven't seen
17:43
and heard it but trust me
17:44
you will but on november the 4th that
17:47
day
17:48
when he said when the ground begins to
17:50
shake
17:51
look for the beginning of the landslide
17:54
a fraud
17:55
what happened on november the 4th john
17:57
well there was
17:58
a earthquake in yosemite valley
18:02
california there you go that's the usa
18:05
and um the thing that we thought was
18:07
also
18:08
amazing was the day of the
18:11
election yes because remember they they
18:14
they stopped counting
18:16
they stopped counting at midnight or 1am
18:18
something like that and then there was
18:20
a earthquake around 2 58 i'm trying to
18:23
remember where it was
18:24
in the morning yeah in the morning that
18:26
would have been eight pm
18:28
that would have been the fourth probably
18:30
when stuff was going
18:31
earthquake i think it was was it alaska
18:33
falls pass
18:35
alaska of all names false past
18:39
alaska are you kidding is that crazy i
18:42
think god was saying something yeah and
18:44
then of course
18:44
we all know they mysteriously got all
18:48
those
18:49
votes that came in at 3am yes hey
18:52
that's just a few minutes after 2 52 a.m
18:56
not only that there was a second
18:57
earthquake in alaska at 5 35
19:00
p.m so all those hours going by
19:03
we're going to find out about all that
19:05
really soon but where else in the world
19:07
on november 4th were the earthquakes
19:09
there was one in canada
19:11
there was the philippines greece turkey
19:14
actually many one yeah there was a lot
19:17
have they stopped since then
19:18
no not at all but not just the
19:22
earthquakes there's been mysteriously
19:25
mysterious ground shakings everywhere
19:28
that's
19:28
not reported that's right they don't
19:30
know where it's come from
19:32
and also there's been activities a host
19:34
of heaven people
19:35
unusual gust of winds that have come out
19:38
of nowhere
19:39
yes that were not natural right they
19:42
weren't like a natural wind
19:44
i'm telling you god why would god say
19:47
that about the shaking
19:48
it's to encourage you and let you know
19:52
he is doing things that you cannot see
19:55
right now
19:56
but everything that is seen this is what
19:59
the word says everything this scene was
20:01
made by that which was
20:02
unseen the unseen is the spirit realm it
20:05
is a father son
20:06
and holy spirit's activities and there
20:09
is a lot of that going on
20:10
they are driving things out moving
20:14
things into position
20:15
that they will need their place there
20:17
for what is going to happen
20:19
this week will be key i'm not saying
20:22
tomorrow
20:23
i'm not promising anything tomorrow
20:25
except god won't stop moving and doing
20:27
things
20:28
until all of this is shown and you will
20:31
see
20:31
it with your natural eyes and hear it
20:34
with your ears
20:35
and then there'll be the great
20:36
celebration your job
20:39
is to stay in faith stand and stand
20:42
therefore but don't stand
20:43
looking sorry and sad and fearful
20:46
remember please to pray for all those
20:48
who are
20:49
backing up apologizing for things they
20:52
said there's nothing to apologize for
20:54
people
20:55
the truth will be made known and no one
20:59
will escape
21:00
knowing about it no one will escape
21:02
being uncovered that did it
21:05
so pray for those who've jumped off the
21:08
train
21:09
and backed up and god pray
21:12
that they be reached that they know the
21:14
truth and tell the truth
21:16
to not get people to fear don't let
21:19
people put fear in you
21:21
then the enemy has something in you he
21:23
can use
21:24
it won't stop god from what he's going
21:26
to do but why not enjoy
21:29
every day of your life let god says you
21:31
choose to be happy
21:32
if no one else does heaven is happy
21:36
heaven is excited we thought we would
21:38
drink bring these up because we've had a
21:40
lot of questions
21:42
the last broadcast we did has already
21:44
reached a hundred and forty two thousand
21:46
people what
21:47
they want to hear somebody who's hearing
21:50
god
21:50
and gives them hope god always brings
21:54
hope
21:55
so are you saying that even if
21:58
a certain someone is sworn in on the
22:01
20th yes
22:02
i think and we all wake up on the 21st
22:06
yes and he still thinks he's in that
22:09
position
22:10
it means we should still stand strong
22:12
stand strong and know this
22:14
until it's all revealed it
22:18
isn't over that's right
22:21
god has the final say and when he says
22:25
it and when it is all
22:27
done somebody will be moving back in the
22:30
white house
22:32
and guess what they know it too
22:36
there's no fear in the lives of those
22:39
who just moved out
22:40
they already know that they will be back
22:44
so just remember covert activities hey
22:47
guys
22:48
just be thankful god didn't ask us to
22:50
wait 120 years
22:52
like he did with noah he's just wanting
22:55
us to wait a little while
22:57
so keep holding on
23:00
it's gonna happen the rain is coming he
23:02
keeps telling me the rain is coming
23:04
the rain is the evidence but this time
23:07
it's the enemy's camp that's going to be
23:09
flooded
23:10
and destroyed that's right and we are
23:13
not for violence of any kind well
23:16
maybe spiritual violence did you know
23:18
there's a godly violence
23:20
a spiritual violence that you wore in
23:22
the spirit against satan against the
23:24
demonic armies
23:26
that is certainly okay we don't want to
23:29
have violence against people although
23:32
the group that says they don't want it
23:33
seem to be doing it
23:35
you already know what i'm talking about
23:36
right god didn't intend us to have to
23:39
put up or tolerate
23:41
violence not in this country not in our
23:44
lives
23:45
actually not for those who believe him
23:47
in this day
23:49
you won't have to die to show who god is
23:53
but you will have to live and live
23:57
powerfully and rule and reign with
23:59
christ
24:00
in this world right now and he
24:03
is not afraid was there anything else we
24:06
were going to talk about jenna
24:08
oh yes the holy spirit just reminded me
24:11
guess what i still have lights on
24:13
outside
24:14
if at all possible go put some lights
24:17
back
24:18
up maybe you haven't taken them down the
24:20
light
24:22
represents god so let's leave some light
24:25
up
24:26
until the real inauguration happens
24:29
maybe leave up the red lights
24:31
red and white lights very white would be
24:33
great
24:34
that would be great but if you only got
24:36
white we'll take that
24:38
we're leaving ours up i hope you leave
24:40
yours up i hope they're seeing
24:41
everywhere and people go blows up we
24:44
have hope for a future we are trusting
24:46
our god
24:48
our god is light
24:51
why not put something up outside or in
24:54
your window
24:55
that represents god
24:58
that's who our savior is that's someone
25:02

32:16
like to share
32:16
a couple of our events we've already got
32:18
planned for this year
32:20
you know i travel many different places
32:22
not just here
32:24
in the state of florida but all over
32:25
america in canada and even overseas i
32:29
actually will be in greece
32:30
this year i'll also be in the caribbean
32:33
many other places but we have our own
32:35
events
32:36
that one quest international that is my
32:39
company
32:40
and myself we sponsor those events
32:43
they're always held right here in our
32:45
city
32:46
and the first one we have during the
32:48
year that you actually can travel to and
32:50
be a part of
32:51
is called heaven's invitation
32:55
that is not us saying what we want to
32:57
say that is god
32:58
saying what he wants to say and angels
33:02
are always present in those meetings
33:04
we may have a host id workshop even to
33:07
help you identify them in the sky
33:10
let me tell you they've always been here
33:11
it's about time we recognize that heaven
33:13
has an army
33:14
and they are here to work with us that
33:17
is one of the things we always cover in
33:19
heaven's invitation
33:20
it is heaven inviting you to find out
33:24
about that glorious place filled with
33:25
splendor and wonder where god
33:27
lives where his throne is and so i look
33:30
forward to seeing you that will be june
33:32
25th
33:32
26th and 27th of this year
33:36
and i believe that we may or may not
33:39
have registration open yet i think that
33:41
may happen
33:42
sometime this month at least by the end
33:44
of the month you can all
33:45
register it is a free event we do not
33:49
charge you to come to that event but you
33:51
have to register so we have an idea of
33:53
how many people are coming
33:55
so as soon as that is open make sure you
33:57
get on go to revealingheaven.com
34:00
and sign up click on the events and sign
34:02
up for heaven's invitation
34:04
and then after heaven's invitation in
34:06
september
34:08
we have our men's event it is called the
34:11
dread
34:11
champions why do we call them that
34:14
because
34:14
hell will dread them and that is the
34:18
purpose for having that if you want to
34:20
know what a manifested son of god
34:22
looks like how they live well what
34:25
happened in the spirit realm when they
34:26
begin to rule in this earth
34:28
you need to come men and i think that's
34:31
from the younger teens
34:33
all the way up to any age of men to come
34:35
we have a powerful time
34:37
we have a couple of the speakers i
34:39

34:40
you're not going to escape that we have
34:42

34:47

34:59

35:01

on the go with cat so when you see that
38:59
you're going to know this is going to be
39:00
something exciting or fun
39:01
or interesting and so if you're watching
39:05
[Music]
39:13
so anyway that was awesome wasn't it
39:16
anyway i love doing things where i can
39:19
connect with people
39:20
you know i come from a really big family
39:22
for those who don't know me at all
39:24
guess what what about the pink hair i am
39:27
going to answer that question we
39:28
recently had a question from somebody
39:31
why do you have the pink hair so there's
39:33
some people who've known why for like 15
39:35
years
39:36
right i've had this pink hair for a very
39:38
long time
39:40
it's because god asked me to have this
39:42
pink hair
39:43
why heaven is different it is fantastic
39:46
it is amazing
39:47
and i represent heaven wherever i go and
39:50
he wanted me to show it on the outside
39:52
so how about that heaven's exciting and
39:55
because he asked me to do it
39:56
i obeyed i think god would appreciate it
39:59
when we
40:00
listen we hear and we obey that is what
40:03
he loves so this is just
40:05
really obedience of course i was not a
40:07
pink care person
40:08
that would make it too easy for me but i
40:11
have gotten used to it
40:13
and i want to bless the heart of god and
40:15
so guess what yes
40:17
i get it done every four weeks god
40:19
didn't put this pink hair on my head
40:21
i actually have to pay for it so again
40:23
guardians own people thank you so much
40:25
for supporting me
40:27
we have many things planned for the
40:28
future it's going to be really exciting
40:30
around here
40:31
and a lot of action going on not just
40:34
here in our studio but around this
40:37
world don't take your eyes off of korea
40:40
god is still doing something with that
40:43
also hollywood i am involved now in
40:46
helping to create a spirit realm input
40:50
for the resurrection of jesus christ
40:51
movie and by the way i just need to give
40:54
a tip
40:54
it's not the one with mel gibson we
40:56
bless mel gibson
40:57
and pray for him continually he gave us
41:00
a passion was that not amazing
41:03
but this one is being done through a
41:04
different whole group
41:06
you go to the resurrection of jesus
41:08
christ
41:10
website you'll probably see me talking
41:13
on that website
41:14
and find out some more information
41:15
they'll be putting a lot more on there
41:17
we're working really hard i do sketches
41:19
of the spirit realm
41:20
of heaven of hell because i've been to
41:22
those places and then my prophetic
41:24
artist makes them
41:25
amazing and these are scenes and
41:29
images and beings that will actually be
41:31
in that movie
41:33
so god notified me that i would be
41:35
involved in this several years ago
41:37
so i was preparing myself all along to
41:39
be a part but it's absolutely amazing
41:42
that we will get to change the way
41:44
people think about jesus christ about
41:46
heaven about how
41:47
the reality of both of those places and
41:50
also
41:52
what really happened in the spirit realm
41:55
in the garden on the cross in hell on
41:58
the third day when christ
41:59
wasted the principalities and powers and
42:01
took the keys
42:03
of hell death and the grave you'll be
42:04
seeing on the big screen
42:06
in a few years it's it's a it's a big
42:09
project
42:09
but i'm going to enjoy being a part of
42:11
it we do a lot of on the on the go with
42:13
cat
42:13
you see a lot of those things happening
42:15
and i give you tips about what goes on
42:16
with the making of a movie
42:18
and so i'm looking forward to being a
42:20
part of that also
42:22
don't take your eyes off of london
42:26
especially concerning the royalty boy
42:28
there's stuff going on right now
42:30
isn't there we're gonna hear about that
42:32
from here too uh i'm sure that i have
42:34
we'll have a lot more to share later
42:36
but uh we love queen elizabeth we pray
42:38
for her we pray for that whole country
42:40
you know we
42:41
america was kind of birthed out of that
42:43
country i do know in the habitation of
42:46
god
42:46
coming to this earth that america and
42:49
england
42:50
will be doing things hand in hand for
42:53
that
42:53
move of god in this earth so don't take
42:55
your eyes off of there either
42:57
there's a lot of other things going on
42:59
in this world i know there's violence in
43:00
some areas there's disasters in some
43:03
areas
43:03
we're learning to take authority over
43:05
all that because as a believer that is
43:07
your right to rule and reign with christ
43:10
to have authority over the weather
43:12
because we're over it not under it
43:14
we also host weather warriors here we
43:17
host um
43:18
the the host initiative which is the
43:21
army of heaven working with us
43:23
we also of course i already mentioned
43:24
drug champions and wonder women we have
43:26
a lot going on god has put
43:28
on our plate and we're going to be doing
43:31
great with all those things
43:32
don't take your eyes off of trump now
43:35
that's hard to do
43:36
right because you know this broadcast
43:39
couldn't go by
43:40
without me mentioning trump who will win
43:43
in
43:43
2020 look forward to celebrating with
43:46
him i
43:46
already am i'm sure that i'll be at the
43:49
um
43:50
inaugural prayer breakfast in washington
43:53
dc
43:54
uh last time i actually got to pray for
43:57
not in person but i did pray for the
43:58
president for pence
44:00
and at that time it was awesome i will
44:03
be doing a capitol hill
44:05
broadcast sometime this year i'll let
44:07
you know in advance if you're
44:08
in washington dc at that time stop by
44:11
the capitol
44:12
outside and say hi to us i'll make sure
44:15
you get those days
44:16
it's going to be amazing god will be
44:18
exposing darkness
44:20
but i'm telling you he chose trump and
44:22
he has not done with him yet
44:25
i look forward to all that god is going
44:27
to do through him through his
44:28
administration
44:30
and you know don't worry about the fake
44:32

literally over the streets of gold
47:17
there's this beautiful cloud that's got
47:19
all these like
47:20
thousands and thousands of pieces it
47:22
looks like little pieces of glitter
47:24
every one of those is a witty idea an
47:25
invention and god
47:27
sends waves of that idea zone down to
47:30
the earth and drops them into the mind
47:32
of man that's how we get all those
47:33
amazing ideas
47:35

48:42
thing you do in your life is to make

48:45
of life because you won't like
48:47
the other option okay been the hell been
48:50

48:59
with adventure and let me tell you when
49:01

only they won't be normal either there's
49:29
not much that's normal about heaven
49:31
everything is given to you for free all
49:34
right
49:35
you breathe in the life of god all the
49:37
time
49:38
you travel on light you travel unsound
49:41
even your very worship you travel in
49:43
heaven
49:44
fantastic amazing places i think i'm
49:46
going to have to have a special segment
49:48
every now and then
49:49
that is nothing but about having people
49:51
really
49:52
want to know what is it like and i tell
49:55
people all the time
49:56
instead of a funeral home they need to
49:57
have party depots
50:00
and that's where you sent from here to
50:02
go live in heaven in your spiritual body
50:05
your physical body will be resting
50:07
that's what sleeps
50:09
because people say what about the dead
50:10
in christ when they rise that
50:12
is your body your body is sleeping but
50:15
your spirit man
50:17
is very much alive in heaven
50:22
eating the best food that ever existed
50:24
with no weight gain or food allergies

50:28
said that and i want to say hi to all my
50:31

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXlG7gReb4Q
or https://youtu.be/SXlG7gReb4Q

00:04
and
00:05
being so happy i hope you are
00:09
by the way i just want to start by
00:12
saying
00:13
i have talked to several my prophet
00:14
friends just to make sure they're
00:16
celebrating and guess what they
00:18
are they have an all jumped ship
00:23
hope you haven't jumped ship if you have
00:24
we'll throw you a life raft
00:27
anyway i had to of course come on i'm
00:30
gonna come on every other day
00:32
as long as we're still up i'll still be
00:34
speaking
00:35
and guess what i'm running forward with
00:38
my race
00:39
running forward with life with joy with
00:42
celebration
00:42
and with god in his plans and yes
00:46
according to the title of this post
00:50
the shaking has begun and i'm serious
00:53
about that
00:54
i'll tell you why i'm excited you should
00:55
go back and look at on the largest
00:57
streams
00:58
the broadcast we did on november the 4th
01:02
and what god himself had to say about
01:04
all of this
01:05
guess what he didn't give a date and i'm
01:08
not giving a date i actually never have
01:10
given a date
01:11
i let god choose his time because man
01:14
has their own time frame
01:16
some people can wait a few days some a
01:18
couple weeks but man i don't think
01:19
anybody can go past a month
01:22
except the ones who really know what god
01:24
said and i can tell you what god's doing
01:26
yes there is a line being drawn who will
01:29
believe him and stand with him
01:31
and who he can use and accelerate in
01:33
these powerful days ahead
01:35
and who will have to catch up so i hope
01:37
you're not on the ketchup side
01:40
that could mean several things i won't
01:42
go there however i do want to tell
01:45
everyone hello all you people who are
01:47
still standing with what god said i
01:49
celebrate you i congratulate you
01:54
you have blessed the heart of god that
01:56
you're not giving up your stand
01:58
we all know what the bible says when you
02:00
make a stand stand therefore
02:02
you also know what it says right when
02:04
you're going forward in the kingdom
02:05
don't stab back
02:09
or what you will not be fit
02:12
in shape or ready for the kingdom
02:16
so there you go that's god's words to
02:19
you
02:20
i hope you all who switched and jumped
02:22
to the side of darkness and that's all
02:24
there is is darkness and light right now
02:26
get out of there while you can and be
02:29
one of the ones who made a stand that
02:31
you can celebrate and run in the streets
02:32
and shout and yell
02:34
that's exactly what's going to happen
02:37
because
02:37
life will win god always says to choose
02:41
life stand with life participate with
02:43
life
02:44
not the other side you remember we
02:47
prayed for mark zuckerberg right so he
02:49
knows
02:50
he still has a chance to switch back and
02:53
do what he did when he started all this
02:55
he just he designed
02:57
and made a wonderful place for all of us
02:59
to come and fellowship together
03:01
get to see different pictures and videos
03:03
and laugh
03:04
and enjoy them and enjoy life and
03:07
something happened to him please be
03:09
praying for him okay
03:11
this is a great place to do social
03:13
networking
03:14
and that's why it was designed but you
03:17
can't
03:18
let them ban you because you want god or
03:20
you want what is right or you want life
03:23
and so in them who don't even know what
03:24
they're saying you don't realize what
03:26
you're saying
03:27
when you don't want to be on the other
03:29
side and not decide god has chosen
03:33
if you think he's run away and he's
03:34
hiding somewhere in heaven
03:36
that is not true
03:40
did you feel the groan shake yet because
03:43
you will
03:44
you remember on november 4th god himself
03:47
said
03:47
when the ground begins to shake get
03:50
ready for the landslide
03:54
to expose everything
03:57
and you know what god's plans are you've
03:59
heard me say it from the very beginning
04:02
from 2015 guess what he's not changed
04:05
his plan
04:07
what he is do is exposing all the
04:08
darkness he's going to clean that
04:10
platform off
04:12
no matter where they are what they're
04:13
saying what they're doing god's
04:14
preparing us for the next
04:16
20 years of greatness no you don't have
04:19
to get used to wearing masks for the
04:21
rest of your life you don't have to
04:22
social distance for the rest of your
04:24
life
04:25
god intends to actually take the virus
04:27
off the earth
04:28
maybe he'll put it with the other ones
04:29
who were running away i don't know
04:32
i just know this i know what god's plans
04:34
are he hasn't changed them
04:36
and unless he tells me differently i am
04:38
not changing my stand
04:40
i will be right here releasing justice
04:43
releasing the host of heaven and by the
04:46
way
04:47
yesterday released 50
04:51
billion of the host of heaven and if you
04:54
did not know this
04:55
god calls florida over the skies of
04:58
florida he calls it his
04:59
battle station on earth what does that
05:01
mean that means their billions of the
05:04
hosts posted there to be sent out on
05:06
assignment
05:07
and he had me send 50 billion yes
05:11
people he has a lot no one knows but him
05:15
you haven't counted them
05:17
you probably haven't even seen them
05:18
you'd probably be hiding if you had
05:20
the host of heaven are not beautiful
05:22
pretty boys with blonde hair
05:25
and harps they have weapons coming out
05:28
of them
05:29
the frequency of god the fire of god
05:31
they fight with lightning bolts
05:33
and guess what some of the ones who've
05:36
been assigned now
05:38
are the same ones who fought in the
05:39
flesh on behalf of israel go back and
05:41
read it in the bible
05:44
how one angel took up so many hundreds
05:47
of thousands that shocked them all
05:50
we have some of those fighting with us
05:54
i enjoy commanding the host of heaven
05:56
and they enjoy going on assignments
05:58
they need orders from headquarters and
06:00
let me tell you headquarters
06:02
in heaven is very excited about these
06:05
days
06:06
i know you've heard several times
06:08
different people sending things around
06:10
i'm sure some of it's conspiracy stuff
06:12
some of it's just being made up to make
06:14
you feel better some of it's actually
06:15
the real thing
06:17
you should decide on what you think it
06:18
is i just say this
06:20
get plenty of supplies including cake
06:23
and maybe for a couple weeks or so
06:25
just to save you a trip to the grocery
06:27
store this is not a time for death and
06:30
destruction for us
06:31
this is not a time for civil war in a
06:34
civil war you have to have a divided
06:35
nation
06:36
we have a pocket of people who'd rather
06:39
have communism
06:40
here i said it the rest of us almost 80
06:44
million of us that's the majority in
06:46
case you can't count
06:49
we want life liberty freedom justice and
06:51
righteousness in this nation
06:53
and we are going to get it
06:56
if god can save a world when eight
06:59
people
07:00
are praying how much do you think he can
07:03
do
07:04
with millions of people praying for this
07:07
nation for its destiny
07:09
and also the impact that will have
07:12
around this world there are millions and
07:15
millions of people
07:16
praying and agreeing with you what you
07:18
shouldn't do is begin to bash one
07:20
another
07:21
you're speaking the enemy's words
07:24
i'll bash evil all day long then i'm
07:27
gonna bash
07:28
the ones he made god sends people to
07:31
this earth they're already anointed
07:33
they're already appointed
07:35
i happen to be just one of those but i
07:38
will not lose my stand and i will
07:40
not back up
07:43
because these are powerful days if
07:46
people say what's going on their

08:42
way that they're thinking
08:44

08:46
spirit just like the devil says to yours

09:14
to keep in the white house and
09:17
it doesn't matter to me when god

09:41
grabbing they were hugging each other
09:43
without masks
09:44
people nobody cared
09:47
because freedom and liberty had come to
09:49

10:32
hosts have been loosed

11:08
come and share
11:09
with you all just a couple of
11:11
earthquakes that have taken place
11:14
uh over the over the last couple days
11:16
and especially the one that happened on
11:18
the fourth
11:19
there you go john come here
11:22
i'll just stand over here okay go ahead
11:24
and say it loud then
11:26
so um there were quite a lot
11:29
of things that happened especially on
11:31
the fourth i
11:32
pulled up an article and
11:35
i'm trying to find it yeah it's the
11:38
world earthquake report for monday
11:40
january 4th 2021
11:43
and it said that there were 10. 24th of
11:47
november
11:48
january 14th january the 4th okay yeah
11:51
and it says um
11:54
10 of the largest earthquakes in the
11:57
world happened
11:58
and it just lists all the different ones
12:00
and then the ones that were felt
12:02
were places like croatia
12:05
and um let's see there was a couple in
12:09
croatia there was one in south dakota
12:11
there was new zealand and puerto rico
12:15
and if you just go and just you can
12:18
literally see
12:19
every day from from
12:23
on this website including and then when
12:26
she was talking about
12:28
when she sent the host out um
12:32
yesterday how many did you send out 50
12:35
billion 50 billion
12:36
you'd hear that well it
12:39
it's crazy because i pulled up an
12:41
article this morning when i opened up
12:45
the internet and it the first thing it
12:46
said was south florida residents report
12:50
shaking no official reports of
12:52
earthquake
12:53
or explosions and it happened
12:56
in areas like ballard county
13:01
miami-dade monroe counties also
13:04
in um coral i think it's coral
13:07
coral springs and just various people
13:10
were reporting that their house started
13:12
shaking this dad was working with his
13:14
son
13:15
doing virtual school when their chairs
13:17
started to shake and then um
13:20
the rest of the family came running the
13:22
room asking what was that because he
13:24
thought am i imagining this they went
13:26
outside to see if it was like a big
13:28
truck there was no big truck
13:29
they've checked all the size
13:32
were seismographs the um
13:36
geographical whatever people that check
13:38
for for earthquakes they
13:40
there's no reports nothing none of the
13:42
graphs
13:43
moves none of the things and then they
13:45
said well maybe because there's a lot of
13:47
military that maybe they were
13:48
testing the jets because when they they
13:51
do the sonic boom
13:54
but they they so they contacted the
13:56
military bases in the area and they said
13:58
no we did all our jet testing on
14:00
thursday
14:01
nothing was done on friday so at the
14:03
very
14:04
end of the article it says the official
14:06
cause of the shaking and
14:08
rumbling is not yet known yeah because
14:11
you can't see the host leave
14:13
so but you can sure hear them
14:16
so i did share the article in the link
14:18
but um
14:19
there has been a tremendous amount of
14:22
activity
14:23
like i even uh googled earthquake
14:27
um january 12th there was a magnitude
14:30
2.9 earthquake in utah
14:32
um and then that does not mean god will
14:37
destroy with earthquakes that's letting
14:38
you know
14:39
something is happening yeah and if you
14:42
even do
14:42
earthquakes for today you just google
14:46
earthquakes for today it literally shows
14:48
you
14:49
a list of all of the ones that happened
14:51
today
14:52
uh do they have one here today um in the
14:55
u.s
14:56
um let's see i think it was indonesia
15:00
earthquakes today here we go uh
15:04
there was uh 5.5
15:07
in iran a 5.5 in afghanistan i
15:11
understand that completely
15:13
a 5.9 in guatemala a 4.0 in hawaii
15:19
and this one really when i told you this
15:22
one there was a 3.6
15:24
in conrad california which is smack in
15:26
the middle between
15:27
sacramento and san francisco wow and
15:30
what did you say about san francisco
15:32
yeah they just
15:33
put a notice out that they were banning
15:35
trump
15:36
from any kind of broadcast or saying
15:38
anything whatsoever from san francisco
15:41
in their area in their frequencies
15:42
and that's exactly where that earthquake
15:44
happened i think god is saying
15:46
he's not happy about that so this is
15:49
just a little heads up to encourage you
15:51
to let you know
15:52
that shaking has definitely begun and no
15:55
one can turn that back nobody can turn
15:57
back time nobody can stop
15:59
god from what he wants to do i just want
16:01
to encourage you all
16:02
really seriously keep celebration in
16:06
your heart
16:06
again god spoke to me and he said don't
16:09

16:11
keep encouraging them to celebrate like
16:14
freedom
16:15

16:25
talking about the actual social media is
16:27
taken down as the networks are taken
16:28

16:31
remember this god has not

16:46

and you know everybody knows people can
18:45
share stuff from anybody's pages

11:30am Sunday Preaching at LOH Church Omaha 11/29/2020
by Sermon For You Apr 20, 2021
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzKm9dQMNMc
or https://youtu.be/xzKm9dQMNMc

00:00
i do need uh pastors both to come up
00:03
here
00:03
i have some mantles to give out
00:07
both of you if i go there's going to be
00:11
mantles
00:12
and he doesn't do you know i can't just
00:14
say it
00:15
i have to do it that's the way it is
00:17
with me so um
00:18
yeah god has highly honored you and who
00:21
wouldn't right
00:22
i mean even a little bit of time i've
00:24
known you you're passionate you show
00:26
people
00:27
and you're hungry and you are so
00:30
determined and fierce
00:32
those are the kind of people god needs
00:34
to do things for him
00:35
those who want to be quiet and are you
00:37
know i i hid in the i didn't hide he had
00:40
me hidden for years but now of course
00:41
with pink hair you can't hide
00:43
so be glad he didn't ask you to have it
00:48
he was going to make sure i couldn't
00:49
hide and i was known by 40 pastors in
00:52
our city i did all kinds of things for
00:53
them my dad did we just love
00:55
people we didn't care who you were we
00:57
loved you
00:58
about we were fierce against the
01:00
darkness
01:01
and you are totally fierce against the
01:03
darkness
01:05
and i absolutely love the name of your
01:07
church because i have friends who are
01:10
some of the hosts and uh you may think
01:13
that is strange don't think it's strange
01:15
angels appeared all over
01:16
the new in the old testament and
01:18
actually came and ate with
01:20
uh you know some of the greats of that
01:22
day but
01:23
you don't worship them okay it doesn't
01:27
actually say you can't talk to them
01:29
if someone if one gives comes to give
01:30
you a word from god
01:32
make sure you by the way i have to add
01:34
this in there always test
01:35
the spirits there are groups out there
01:38
teaching you to
01:39
you know send yourself somewhere and do
01:41
all kinds of things but you have to test
01:43
and if an angel appears to you and says
01:45
come with me you better ask them
01:47
are you of the spirit of the most high
01:49
god who sent his son to die for the sins
01:50
of this world
01:52
because if they're not they will
01:53
disappear
01:55
and they can't answer wrong with that
01:57
i've done that since i was real little i
02:00
always would test them even though i go
02:01
to heaven all the time
02:02
and i'm around angels all the time they
02:04
live over my home in my home
02:06
and if something appears to me though i
02:09
will still ask them that
02:11
there is a safety measure that needs to
02:13
be taught because more and more
02:15
pastors will find out we are connected
02:18
in the spirit realm with heaven that's
02:19
where our rulership
02:20
is we don't rule over people we rule
02:22
over all the darkness trying to control
02:24
people and some some of those beings
02:28
those demons can appear as angels of
02:30
light and stuff like that i mean they
02:31
can
02:32
they can be very convincing like the
02:33
left is trying to be right now
02:36
but anyway just test the spirit so don't
02:39
reject something i want
02:41
god wants okay he wants you to know him
02:44
he wants to know all about him he wants
02:46
you to understand who you are
02:47
why he sent you in this particular time
02:49
on the earth this is a powerful time the
02:51
divine decade
02:52
but then also 24 years in the white
02:55
house god will have total
02:57
and then after that that 24 years
02:58
prepares us for the next
03:00
100 years if you thought you were
03:03
leaving
03:04
you're not going anywhere so don't hide
03:08
get your crown on roll up your rapture
03:09
rug you can keep it for later or someone
03:11
down the road
03:12
someone generations from now might need
03:14
that okay and i just need to say this
03:16
for free the holy spirit say is free
03:18
the rapture will not be a rescue party
03:22
it will be a celebration of such glory
03:25
and power
03:27
it is a party say it's a party
03:31
it's not a rescue party it's a party
03:34
party
03:37
so uh i i knew what was coming before
03:40
you invited me because you know he told
03:41
me
03:43
and he said you're gonna give out
03:44
mantels to them they both are going to
03:46
get mantles for this new season
03:48
and um that's why when he had me send
03:52
that word through sunil
03:53
he said bill bill bill he is serious
03:56
about the broadcasting i
03:58
believe you will have a network one day
04:01
because you already taken authority
04:05
in that whole system and the frequencies
04:07
in the in the in the ways that come
04:08
through to produce that you're already
04:10
ruling in that
04:12
and by the way the first thing he wants
04:13
me to tell you is you have reached the
04:15
level of
04:15
king in the spirit realm and uh only god
04:19
chooses who the kings the lords and the
04:20
priests are those are spiritual levels
04:22
of authority
04:23
that's why he says you are kings and
04:25
priests and to your god
04:26
that's not just a title that is a
04:29
position
04:31
and i know the church doesn't always
04:33
talk about that either but i understand
04:35
it completely what that means
04:36
so you reach the level of a king in the
04:38
spirit realm you can't go any higher
04:40
than that you're not god okay
04:41
we're lower than him but in the spirit
04:44
according to dominion and authority a
04:46
king is as high as you can get
04:48
and it comes because you fell in love
04:50
with jesus first
04:51
you can't skip jesus okay we can't skip
04:54
the word of god
04:55
you can't just elevate yourself
04:57
somewhere i know people have put
04:58
themselves in the five-fold ministry
05:00
that never belong there and they can get
05:02
away with that but you can't get away
05:03
with saying you're a king
05:04
because when you declare a decree
05:06
nothing will happen if you're not
05:09
but the kings actually have very high
05:11
rulership
05:12
and any king even in the natural realm
05:15
you have an
05:16
army so does the king in the spirit
05:19
realm
05:19
and this day i didn't just come by
05:21
myself i came with millions of the
05:24
army of heaven that i i command them get
05:27
used to that word say we command
05:29
because he commands god said
05:33
here you're going to get some revelation
05:34
on the scripture now when god said
05:36
command ye me he wasn't saying you tell
05:39
me what to do he was saying
05:41
me i want to see you command yes
05:44
command you me me i want to see you
05:47
command
05:48
and that's what he meant we have
05:50
authority and dominion jesus said i give
05:52
you power
05:53
over all the power of the enemy not
05:56
some of it some of the time all of it
05:59
all the time
06:00
but when you rule and take authority
06:02
over it you're ruling
06:04
and so the greater you get in those
06:06
levels of authority you
06:07
increase in many ways and so we may have
06:10
had angels helping us in the past
06:13
but since 2014 a scroll was opened in
06:16
heaven
06:16
that had the words on host initiative
06:20
okay it's that host initiative that's
06:22
what i'm wearing right here this is
06:24
their logo
06:25
they have a logo and it represents the
06:28
army of heaven
06:29
working with us but we are not we are
06:32
over angels right in authority
06:34
the angels are not over us do you
06:36
understand that
06:38
it says in the ages to come we will
06:39
judge them is that right
06:41
that means we have seniority because we
06:44
are we came from the heart of god he
06:46
made them by speaking but we were
06:48
birthed from him
06:49
and so because you've reached that level
06:51
of king he has sent with me
06:53
one million of the hosts of heaven
06:58
that are being positioned here i brought
07:00
my staff i didn't bring it here with me
07:01
but i brought my staff
07:03
to decree for them to be here and so
07:05
they're actually outside this building
07:07
right now one million
07:08
that you will command you will send them
07:10
you'll give them orders
07:12
to go and do things in the spirit realm
07:14
pull down strongholds that you see evil
07:16
or where
07:16
wherever evil and wickedness is going on
07:19
and i mean
07:20
for instance i take power over all the
07:22
part of the enemy
07:23
trying to cheat lie and steal and hide
07:26
and cover up
07:27
so i command the host of heaven to go
07:29
uncover all that that's being hidden
07:32
no matter where it is how long it's been
07:34
there or what it is you will go
07:36
now in jesus name and uncover all of
07:38
that pull down the strongholds of satan
07:40
that are helping them empowering them
07:42
inspiring
07:43
put down those strongholds that they no
07:44
longer can assist them in any weightless
07:46
ever
07:47
shred platforms the evil high levels of
07:49
evil and spirit realm are operating in
07:51
over
07:51
our country over all the stuff we
07:54
command the host of heaven now you go
07:56
and shred those platforms
07:57
when you do that fear begins to fall on
07:59
the humans
08:00
doing the wickedness as long as satan is
08:04
working with them empowering them and
08:06
inspiring them
08:07
they feel bold they feel like they own
08:11
it
08:12
but when that is removed they no longer
08:14
have that
08:16
this is how you rule the spirit realm
08:19
that's taking power over all the power
08:20
of the enemy i'm not controlling people
08:22
but i'm totally telling through the host
08:24
of heaven they were
08:26
made to war for us
08:29
you don't want the spirit roman battle
08:31
anything
08:32
right we are more than conquerors
08:36
they are a weapon for us
08:39
weapons are not natural they are
08:41
spiritual right they are mighty
08:43
say they it didn't say it in the bible
08:47
they are mighty to the pulling down the
08:49
strongholds and one of the ones those
08:50
weapons
08:51
is the army of heaven
08:54
and we get to command them if you're not
08:57
playing games in the darkness
09:01
they hearken unto the word of the lord
09:03
in you so what you say if it doesn't
09:04
sound like the lord or if you're out
09:06
there blasting people
09:07
crushing and hurting people with your
09:09
mouth or your spouse or
09:10
whatever you're doing that's not godly
09:13
they don't have to listen to you
09:16
so there are requirements okay you've
09:19
got to have accountability
09:20
if you have an authority like that you
09:22
have to god knows he can trust you
09:24
he trusts them that's what he said to me
09:27
so this day
09:28
you are being right now your army
09:30
outside right now
09:31
you need to say i choose to invite
09:35
heaven's army to be my weapon
09:39
to fight against the darkness i receive
09:42
them right now
09:50
[Music]
09:52
and i i have i have two mantles that
09:55
came out up here
09:57
uh this one actually belongs to both of
09:59
you but this one is just for you
10:00
[Laughter]
10:03
i'm going to give brenda hers first
10:05
isn't it beautiful
10:07
and so is she to him so chief you're
10:10
beautiful to the lord and so he wants to
10:12
bless you with his mantle
10:14
and it's got many pieces in this mantle
10:17
it's all the things you'll get to do
10:18
that you desire to do because you have
10:21
been willing to do those things that
10:22
aren't the best that aren't always
10:24
comfortable there are always uh uh that
10:28
that maybe other people would not want
10:29
to do you've been willing to say yes to
10:31
love people
10:32
for him to support your husband to love
10:34
your husband
10:35
i would say love your husband love your
10:36
husband you've been willing so he is
10:38
giving you this is actually a mantle of
10:40
beauty
10:41
beauty from heaven and you will get
10:43
great reward
10:45
do this so this is yours in this day
10:48
and i can tell you that we are seated in
10:52
heavenly places because he takes a layer
10:54
of our soul that looks just like you the
10:55
layers in your soul are images of you
10:58
those are your emotions when you give
11:00
yourself to jesus christ he has the
11:02
right to take that and he seats it with
11:03
him in heavenly places so you are really
11:05
seated
11:06
it's not just something suggested it's
11:08
not symbolic there is a layer of view in
11:10
heaven
11:10
looks just like you and at this moment
11:12
he just put that
11:14
mantle upon you it is a mantle of
11:17
greatness
11:19
greatness love and beauty and so there
11:21
you go
11:22
get ready for great things to happen and
11:25
fun things to happen okay amen and i
11:28
know
11:29
this is another mantle
11:43
[Music]
11:45
this is a mantle of presidential
11:49
favor and even though it has trump's
11:52
name he is president
11:54
he will sit as president for four more
11:55
years no matter what anyone else says
11:58
that is god's plan so he's putting on
12:00
you not just for this president
12:03
but for many presidents to come you will
12:06
have favor from god
12:08
and they will have your ear to hear god
12:12
and your hand in friendship
12:15
so this is a mantle right now of
12:17
governmental authority
12:20
presidential favor that's what he called
12:22
a presidential favor
12:24
and that includes you and your wife but
12:26
he wanted me to place it on you
12:28
as a head come here you just get
12:29
underneath there too there you go
12:31
so father right now i i establish and
12:35
set upon your children the mantle of
12:38
presidential
12:39
favor which means they already have
12:42
favor without measure with you
12:44
they will have facial favor without
12:46
measure with the presidents with
12:48
president trump
12:49
and with other presidents coming and so
12:51
long as you have them hear god
12:53
they will carry and operate in this
12:55
mantle
12:56
and they will find out very quickly that
12:58
is going to begin
12:59
soon so receive it in jesus name
13:03
and i bless them god and i thank you for
13:05
the army of heaven that's been assigned
13:07
to them father that it will continue to
13:09
grow
13:09
the more you send them the more you get
13:11
them
13:12
i thank you father in jesus name so be
13:16
it
13:16
yes and i have one more gift for you
13:21
this is a sign of my personal friendship
13:24
with you
13:25
i have one i got one for you the same so
13:28
thank you for being my sister
13:30
[Music]
13:33
god bless you god bless you
13:37
there you go wear it well
13:40
amen now when i came
13:44
i already posted a thousand of the hosts
13:47
of heaven from
13:48
my own the army that he gave me to
13:50
command
13:51
i lost number i don't even know how many
13:53
there are
13:54
and we can actually do that today for
13:56
whoever wants to
13:58
you have to invite i know this protocol
14:00
for heaven
14:01
did you not invite christ into your life
14:03
is that right
14:05
i hope you say yes you invite it's the
14:08
way heaven is you invite
14:09
christ to come into your life you must
14:12
invite
14:12
holy spirit to indwell you is that
14:15
correct
14:16
you have to invite heaven to be a weapon
14:18
for you no they were created for that
14:21
the army of heaven was never
14:24
ever designed to protect heaven
14:28
they don't need it
14:31
and actually they didn't even get to
14:33
throw lucifer out and one-third of the
14:35
angels they didn't get to throw them out
14:38
they wanted to trust me i don't know
14:40
what all these people think about this
14:41
whole thing going on they said there was
14:42
sadness in heaven they were weeping
14:44
they were rejoicing they threw a party
14:46
when they were kicked out
14:49
god does have a government in heaven and
14:51
he has a way that he operates that
14:53
he doesn't abide evil
14:57
it gets unseated it gets kicked out
15:00
and that actually did happen in heaven
15:02
one day and so
15:04
those angels understand stuff that we're
15:06
going through right now they understand
15:07
what we're going through
15:09
some people have lost family members
15:10
over this whole thing
15:12
they really have they've lost businesses
15:14
and business partners and even churches
15:16
have split
15:17
people love churches because they're
15:19
choosing the wrong thing
15:21
the wrong thing right you cannot choose
15:23
or partner with darkness and think
15:25
you're not going to get some kind of a
15:27
consequence of that you cannot side with
15:30
those who want to take
15:32
the life of people who have no love for
15:35
anybody that always is a sign that the
15:38
enemy is involved when life
15:40
want to be taken or controlled or
15:42
crushed uh
15:44
god never put america here actually
15:46
didn't put anyone here for that reason
15:48
but america was made specifically by god
15:51
for his own purposes in his plans
15:53
his will his way that's why even here in
15:56
america as we have fought so many times
15:59
to keep our ability to be free
16:05
but you don't have the right to hurt
16:07
crush and bash people
16:09
and i think the other half the left side
16:12
doesn't even know what that means they
16:13
have
16:14
no lives matter actually is what they
16:16
ought to be if you want to know the
16:17
truth no lives matter to them
16:20
no lives matter to them not even the
16:22
people they're using
16:24
matter to them they don't care
16:27
this is the way the enemy is satan
16:29
doesn't care who he uses he doesn't care
16:31
who he destroys
16:32
he doesn't care who gets stolen from
16:35
and as i so today i am going to talk
16:37
about america
16:39
i can't help that that's god's biggest
16:41
thing right now with me
16:42
back in 2015 the beginning god caught me
16:45
up to heaven and said
16:47
um trump's going to win and he'll be in
16:49
the white house for eight years because
16:50
i need him there
16:53
even though it might seem impossible
16:55
it's going to happen
16:57
he said i'm going to shift america onto
17:00
my
17:00
timeline and into righteousness
17:04
and he said i even have inventions and
17:06
things to be created that i will not
17:08
allow to be created until i've dealt
17:10
with the darkness
17:12
that's in the government and great
17:14
exposure
17:16
to levels people never dreamed of this
17:17
is still god speaking to me
17:19
will happen he said it will be great
17:22
some people will not understand it
17:24
they'll think i've abandoned them i have
17:26
not abandoned them i'm actually setting
17:27
up
17:28
their lives for the next 100 years
17:33
[Applause]
17:38
this country is a light to this world
17:40
that light will get
17:41
greater the body of christ will learn
17:45
how to operate in authority and dominion
17:47
and it will be so hard for anything like
17:50
what we are experiencing to ever happen
17:52
again
17:53
not until the perilous time is coming
17:55
nobody knows that day
17:58
don't plan your life around when the
17:59
perilous times are
18:01
don't plan your life around the rapture
18:04
you have way too much to do
18:07
we're just beginning to understand the
18:10
operations of the spirit roman even who
18:12
we really
18:12
are we are meant to be in authority in
18:16
this earth
18:18
we're not under anything
18:24
if you belong to jesus christ he's not
18:26
under anything
18:27
either
18:30
on earth as it is in heaven is what god
18:32
has always desired
18:34
and yes god does have a dream
18:37
it is him and mankind operating together
18:40
as one
18:43
and so great days have to happen on this
18:45
earth
18:46
there has to be those days and everybody
18:49
thinks well some people think
18:50
i always get corrected but if i change
18:52
what i just instantly said the holy
18:53
spirit just tell me what to say
18:56
some people think it's the end because
18:57
things are so awful
18:59
they're not awful okay i know they may
19:02
be hard and inconvenient and i know yes
19:04
people have been affected by this
19:06
that was not god's plan but there is an
19:08
enemy in this world and when he can find
19:10
people who are wicked and evil to do his
19:13
plan they're going to do it if they've
19:14
already said yes to him
19:16
they're going to do it and that can
19:18
affect our life
19:19
but in the future it will be much harder
19:22
because of the discernment we'll be
19:24
walking in the understanding of who we
19:26
are living and taking authority
19:28
uh practically almost everywhere in this
19:30
world wherever the body of christ lives
19:32
he actually is going to create regions
19:34
of light in this country
19:39
probably the first country because he
19:40
calls this god
19:42
called his gift to this world i know his
19:44
son is
19:45
but he means literally it is a gift for
19:48
hope
19:49
for a future where to find him how to
19:51
know him
19:52
how to live free free
20:02
in order to live free you have to have
20:05
justice
20:06
you can't be free without justice so
20:09
what is god doing today
20:11
serving out justice
20:13
[Applause]
20:16
he said i could not allow trump just to
20:18
win normally
20:20
he won oh trust me he won
20:26
he did win but he said i couldn't let
20:28
him win the normal way because the
20:29
darkness would have remained hidden
20:34
what he's got planned for us is so great
20:37
and the ability to do things and help
20:39
people and even
20:41
change things drastically for the better
20:45
and the greater would be a better word
20:47
to use
20:49
for the greater of god's purposes in
20:51
this country he had to deal with the
20:53
darkness that's been hidden for years
20:57
so he already had a plan
21:01
it wasn't the scam democrat
21:05
and it wasn't the pandemic which by the
21:07
way has been lied about most of the time
21:13
because god said they'll use anything
21:15
they can to keep people away from each
21:16
other keep their mouths
21:18
muffled and not speak and say anything
21:20
don't let them gather together because
21:22
then they'll know
21:23
truth because they'll be together it's
21:24
they're too strong together
21:26
so they came up with a lot of these
21:28
plans
21:30
amen
21:31
[Applause]
21:34
and all this that was going on god said
21:36
i haven't changed my plan it's working
21:41
and he said i will the only one i'll be
21:43
the only one who gets the glory for all
21:45
this but of course he wants the glory
21:47
amen
21:51
so he already knew this stuff would
21:52
happen he knew it
21:54
but we who are the body should
21:58
always remain strong
22:02
really strong if you represent christ in
22:05
this world you represent heaven on earth
22:06
we represent heaven on earth
22:09
one day you'll go there if you die
22:15
y'all stand at me
22:19
what if you chose you to remain
22:22
but if you're here for the millennial
22:24
reign would you want that
22:28
there will be some that will i'm not
22:31
planning on dying
22:34
he won't let me talk about dying he
22:37
won't let me talk about retiring there
22:38
is no retirement okay
22:41
you don't retire in heaven you have a
22:42
lot of fun and recreation and
22:45
using your powerful gift that you love
22:48
whether it's tennis or horseback riding
22:50
or running a
22:51
rodeo or a old antique car show or if
22:54
you're a baker if you're in the theater
22:56
it's all in heaven
22:58
it's your gift he put it in you before
23:02
he sent you here
23:05
raise up a child in the way in the bent
23:07
in the gift i gave them to be and
23:09
they'll never depart from it
23:12
that's actually what that scripture this
23:13
revelation it's one of the first things
23:15
he taught me
23:16
he said parents that sit there all week
23:18
long trying to figure out what their
23:20
child's spiritual gift is
23:23
is true we'll all sit here and figure
23:25
out what what is my spiritual gift
23:27
well in heaven you don't use your
23:28
spiritual gift people
23:31
that's why we all think we'll be bored
23:35
it's the passion he put in you it's what
23:37
he gave you that you're good at that you
23:39
think about night and day if you could
23:40
be paid to do it you do it
23:44
your whole mansion is being designed
23:46
around that gift
23:48
if you were gonna have a rodeo you'd
23:49
have thousands of horses you have all
23:51
the property you have real supernatural
23:53
places for people to come and
23:54
be a part of that and the horse would be
23:56
yelling you the whole time oh i'm
23:57
bucking you
23:58
[Laughter]
24:00
it's heaven
24:06
but right now he wants you here
24:09
he needs you here he needs you to not
24:13
just be
24:14
he doesn't want you just to wake up he
24:16
wants you to wake up
24:18
stand up and stand out
24:22
you need to stand out by the way you
24:25
live your life the choices you make
24:27
that you make your stain and you don't
24:29
back down
24:32
you do not let fear interfere in your
24:36
life
24:38
fear should have no part of you he has
24:40
not
24:41
given us a spirit of fear
24:45
and i know a lot of people think well he
24:46
didn't send you know spirits of fear
24:48
no in your spirit
24:51
man he never put fear
24:57
that is something that comes from the
24:59
enemy the enemy brings fear but god
25:01
didn't give you a spirit of fear
25:02
he didn't put fear in your spirit man
25:07
it's not even in you he doesn't send you
25:09
with it in you
25:13
you should be free from that he wants
25:16
you
25:18
again
25:23
you know who you are in christ when you
25:26
become
25:26
dangerous against hell
25:29
they don't want to be around you they
25:31
beg not to be assigned to you
25:34
do
25:38
because they know when they go back and
25:39
they haven't fulfilled their assignment
25:41
to get you dragged
25:42
into the darkness they will be beaten
25:44
satan doesn't reward anybody
25:47
he does control with fear even in hell
25:52
so his plan is for us all to be
25:54
dangerous against
25:57
then there's no way fear can get in you
26:00
there's no place for it to even enter in
26:02
you're so
26:02
full of him so full of the authority he
26:06
gave you and the knowledge of him
26:07
and understanding and having revelation
26:09
from him revelation on the word
26:11
revelation is a lifestyle
26:16
heaven culture isn't just a something
26:20
it is a lifestyle
26:26
then you are dangerous
26:29
and every word that comes out of your
26:30
mouth will be powerful because it's
26:32
filled with love with life with hope
26:35
he said always be ready with an answer
26:38
yeah the issue is there but the answer
26:42
is
26:42
him so how well do you know him
26:49
if you want to know him more you pursue
26:51
it
26:53
amen
26:56
i was raised as a child one of fifteen
27:00
i knew it wasn't about me when i was
27:04
three
27:06
why because there were others already in
27:07
the household by the time i was eight i
27:09
was a mini parent
27:12
i didn't have anything given to me on a
27:14
golden platter
27:15
but i sure was watching those platters
27:20
60 loads of laundry a week 50 pounds of
27:23
potato a week
27:25
to peel
27:29
and all those chiefs to watch over
27:32
because
27:32
none of them were indians okay none of
27:34
them
27:35
don't mean that in the wrong way they
27:38
were leaders
27:39
and they knew it that's why he had to
27:43
give a sear into the household they
27:45
couldn't get away with nothing
27:49
i knew what they were doing if i was not
27:51
even there
27:54
i wasn't easy to live with i'm still not
27:56
easy to live with
27:58
we'll go place oh we need to pray about
28:00
that okay don't go in there
28:02
don't sit there cleanse it for the
28:03
kingdom there are scum on it
28:06
i don't sit anywhere without going i
28:08
cleanse it for the kingdom let me never
28:10
switch mics
28:12
it's probably my electron whatever
28:17
oh does it you having a there is an
28:20
electro
28:20
energy i can't remember how they tell me
28:22
i can't wear a watch
28:24
even in the natural is speeds
28:28
it does something
28:34
so god made me before he sent me he sent
28:37
me as a seer
28:38
that is god's right but there are people
28:41
who have that gift that also can the
28:43
enemy knows
28:45
if you have that gift by your reactions
28:47
and how you how you respond and say
28:49
things about things
28:50
but so since it was little i could see
28:52
angels or demons i saw either one
28:55
and by the time i was like 10 11 12. i
28:57
knew how the enemy operated i could go
28:59
tell people don't go there don't do that
29:01
this is what happens in the spirit when
29:02
you do that you don't want that to
29:04
you know and they look at me like i was
29:06
wild i didn't care
29:08
he also gave me an attitude of i don't
29:10
care i don't care what you think
29:12
it doesn't bother me i am not afraid of
29:14
the face of man i've seen the face of
29:16
god
29:18
and by the way yes you can see the face
29:20
of god
29:21
if you receive jesus christ as your
29:23
savior you think you're going to get
29:24
holier when you get there
29:27
you think you have to have a special
29:28
pass when you die to get into the throne
29:30
room to see him
29:32
say no you've been washing the blood of
29:35
the lamb
29:37
your name is written in the lamb's book
29:38
of life
29:40
he is building your mansion
29:45
i do love it that he used john the
29:48
beloved the one who jesus loved i
29:50
i just john was a showman he really was
29:52
he was the son of thunder what
29:54
do you think yeah him and his brother
29:57
used to fight over
29:58
pretty girls in the beginning of jesus
30:02
ministry
30:04
one day god the father took me back and
30:06
showed me a day in the life of christ
30:09
when he was just starting a minister and
30:11
he had the the rabble
30:13
i'm talking about the disciples
30:16
the ones who were with him right and
30:19
they had left people and they left
30:21
things that they were doing
30:23
and luke had patience running down the
30:25
street asking him why did you leave us
30:26
for him
30:28
this is this is a this is him going into
30:30
minister christ and all these people
30:31
they were throwing stones at the tax
30:33
collector
30:35
because the tax culturals didn't usually
30:36
go out and mingle
30:39
they stayed in their little shop okay
30:41
and you come in paid
30:42
but when cuz because he was out there he
30:44
was a target so here's them they're
30:46
ducking from the stones for him
30:48
listening to the patients yelling at
30:50
luke why did you leave him for us
30:51
and then there's james and john fighting
30:53
along the side of the road over two
30:54
pretty girls
30:56
this is jesus a mighty man sent by god
30:59
to share the good news
31:01
and this is who's walking with him and
31:03
there's the other one with his
31:04
hand in the money bag all the time
31:08
and the father said i didn't make it
31:10
easy for him
31:12
either
31:17
because i also am the ce ceo of one
31:21
quest international
31:23
i actually do have a position i have a
31:25
corporation
31:27
it's called one quest for one god to
31:30
create heaven on earth to reveal and
31:33
create heaven on earth
31:34
and so i do have uh i worked in the
31:36
business world for 25 years and i loved
31:38
it
31:38
then god said okay i'm taking you out of
31:40
your cushy job
31:42
i'm taking you out and then i'm going to
31:43
take your husband out a year later
31:45
so you're really going to have to love
31:46
me and believe me
31:50
we slept on people's floors for a while
31:51
i still celebrated i didn't change who i
31:53
was
31:54
i worshiped i gave i served the whole
31:57
time we were sleeping on people's floors
31:59
and people thought we were crazy and my
32:01
daughter spent
32:02
their birth each had a birthday sleeping
32:04
on somebody's floor
32:07
we ate whatever was there put everything
32:09
we had in the storage and
32:10
just trusted god at the end of one year
32:14
somebody walks up with keys to a million
32:16
dollar condo
32:18
at pond division beach and said here you
32:20
go just stay here long as you want
32:23
didn't cost us a penny or a dime because
32:25
we did not
32:26
change who we were even in the midst of
32:30
something that people would say it was a
32:31
disaster
32:34
my own daughters called it an adventure
32:38
they belong to me okay we had adventures
32:42
we never had disasters we never had a
32:44
crisis it was an adventure
32:48
you have to live like that so people see
32:51
you
32:51
if they don't understand oh no i love
32:53
him more than anyone else
32:55
i'm in his hand not some other somebody
32:57
of the person's hand
33:00
i trusted him
33:06
it's a way of life
33:09
and then i said yes every time he wanted
33:11
something every time he required
33:12
something to me i never said
33:13
never said no to him i'll be almost 70.
33:16
i forget how old i am it doesn't matter
33:20
i'm getting younger
33:23
because i'm claiming timeless you tell
33:25
me that one day do you want to old do
33:26
you want to get old
33:28
well not particularly well then do you
33:29
want to be timeless
33:31
i said yes he said whatsoever you say
33:33
you don't doubt in your heart
33:35
but believe that it will come to pass
33:36
you'll have whatever you say so i'm
33:38
timeless
33:40
and i have pink hair
33:46
and god asked me to have the pink hair
33:47
that really gets some pastors
33:52
not the black ones
33:55
oh no girl
33:58
they like this
34:02
there's a white woman who preaches
34:05
and she has a pink hair we gotta have
34:07
her come
34:09
that's not what the white one said you
34:10
are too over threads you have fallen off
34:12
the edge
34:13
god would never do that no we can't do
34:15
that to the people
34:17
and say your people come to my meetings
34:25
they will find some way to find me
34:27
because they want revelation about
34:29
heaven about god about who they are
34:32
they're hungry you need to take it up a
34:35
notch in your church
34:37
[Applause]
34:40
it is very true i have like what fifteen
34:43
thousand
34:44
black friends i do
34:48
and they won't let me leave they make me
34:50
they make me speak four or five hours
34:52
they don't care if people miss dinner if
34:53
they miss lunch they don't
34:55
they don't even care they reset the
34:58
clock i don't know how many times i went
35:00
to this one church
35:05
i went to this really nice church i was
35:07
invited i went to help rescue this
35:08
little
35:09
woman pastor she was gonna get out of
35:12
the ministry because she was being beat
35:13
up by other pastors saying she didn't
35:15
belong there
35:16
and so i went to this little tiny place
35:18
outside of washington dc and
35:20
after three days she was ready to never
35:22
quit
35:24
and this other the other they found out
35:26
about me so they come so i stayed in
35:27
like this little hotel that had cracks
35:29
under the door
35:30
that you know you stuff things
35:32
underneath it hoping nothing to crawl in
35:35
that's where i had to stay when i was
35:37
there and then the other one
35:38
said oh we found out you're in the area
35:40
we're going to let you minister and they
35:41
sent limos
35:44
and they put me in the wealthiest hotel
35:46
in washington dc
35:48
and they had a congregation of 5000
35:51
people
35:52
and i had given all my money to this
35:54
other little pastor to help her
35:56
and um and god said he he gets so
35:59
blessed that my heart is to love that
36:01
was my
36:02
my earthly dad heart was to whatever i
36:04
get i'm giving away
36:06
that's why i have margaret
36:09
margaret was created to make money and
36:11
keep it i was created to give it away so
36:13
he had to put us both together she's my
36:14
sister-in-law by the way
36:16
and she married my brother that took
36:18
enough bravery right there
36:21
you ever heard me talk about rj there's
36:23
margaret she's r.j's
36:25
wife his solution to all this would just
36:29
be to kill all the bad people send him
36:30
to hell then we'll have a nice
36:32
nice time to that with my brother don't
36:34
ask him to counsel you if you are in sin
36:39
he will seriously say that i'll get my
36:41
gun
36:42
and we'll deal with it and as you're
36:44
dying over hell maybe you'll change your
36:46
mind
36:50
he really gets invitations from black
36:52
pastors
36:54
you're a man you come into my church
36:58
you didn't know you never know what
37:00
you're gonna get when i speak okay
37:03
my life was not very normal
37:08
but rj is my brother he's my older
37:10
brother and so
37:12
he got into all kinds of things he'd he
37:14
would always ask me because you know
37:16
he'd say i'm i'm braver than you
37:17
so you won't do this i i did not not
37:19
like send dangerous things or dumb
37:21
things but
37:22
like you won't stick your finger in this
37:23
tube because i will and you won't and i
37:25
did and then the fire pit department had
37:27
to come cut it off
37:29
those kind of things were seven eight
37:30
and nine years old so i went through
37:32
this whole testing time when my brother
37:33
too finally went you know i'm not dumb
37:35
anymore i'm not doing
37:36
it
37:39
but r.j usually if there's a killing
37:41
going on
37:42
they'll be he'll be there before the
37:44
police they'll find or he'll find the
37:46
villain for the police board
37:49
and he also was in the uh in the
37:51
military also but he's always been so
37:53
fierce
37:54
about un injustice he's friends with all
37:57
of our police department all of our fire
37:58
department
37:59
the military and he's about my size
38:03
and he's not afraid of anything hell's
38:05
angels invite him into their
38:06
to do funerals for them
38:10
because they'd rather get rid of you to
38:11
look at you but they know he's a godly
38:12
man
38:13
and he's he he's a biker he creates
38:15
hearties and stuff like that
38:17
so he's not normal he'll minister to
38:19
people in nursing homes we're about to
38:21
go to heaven
38:22
if you're wicked that person he'll send
38:24
you either there to the other place
38:28
and i grew up with him
38:32
was enough to humble anybody trust me
38:35
so we have all kinds of a mix in my
38:38
family then we have all the adopted ones
38:40
like really adopted
38:42
and so my dad was creative so we always
38:44
had fun things to do exciting things to
38:46
do at home
38:47
feed the 200 pets we could do a funeral
38:51
for a pet at the drop of a hat i guess
38:54
god thought maybe one day we'd actually
38:56
do real ones
38:57
i wouldn't do a normal one we'd have
39:00
cake
39:01
lined up by the casket
39:04
they'd have it in heaven right
39:08
we would have to have music we'd have to
39:09
have dancing and we'd have to have cake
39:12
if you want to do it the way they do it
39:14
in heaven
39:16
that's how they do it in heaven you go
39:18
up there you're having a celebration
39:20
party they have lots of cake everybody
39:21
dances in the throne and the father
39:23
greets you he gives you rewards
39:25
you get to go see your amazing mansion
39:27
and the whole time we're down here
39:28
mourning and grieving
39:30
upset we didn't have enough money to
39:32
spend on them when they don't need it
39:33
anymore
39:35
get cremated it's cheaper the holy
39:39
spirit told me to say that one time
39:41
tell me to get cremated it's okay we can
39:43
put the ashes back together
39:47
that that's what the holy spirit said so
39:49
there's a holy spirit quote right there
39:52
straight from heaven
39:53
we know where the ashes are okay
39:58
you can't get clean what if you died in
39:59
a fire and burn up you don't get your
40:01
body
40:04
you're going to get that body back
40:05
people you better be happy about it
40:08
it'll look amazing
40:12
in the bible it says you will be known
40:14
as you are known
40:16
you can't be someone else and he doesn't
40:18
want you to be someone else right now
40:21
don't let people influence you to be
40:23
somebody you're not
40:25
he wanted me up here he picked me out of
40:28
all the tribe of my family
40:33
i'm happy that he did
40:37
and i'm happy he put me in america
40:40
and i'm happy that our country
40:42
represents and stands for god
40:47
one nation under god
40:53
and and the father would talk to me all
40:55
the time ever since the elections right
40:57
before the elections the first time he
40:58
said i'm going to throw you out there so
40:59
far you'll never be able to go back
41:02
like go back where
41:06
i knew the the media would all act up
41:08
and you are so right he keeps telling me
41:10
that they'll lose their
41:11
many of them are going to lose their
41:12
networks just so you know that right now
41:15
and other networks will rise up that
41:16
will tell the truth
41:18
amen
41:23
and they'll give us the true news the
41:25
right
41:26
not the hidden the stuff you know not
41:28
not hiding things but letting us know
41:32
i travel overseas a lot and during this
41:34
whole first election that they had
41:36
i got talked to i mean strangers come up
41:38
to me and go you must be an american it
41:40
must be the pink hair
41:42
and we want to know what you think about
41:44
your president oh we in america
41:46
love our president don't watch
41:49
the fake news whatever you do because
41:51
they won't tell you the truth about
41:52
anything
41:54
and this is even like three years into
41:56
his term
41:57
and they went you know what they still
41:59
they have a problem they can't let go of
42:01
what they first started with which is
42:03
the bashing and the accusing
42:04
they said they don't actually give the
42:06
news
42:07
you find out almost nothing about what's
42:10
important
42:11
you keep hearing it's like they put it
42:13
on repeat all the time they're just
42:14
doing the same thing you know why
42:16
they've convinced their own soul
42:19
that stuff is true and when you get in
42:22
your soul you'll choose again
42:25
what you choose to do or say you'll
42:26
choose it again
42:28
that's what happens that's why people
42:31
who listen to it have changed
42:33
people who are nice and kind now are not
42:36
because they've
42:37
compromised their soul
42:40
and so the more people go and say oh no
42:42
you need to listen to what they're
42:43
saying
42:44
they're talking what's right i'm talking
42:46
about the what the people are saying
42:47
that haven't made any decisions
42:50
and there's still some who don't want
42:51
anybody because they don't like anything
42:53
they're hearing
42:55
you choose life
42:58
you always choose life
43:01
no matter who you vote for you choose
43:03
life amen god said this day i offer you
43:05
life and death what does he say
43:10
and so they've been hiding so actually
43:12
their whole mess has gotten worse
43:14
i'm talking about the news media still
43:16
out there it's important to know what's
43:18
going on
43:20
right we need to know news
43:23
good news correct news unbiased news
43:28
and he's going to raise up several
43:30
people i know for sure several
43:32
christians
43:32
that will have their own and first class
43:35
first-rate
43:36
network it's nice to have a show
43:41
it's nice to have a show somewhere but
43:42
he wants a network
43:45
that can replace the false networks that
43:47
are out there
43:50
and i can tell you right now there is
43:52
great fear
43:53
in the camp of the left and there's
43:55
great fear
43:56
they may not say it but they're great
43:58
they're terribly they're awfully afraid
43:59
some are already hiding
44:01
they're afraid in the news media they're
44:03
afraid you may see some people shortly
44:05
leave their
44:06
leave leave that to get out before
44:08
they're taken to prison
44:11
you cannot commit a federal crime and
44:13
not go to prison
44:16
a lot of people in the post office that
44:18
were paid to change ballots add ballots
44:20
steal ballots and
44:22
and that's why i always tell people
44:23
don't mail it in i always said never
44:25
mail it in don't mail it in it's too
44:27
easy for people to take
44:29
and i know there's two point some
44:30
million votes that were actually
44:32
taken away uh and even then
44:35
you know our president still he still
44:37
won even that
44:39
and there were created new ballasts that
44:41
were fed into the thing when they were
44:43
supposed to stop
44:44
counting and close down they weren't and
44:46
i was watching kenneth copeland also
44:48
that night i was
44:49
seeing you and he said okay we're just
44:51
going to go for the evening
44:52
and then they announced we're going to
44:54
stop counting the ballots
44:56
and the holy spirit said yes that's so
44:57
they can feed all the false ones in
45:00
he said this is when they're going to do
45:02
that this is the holy spirit saying
45:03
they're going to do the big switch this
45:04
is on the 3rd of november
45:06
and they're going to they're going to do
45:07
corruption and fraud
45:09
they're going to create brand new
45:10
ballots and replace the ones that
45:12
they've even harvested people's names
45:15
off of ballots and change those ballasts
45:17
and then
45:18
put those into the electoral machines
45:20
that's what they did
45:23
they caught people in illinois that were
45:26
throwing
45:27
trump's ballots by the bins into the
45:30
river
45:32
they were up they were arrested in time
45:33
because of course they were doing it
45:35
but it was filmed and people saw and
45:37
they threw them in the river
45:38
the thing about crime if you're going to
45:41
do
45:42
if you're going to do a scam or whatever
45:44
you want to call it if you're going to
45:45
commit
45:46
fraud on a large scale you don't have
45:48
teams of thousands of people with you
45:51
so you hire whoever's willing to do it
45:54
but when you hire these small time
45:56
criminals
45:58
guess who's going to yell first
46:03
they have no bond with those people
46:06
we are bonded by our love for god and
46:09
our love for our present we have a bond
46:12
and the one thing they weren't counting
46:14
on was that we weren't going to go along
46:17
with their scam
46:20
you can't convince people who know the
46:22
truth
46:23
to accept fraud you just can't convince
46:26
them and i mean he had these rallies
46:29
with forty thousand fifty thousand
46:30
people in it and i've never seen any
46:32
would buy these people
46:37
so where did all these millions of votes
46:40
come from
46:41
that he had no people to vote for him
46:46
i don't know why they don't think well i
46:48
think they're dumb maybe i don't know
46:51
they think we are but the one thing they
46:54
didn't count on
46:56
was the moral majority in this country
46:59
the moral majority they don't want
47:01
socialism
47:02
they don't want their rights taken away
47:04
they don't want to be controlled or
47:06
hand-fed
47:07
okay they don't want to become a
47:08
third-world country they have families
47:11
they have a future they want a destiny
47:14
for their own
47:15
children that's the moral majority and a
47:18
lot of those are believers but some even
47:20
aren't but they still want that kind of
47:22
life
47:22
they're not settling
47:26
and they could put those million dollar
47:28
ads on all day long
47:30
the only ones watching them the ones who
47:31
made them
47:34
it isn't changing us
47:37
and there are people who are blowing
47:39
whistles even in higher places and
47:41
they're very much afraid
47:43
but they can't they can't lose face
47:45
right now they got to keep
47:46
their momentum not with us they got to
47:49
keep their own momentum going for the
47:51
lie
47:52
they know they they know they stole it
47:55
they know they cheated they know that
47:56
they committed crimes
47:57
but they can't cave in
48:00
but there's a lot of ones under them
48:02
that don't want to take the fall
48:06
so on november the 4th god had said to
48:08
me
48:09
when the ground begins to shake
48:13
and at this time they were still doing
48:14
all the false stuff when the ground
48:16
begins to shake
48:17
you watch for the landslide
48:20
the landslide that will go cover from
48:23
the top to the bottom
48:24
when a landslide starts it starts with a
48:28
little shaking
48:30
and as that momentum builds with that
48:33
landslide
48:34
it gets louder and louder and more and
48:36
more
48:37
is pulled into that landslide until the
48:40
whole mountain has been uncovered
48:42
and god said that will be the crime the
48:44
corruption
48:46
all of the stuff the lying the cheating
48:48
the stealing it will all be made known
48:50
and even though they won't want to
48:52
report it can you get over that
48:54
they won't want to report it they cannot
48:56
stop
48:58
president trump from being announced as
49:01
the president
49:02
amen
49:06
he said it will start it will start with
49:08
one phone call and after that one call
49:10
is made and known
49:11
everyone else will be getting in line to
49:14
rat
49:15
on that whole group and even though it's
49:18
happening
49:19
they well they're it's like i think
49:21
they're in the fantasy they
49:23
think if they keep waiting long enough
49:25
they'll convince us to change our minds
49:26
and just drop the whole thing
49:29
now we're not giving our life away
49:32
we're not giving our destiny away we're
49:34
not selling our family down the river
49:37
we are here for the purpose that god put
49:40
us here for
49:41
and we are not to be controlled amen
49:46
and i don't know how long it take to get
49:47
into their heads
49:49
the other thing legally in the natural
49:52
you can't
49:53
call the presidency until all the votes
49:56
are counted
49:58
and i don't know if you know this
49:59
they're now recounting new york
50:03
they're even recounting the recounting
50:05
they're going to get to the thing where
50:06
they can recount all the states they
50:08
think that need to be recounted
50:09
they can't call the election there has
50:11
been nobody called
50:13
who has become president the media is
50:16
just making it up
50:18
hoping we'll believe it
50:23
i'm not believing that
50:27
that's not god's plan and that is not
50:31
what will happen we don't have to settle
50:33
in our lives right
50:35
millions of people i want you know this
50:37
have prayed around the world
50:39
who aren't even americans
50:41
[Applause]
50:44
because they don't want america to
50:46
become a third-world country
50:47
we stand for justice liberty and freedom
50:52
and we help many other countries and
50:54
have and still will
50:56
they don't want to see us they don't
50:58
want to see us fail
51:01
and even they don't believe the lie and
51:04
they don't even live here
51:08
just with statistics and proof it's
51:11
called proof people
51:13
even with the proof that all these
51:15
millions of people are following and
51:17
supporting trump
51:18
they still had a plan they already
51:21
planned this they had this plan before
51:22
he even started running again
51:24
they knew how they would steal it they
51:26
knew that they could do it they knew
51:28
there was a way to do it
51:29
they knew they could pull it off they
51:30
knew if the media would be on their side
51:32
that that's all what everybody would
51:34
believe
51:36
but they didn't and so i wanna
51:39
i wanna encourage people don't
51:42
talk about losing
51:49
you don't talk about losing when god is
51:52
still working his plan
51:56
why we have already won
52:01
we have already won we won because we
52:04
voted we won because we prayed we won
52:06
because it was god's plan
52:09
and all that is needed in the natural
52:11
realm
52:12
has already happened for president trump
52:14
to keep his
52:15
seat amen
52:19
and and god a god god who knows
52:22
everything of course
52:23
he told me because i'll just be walking
52:25
around all of a sudden he'll just
52:26
start talking to me when i say god i
52:28
mean the father
52:30
yes i hear jesus all the time people
52:32
find the craziest things to say about
52:33
you
52:34
one thing you don't even know jesus you
52:36
don't mention him oh yes he is my first
52:38
love and i talk about him all the time
52:39
you must not be listening to the right
52:40
videos
52:43
i have nothing without him i am nothing
52:46
without him
52:47
i'd have no future i would have nothing
52:53
but i do have him and i know him well
52:58
i know what happened to him on the cross
52:59
i know what happened to him in the
53:00
garden i know what happened to him in
53:02
hell
53:02
i know what happened to him when he went
53:04
back to heaven and poured out his blood
53:05
on the mercy seat
53:06
i know what was happening in hell when
53:08
he was pouring his blood out in the
53:09
mercy seat
53:10
the loser was in hell groveling in the
53:14
dirt
53:15
of hell stripped of all his gemstones
53:19
broken and beaten by the son of god
53:22
and no longer had the keys to hell death
53:25
and the grave
53:27
so he took his beauty
53:30
and he took his authority away from him
53:35
that gave us absolutely the right to
53:38
operate in authority in this world
53:42
satan is a false king he's not even a
53:44
king he's a false prince
53:46
a false one who never was given
53:48
authority or the right to do anything
53:52
he took what he wanted and used it while
53:54
he can and that
53:55
side no matter what name you give them
53:57
that does the same thing as all
53:59
the same thing is always what satan
54:01
wants he wants it his own way he wants
54:03
people to worship him he wants him to
54:05
only
54:05
exist with him and that's what happens
54:08
no matter what you put name or tag you
54:10
put on that
54:12
that is satan's plan is to
54:15
kill steal and destroy every person and
54:18
everything
54:20
that's why he is afraid of america
54:24
satan hates america because it causes
54:27
them more
54:28
problems than any other country because
54:30
we preach the gospel from here we train
54:33
people and send them with the gospel
54:35
we go over there and help people learn
54:36
how to give the gospel
54:38
we feed people everywhere we're doing
54:40
kind acts we care about people we rescue
54:43
people for him
54:45
if you were the enemy you wouldn't want
54:47
any of that so what is your plan i'm
54:48
going to take over
54:51
i will deceive them this thing's going
54:52
to stop i can't take it anymore
54:54
it's not working with my plan i'm going
54:56
to take over this country i'm taking it
54:58
for myself
54:59
there's enough wicked people here i can
55:01
already get to use to do that
55:02
but what he didn't count on
55:06
was we have the truth living in us
55:10
it's not something we hear is something
55:12
that lives with us
55:14
and the one who brings the truth lives
55:16
in us
55:17
why would he think we would believe a
55:20
lie
55:22
[Applause]
55:26
you need help if you want to believe a
55:29
lie
55:31
we'll have deliverance right now
55:36
you walk in the truth you live the truth
55:41
you breathe it you speak it
55:44
he came to set us
55:47
free
55:48
[Applause]
55:55
justice is on one of the steps of his
55:58
throne
55:59
huge words justice yes he wants
56:03
justice yes he wants accountability
56:06
yes he wants people to pay for the
56:08
things they have done wrong
56:11
but those who are at the top that lead
56:13
others into it
56:14
are in even more trouble with god
56:18
when you deceive others to join you and
56:20
twist
56:21
the truth and ruin their future and
56:24
ruin their destiny and so many have been
56:27
brought into that place right now
56:29
and i always encourage them if you're
56:31
listening go
56:32
tell the truth while you still can
56:39
go repent and they'll cur turn them in
56:43
tell the truth about the crimes that
56:44
were committed
56:47
and i have sent the host on a daily
56:49
basis
56:51
to encourage people who committed those
56:53
crimes to tell the truth
56:56
do it now while you can don't wait till
56:59
it's too late you'll go to prison
57:03
you know satan tells people things all
57:05
the time do you know the spirit of god
57:07
does too
57:10
he can speak to people to inspire them
57:12
to encourage them
57:13
and heaven wants us to remain free
57:18
because he has god has a plan i'm
57:21
telling you for
57:21
24 years in the white house he's not
57:24
willing
57:25
to tell trump oh you can wait four years
57:28
and then i'll put you in then
57:31
can you imagine the one who made
57:33
everything
57:34
holds the air you breathe no
57:37
has been from the beginning then they've
57:39
been could you ever see him oh i guess
57:41
i'll have to change
57:41
my plan
57:45
we don't understand his ways but we need
57:48
to
57:52
everything that's happening is to set us
57:54
up for the next 100 years
57:57
the inventions that are waiting they're
57:59
just beyond your imagination
58:01
that god's gonna send to this earth to
58:03
help people
58:04
and make their life better
58:08
cancer will be here no more i really
58:11
believe they already have a cure they
58:12
just don't want you to know it
58:14
there'll come a time as this
58:16
administration
58:17
trumps administration and then pence is
58:20
after that for eight years and then
58:26
i i live prophecy i live it
58:29
and he doesn't just show me a few years
58:33
i clearly know what will happen for the
58:35
next 50 years
58:37
clearly have seen it and been there
58:43
god's not changing his mind in his
58:46
master plan
58:47
for america he needs who he
58:51
chose in that office when he chose him
58:55
to be there
58:56
and he is not willing to let the enemy
58:59
have
59:00
those times
59:07
some of the greatest leaders in the body
59:09
of christ are still being born
59:15
who is throwing mountains into the sea
59:18
who's walking on air are raising the
59:20
dead that were cremated
59:23
who's stopping an earthquake and make it
59:25
go back the way it was before it came
59:27
including the dead being raised
59:30
and the buildings going back together
59:33
that's the greater works
59:38
why would he all of a sudden decide
59:41
i just don't want this his son
59:44
died so he could have that happen
59:47
the death of his son and resurrection of
59:49
his son was so these things could happen
59:52
in this world that he created so they
59:55
could happen and people would know there
59:57
is a god
60:02
he told me he was erasing the gray area
60:04
that existed in america what's the gray
60:06
area
60:07
the one saying there is no god
60:11
that is getting smaller and smaller
60:13
there come a point where people know
60:15
i'm either in the darkness or i'm in the
60:16
light there's there's no hiding there's
60:18
no wondering
60:19
you know who people believe and what
60:22
they live they'll either live in regions
60:24
of darkness
60:27
and it will be legal and they'll be
60:29
living in regions of light
60:31
the great light the greater light
60:34
regions and cities sometimes more than
60:36
one city
60:37
and people will drive their dead family
60:39
members in there and they'll come to
60:40
life that's how powerful
60:42
the presence of god will be the
60:44
authority of the believer will be great
60:46
in these regions of light sickness can't
60:49
abide no crime
60:51
i saw demons flee like dust out of these
60:54
cities to get out because it was
60:56
painful for them the annoying king that
61:00
was put in you when you were born again
61:01
is painful to the enemy
61:04
what anointing the anointing that breaks
61:07
the yoke
61:10
you have it first john 2
61:13
27 there's a scripture for all you who
61:15
want that
61:17
it's in the bible
61:22
i have a little cd i made and we made it
61:26
in this very old church because the
61:27
pastor thomas
61:29
he gave himself up and ran from a
61:31
denominational church they
61:33
tried to steal his church in mississippi
61:36
in the heart of mississippi in this
61:39
little tiny town
61:40
it says little town where big things
61:42
happen and it's one little pastor stood
61:44
up to all the other
61:46
religious people trying to shut him up
61:47
and didn't want him speaking about
61:49
certain things and
61:50
so finally they said in in two weeks
61:52
you'll be out of here and he stood up in
61:53
the church and
61:54
he was the pastor and he said okay i'm
61:56
leaving now whoever would like to follow
61:58
me and have life and have holy spirit
62:00
just come they all left with him
62:05
i think he had four elders left
62:10
and he started this church it was never
62:12
got really huge but man the
62:13
impact it had on that whole little town
62:16
and he found out about me
62:17
i think i went to his place like eight
62:19
times in like two years
62:21
and they ended up by getting people
62:22
together and they trained them and
62:24
trained them in the host and they ran
62:25
witchcraft out of town
62:28
they ran it out i mean you talk about
62:29
manifestations they
62:31
they had them everybody was afraid of
62:33
the witches
62:34
and uh god said when you go this time
62:36
witchcraft will be run out they will run
62:37
it out
62:39
and when we were leaving down when
62:41
margaret and i were leaving
62:43
we had pictures in the sky
62:48
of a witch leaving town
62:53
leaving town those people are so
62:54
determined we want to be free from the
62:56
effect and the control
62:58
witchcraft is not a joke
63:02
don't watch it
63:06
don't watch it don't read it
63:10
it's all about controlling people that's
63:12
what they're for
63:15
it's not a joke one of the things coming
63:19
one day because you know whenever god
63:20
does some great things the enemy brings
63:22
in a counterfeit
63:24
right well people will begin to know
63:26
okay well i can't believe this lie
63:27
anymore it's too obvious that god is
63:29
here
63:30
it's going to get more and more obvious
63:31
that there is a god his name is jesus
63:33
christ
63:34
and so it will be hard for the devil to
63:36
come up with new things but one of the
63:37
things he will have
63:38
at that time will be good witchcraft
63:42
because all the movies are preparing
63:43
people for him
63:45
oh in front of people they'll raise the
63:47
dead and heal the sick and say you can
63:49
still be a witch
63:51
see this thing is coming we have to be
63:54
powerful we have to be strong
63:56
we have to be fierce we have to
63:58
understand uh it says in all your
64:00
getting of wisdom get
64:01
understanding that is knowledge of the
64:03
holy one
64:04
and how he operates that's why these
64:07
days
64:08
have to come they have to have
64:11
manifestations of the power
64:13
and the passion and the plans of the
64:15
living god
64:18
because that is the one thing we can
64:20
come against it with
64:22
because there will be a lot of
64:23
impressionable people think oh this is a
64:25
good thing they have not
64:26
one ounce of discernment in their being
64:30
because they've been fed it by movies
64:34
and books oh there are good witches
64:37
they're
64:37
against the bad ones there are no good
64:40
witches
64:46
and they've been around for a long time
64:50
and the bible says have nothing to do
64:52
with a necromancer
64:54
go look it up
64:58
there were never any good ones in the
64:59
old testament there were never any good
65:01
ones in the new testament and there are
65:02
no good ones now
65:05
don't consult a medium or a psychic
65:08
you're getting this for free don't
65:10
consult them if you did
65:11
lose it from your song repent for it
65:15
they don't work for god
65:19
he's fivefold ministry his prophets
65:22
or prophetic people anyone can prophesy
65:27
make sure you're accountable in your
65:28
life and your actions right and you know
65:30
how you get more you step out and do it
65:33
you step out god gives you word if he's
65:35
like you're going to explode and burn
65:36
inside
65:38
you need to say that you're also not
65:40
accountable for forcing that person to
65:42
do it
65:43
i'll save you some grief if you deliver
65:45
a word from god it's not your job to
65:47
make them do it
65:49
you're going to start a whole different
65:51
war
65:53
you deliver it let the holy spirit work
65:56
on them
65:57
not your job
66:02
and the hardest people to prophesy to
66:04
are your family
66:08
my family still wants to know what's for
66:10
dinner when laundry's gonna be done
66:14
even though they have they have all this
66:16
revelation
66:19
he knows how to keep you humble give
66:22
your family
66:22
[Laughter]
66:26
and even if i go too long let me know i
66:28
just
66:30
gotta talk about jesus
66:33
bless the lord jesus christ and all that
66:36
he's done
66:37
more than any of us all put together
66:39
he's been through it all
66:43
he really has the hardest part was the
66:47
garden
66:47
not the cross he died before he got
66:50
there
66:52
he died to the father's will
66:56
if it be possible let this cup pass from
66:59
me
67:01
because what was in the cup wasn't in
67:03
him
67:04
it wasn't anything he ever would do or
67:06
want to do
67:07
but what had to be nailed to the cross
67:09
was what was in the cup
67:12
that's the only person who can forgive
67:14
our sins is him
67:15
he's the only one that drank all that
67:17
sin in
67:18
and nailed it to the cross no one else
67:21
can say they can forgive sins
67:23
no other religion no other god none of
67:26
them
67:28
in the garden was the most important
67:30
thing he did
67:32
when he said but not my will
67:35
let your will be done and two angels
67:39
were sent from heaven
67:41
i got to talk about this cup when jesus
67:44
when he was on the earth and it would
67:46
say
67:46
even when he had his disciples
67:47
especially after he got the disciples
67:50
he'd go away to the mountain to be with
67:51
his father
67:54
he'd go see him he'd meet him and talk
67:56
to him
67:57
and he went there and he took him a cup
68:01
god his father made him a carpenter
68:04
he put business in his son so he would
68:07
have a door to speak to anybody anywhere
68:11
that's why he likes business people you
68:14
get more invitations if your business
68:16
right and so i also opened a door for
68:19
him to talk with sinners all the time
68:20
they wanted him to do he was a master
68:22
carpenter not just a finish not just a
68:24
little finish she was a master carpenter
68:26
joseph was a master carpenter so he made
68:29
on purpose
68:30
for his father he made this cup
68:34
it wasn't really beautiful it was wood
68:36
of course
68:37
very perfect mastery the way he made it
68:40
in the handle was
68:40
beautiful and so he met with him and
68:43
gave it to him
68:44
this is about his um second year into
68:47
his ministry
68:49
so when the father had to choose he
68:51
already knew this would all happen
68:53
he had to choose a cup to put all that
68:56
in
68:56
and he knew his son would have to drink
68:58
it or the plan wouldn't work
69:01
the plan was to for him to die for our
69:04
sins that we might be free that we would
69:06
have a way back to the father
69:08
so the father got that cup and he put
69:10
all that stuff in it
69:11
he chose two angels
69:14
from a gabriel's group because gabriel
69:16
angels look more like humans with wings
69:18
most of the army look like creatures
69:23
i mean some have eight eyes
69:26
some have weapons coming out of them
69:29
they're an army
69:31
so he picked two of gabriel's that
69:34
already the lord knew who these angels
69:36
were he knew them he knew them when he
69:38
was in heaven
69:39
and they brought that cup to him and
69:41
they were in the garden
69:42
the whole time and ministered to him
69:44
while he was having to drink this cup
69:48
but as part of their reward god does
69:51
reward
69:53
as part of the reward for willing to do
69:55
that it would be very hard because they
69:56
couldn't come against anybody there who
69:58
was coming to take him
70:00
the army actually probably had the
70:02
hardest time because he was the lord of
70:04
hosts
70:05
the army of heaven he was over all the
70:06
armies of heaven christ was
70:09
and and they loved him and so it was
70:12
probably very hard they were all told in
70:14
heaven this was going to happen they
70:15
knew it
70:16
so they didn't come down and beat up
70:17
people or rip up the people that were
70:18
going to try to crucify him
70:20
i'm sure they wanted to do that because
70:23
to defend to protect him would have been
70:24
their number one thing
70:25
when christ came and was sent down to
70:28
earth and
70:28
made into a little seed and planted in
70:30
the womb of mary
70:32
they already knew they couldn't go down
70:33
there and fight for him
70:36
if you remember what he said before the
70:37
sanhedrin court
70:39
if i wanted to do you remember he said
70:42
that
70:43
if i wanted to he was letting them know
70:46
i'm not
70:47
i'm not who you really think i am i have
70:49
the ability to do these things i lay
70:51
down my life but if i wanted to
70:53
i could call the army of heaven these
70:56
creatures are like 150 200 feet high
70:58
they have eyes where you wouldn't even
71:00
think guys would be
71:01
they have spears coming out that shred
71:03
the enemy when they spin
71:06
the the in satan's army they they have
71:08
all kinds of weapons they turn into
71:10
missiles and go to where the battle is
71:11
and they come back to be their self and
71:13
then they go in there and attack
71:15
he could have called them
71:19
to fight for him if he had said even one
71:21
word they would have come
71:23
but he knew he had to die
71:27
so these two angels were in the garden
71:29
with him their reward was
71:31
they also were chosen to be in the tomb
71:33
with him
71:34
and they were the first ones to see him
71:37
when he came back up from health
71:41
i was recently in israel they're still
71:43
outside the tomb they still protect it's
71:45
a holy place
71:46
they're still there they're on
71:48
assignment
71:50
they were the first ones who got to see
71:52
him they're also the ones that talked to
71:53
the disciples they talked to mary
71:55
and they said why are you looking for
71:57
the why are you looking for him
71:59
he's not dead those two same angels were
72:02
the ones who were in the garden with him
72:03
with a cup so god does give rewards
72:07
angels get rewards for completing what
72:10
they were sent for
72:11
now in this time they are
72:14
millions of them have been sent to fight
72:16
on our behalf
72:18
we have the right to command them
72:20
because they were made
72:22
like a military and you can't go to an
72:25
army a natural army and say
72:27
would you mind please going over here
72:29
and doing that
72:32
could you imagine standing before hope
72:34
or gay going to ship them out somewhere
72:36
would you mind would it bother you uh
72:39
please i have a request would you mind
72:40
going over that they would look at you
72:42
like you were nuts
72:43
the army of heaven is the same way
72:46
they need orders from headquarters
72:50
well headquarters is here because the
72:52
lord of hosts lives
72:54
in us
73:00
and they have been very very busy over
73:04
these last
73:05
few months and even more so
73:08
now to make sure every single thing gets
73:11
exposed
73:13
they know where everything is
73:16
nothing is hidden from god he knows
73:18
where every stolen ballot is
73:20
he knows where every every machine it
73:22
was messed with or tampered with or
73:23
changed or whatever
73:24
he knows the name of every person who
73:26
participated
73:29
he is not clueless
73:32
and he meant it when he said the
73:34
exposure will be great
73:36
so he said i said well what do you want
73:38
me to do now i mean i i pray every night
73:40
i'm not
73:41
i call it prayer communication
73:44
i talk to god if i have a request i
73:48
spend another time
73:50
just getting to know him i would just
73:52
spend time talking to him like he was
73:54
right here because he is
73:57
and one day he walked through the wall
73:58
of my home now he walks through the wall
74:00
of my home all the time
74:03
but they need you need to give them
74:05
commands
74:07
they can't take a written prayer request
74:09
okay they can't do that
74:13
back in the day even in the old
74:14
testament i think it's in isaiah
74:16
it said that the israel was under a
74:19
siege for something i remember what it
74:20
was
74:21
and it said the captain of the host
74:23
that's michael
74:25
went to the far ends of heaven and
74:27
gathered the army of heaven to come and
74:28
fight on behalf of israel
74:31
so that's the way it normally was done
74:33
until 2014
74:37
there was already a major shift into our
74:40
authority and dominion
74:42
and i can tell you this the army of
74:43
heaven cannot they cannot finish the
74:46
whole purpose he made them
74:47
if we do not do this they were always
74:51
designed to fight
74:52
for us amen
74:58
i just want to assure you that trump i
75:01
hear my
75:02
in my ears all the time trump's winning
75:04
trump's winning
75:05
he's sitting in the white house he's
75:06
going to sit in that white house he's
75:07
not going to be evicted
75:11
he will sit there and you'll begin even
75:13
more and more to see him
75:14
bring pension on different things
75:17
because he'll be preparing him
75:21
he will be preparing him to be president
75:23
after him
75:24
how do i know god said so
75:27
i say what god says and i show you
75:31
things that he
75:31
showed me and he will sit in that white
75:35
house
75:36
and to me it doesn't matter what date
75:38
they give that
75:39
it is happening it's happening i've even
75:42
already received a
75:44
request to come and do um to pray for
75:47
the president vice president at the
75:48
inaugural prayer breakfast because guess
75:50
what they're carrying on with their
75:51
plans too
75:54
[Applause]
75:57
they're preparing like none of this ever
76:01
happened
76:03
they're already scheduling events for
76:04
the inauguration
76:06
making plans hiring companies to do
76:09
things
76:11
because they know the truth
76:16
is everybody stand up for just a minute
76:23
you don't have to wonder if you've ever
76:24
been chosen if you're alive this is what
76:26
caused it if you're alive and breathing
76:28
you're chosen
76:31
if you remember the body of christ you
76:33
have greatness written all over you
76:37
god's plans have already been written
76:40
about you
76:42
and god said these days that we're
76:44
living now
76:45
will be sung about in heaven in eternity
76:50
this so this is not just another time
76:54
on the earth this is an event on god's
76:57
timeline
76:58
it doesn't count time like we do it's
77:01
all about
77:02
events and this is an event in heaven
77:07
part of the divine decade that we'll be
77:09
living in
77:11
and the things you'll get to do people
77:13
have never even seen or heard of on the
77:15
earth before
77:18
because you're chosen
77:21
nobody can tell you you're not i'm
77:23
telling you you are chosen
77:26
how do i know you're here
77:30
if he times your birth on the earth and
77:33
you are here you are chosen
77:36
chosen to be great for him chosen to
77:39
manifest the power
77:41
of the living god
77:45
it is a great thing to be a manifested
77:47
son or daughter
77:49
he trusts you you don't have to have a
77:52
real high education it's not about how
77:54
smart you are
77:54
it's about how willing
77:58
pray that my people be willing in the
78:00
day of my power
78:05
those who are willing and obedient shall
78:06
eat the fat of the
78:09
i know the word i don't carry a bible
78:13
it's in here we were taught
78:17
to read the word of god and know the
78:19
word of god we were taught to pray
78:21
before we could even speak we had family
78:24
altar
78:28
but it didn't make me not want god it
78:31
made me want him more
78:34
he loves every person in every
78:38
country no matter where they are right
78:40
now no matter who they are
78:42
no matter what they're doing
78:45
he still wants them
78:48
so if he doesn't have us if he doesn't
78:52
have the light
78:54
in the spirit realm you have light
78:56
coming from you some people have great
78:58
light some people have light
79:00
some people have darkness in them
79:02
[Music]
79:05
so i always know who knows the lord and
79:08
he doesn't know the lord
79:12
if there's any way possible now these
79:15
people have to shake their hand they
79:16
don't know they don't want me hugging
79:17
well some might want to
79:18
hang them it's so important
79:22
to learn to release the anointing
79:25
if you don't if you don't do that why
79:26
did he put it in you to release it
79:29
[Music]
79:30
you only got to deposit
79:32
[Music]
79:33
it says in first john 2 27 when you
79:35
receive jesus christ as your savior
79:38
you receive a deposit of the anointing
79:43
what anointing the anointing breaks the
79:46
yoke
79:47
that's what it is the more you release
79:49
it
79:50
the more it grows that was not peter's
79:53
personal
79:53
shadow that healed people it was the
79:56
cloud of anointing
79:58
because he released so much it builds a
80:00
cloud sometimes you can walk in the room
80:02
and it fills the whole room
80:04
that's any believer any believer
80:08
you have it in you it's a deposit
80:12
so the more you give it out the more you
80:14
get back
80:16
and it never stops it just grows and
80:18
grows and
80:19
one day you feel yourself when you go i
80:21
release the anointing you actually feel
80:23
it it looks like blue fire
80:26
shooting out of you so everybody put
80:28
your hand here we're gonna stir it up
80:32
say father i choose as an act of my will
80:38
as a believer in jesus christ
80:42
to release the anointing so stir it up
80:48
okay now i want you to lay hands on
80:49
somebody next to you and i want you to
80:52
say
80:52
with everything within you and you say
80:54
this and you wait until i say
80:56
i can feel i can feel leaving you i want
80:59
you to open your hand the person say i
81:00

81:01
the anointing in jesus name
81:06
i want you to see i can already feel it
81:08
i want you to picture it
81:10
leaving right here and it goes up your
81:12
arm like blue fire
81:14
written out of your arm so if i walk
81:16
here
81:18
like i can feel it coming from all of
81:22
you
81:23
it's like up here it swirls like a river
81:26
the fire does everywhere
81:32
i've been i feel it like waves hitting
81:34
me right now
81:36
it's very powerful i want you to say
81:40
thank you jesus
81:42
for giving me the anointing
81:46
encourage me every day
81:50
to use it wherever i go
81:54
amen okay y'all stop
81:58
[Music]
82:00
[Applause]
82:03
when i sit in a restaurant i always put
82:05
my hand on the table and just say
82:07
i release the anointing and i will see
82:10
blue fire
82:11
come out of my hand and coat that whole
82:13
table it will never
82:15
wash off it will never wear off
82:18
whoever sits at that table will get the
82:22
anointing on them i do the same thing to
82:24
the glasses to the silverware
82:26
when you go through a door if you touch
82:28
the door release the anointing when you
82:30
slide your card release the anointing
82:32
everyone who slides their card in that
82:34
thing will get the anointing on them
82:38
before you send a text get it typed out
82:40
let your hand say release the anointing
82:42
when they open it the anointing will get
82:43
on them
82:44
[Music]
82:47
it is transferable
82:50
there's no excuse not to do it it is
82:54
free
82:58
you will begin really i'm not kidding
83:00
you'll sit in the seat and get up and
83:01
someone sits and they'll feel the
83:02
anointing
83:04
i can sit and people people's seats like
83:06
when we used to do i used to do
83:07
hospitality of our church of 5000.
83:10
we would do the feed the board every
83:13
once a year it would be like jesse and
83:15
all kinds i can't remember other names
83:17
right now but powerful men
83:19
and women of god and they get up and
83:21
leave i wouldn't be in there when they
83:22
were eating i go sit in everybody's
83:23
chair i knew who it was i always knew
83:25
jesse i'd start laughing
83:28
whoever was i i could feel it
83:31
it's like light electricity on you
83:36
if you want to have encounters
83:40
if you want to feel the power of god
83:44
it is in you
83:47
it's already in you when you got saved
83:51
he put it there
83:53
you release it you can put on clothing
83:55
like i prayed over their mantles
83:57
like i release the anointing every chair
84:00
in your office including your desk now
84:02
has the anointing in it
84:04
it doesn't matter where you go the more
84:06
you do it the more will come out
84:08
and you do that one day you'll be
84:09
shocked and you'll feel it leaving you
84:12
so when peter would walk past people we
84:14
did it so much the cloud of the
84:15
anointing
84:16
like far exceeded him and when they said
84:19
his shadow touched him they were healed
84:21
and demons came out
84:22
it was the anointing that breaks the
84:24
yoke that you
84:25
have don't ever forget this
84:30
you have a weapon from heaven
84:33
that breaks the yoke of darkness
84:36
put in every gift you give every gift
84:40
you give release
84:41
into the gift if you give something away
84:43
people release it if you give food to
84:44
people release it
84:46
don't ever stop doing that one day
84:49
you walk into a place and people will
84:52
fall out from the anointing
84:54
the glory you create glory for god but
84:57
you also carry the glory
84:59
how do i know christ in you
85:02
do you know what that means that's
85:06
something that's deposited in you too
85:09
the glory at one point will begin to be
85:12
released from you it looks like
85:14
it looks like shock waves of light the
85:16
glory looks like light the fire looks
85:18
like fire
85:20
it feels like i when i see people
85:22
release it it
85:23
like shock waves i can almost hear it
85:26
and it was somewhere
85:26
speaking somewhere and the holy spirit
85:28
said go back to the products table
85:31
and as i started walk through the proxy
85:32
table people started falling out
85:34
now i talked about the glory in the
85:35
meaning guess what it also makes a
85:38
difference because of your soul
85:41
that when you speak about these things
85:42
it increases in your soul
85:46
you can't hear something and then do
85:47
nothing
85:49
you can't do it heaven doesn't operate
85:51
that way it's your actions
85:53
along with your words if you want to
85:57
rule you have to do something
86:02
who cares what people think
86:06
so i went to the broader table these
86:07
people started falling out and i'm like
86:08
i could feel
86:09
like wow i could hardly i could hardly
86:11
stand up on wow god
86:14
they're really anointed aren't they
86:17
i heard the holy spirit he laughs at me
86:19
a lot
86:20
he was laughing and laughing goes that
86:24
is coming from you because i was looking
86:27
no matter what these people are falling
86:29
down they're
86:29
lining people waiting to get products
86:31
and my son-in-law who's my son-in-law
86:34
just kept right on selling the products
86:36
i'll always decide now just
86:38
do this it was funny because okay okay
86:42
what do i do you said just say already
86:43
used to glory
86:44
and i literally could see light waves go
86:46
like shhh
86:50
and whoever they touched they started
86:52
falling down people got healed people
86:53
got set free and went
86:56
what is this when the bible goes the
86:58
knowledge
87:00
of the glory will cover the earth life
87:02
the waters cover the sea
87:04
he said it will cover them because you
87:06
will be releasing it people will be this
87:08
not just me
87:09
this is for the body of christ christ in
87:13
you
87:13
is the hope of glory the glory being
87:16
released showing up
87:17
impacting people and nations and things
87:20
and places that god wants you to go to
87:23
this is what you get as a believer
87:27
do it in your family's home how do you
87:29
do that you just start doing it
87:30
i release the glory i release the glory
87:34
i release the glory just take time to do
87:36
it pretty soon you can do that one day
87:38
and you'll feel it coming out of you
87:41
if you speak for christ if you share
87:43
with people
87:44
if you read your word it's building in
87:48
you
87:49
let it out let the anointing out let the
87:54
glory out
87:55
fire when the baptism in fire comes it's
87:58
going to be so
87:59
powerful it just burns the world
88:02
out of you it burns any fear you'll
88:04
never be afraid again the boldness that
88:07
rises up in you
88:08
you begin to carry that fire places will
88:11
actually look like they're on fire
88:13
buildings look like they're on fire
88:15
people will see it on you one day
88:17
his eyes were flames of fire
88:20
our god is a consuming fire that is
88:24
spiritual fire
88:26
that will transform you and places and
88:28
people
88:29
because you carry it


Kat Kerr Prophecy (April 20, 2021) 🎤 SPECIAL MESSAGE UPDATE - MUST WATCH
by Sermon For You Apr 20, 2021
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKsMrCIJDRw
or https://youtu.be/KKsMrCIJDRw

00:00
yes we are on right now i believe so
00:04
hello everybody again
00:08
it's always worth waiting for something
00:10
from god isn't it
00:11
and you know we all need extra grace
00:14
here too sometimes
00:15
but i don't know how much you heard or i
00:18
don't know but we're going to start all
00:19
over again so thank you for joining us
00:21
i'm very excited that i get to share um
00:24
revelation from heaven
00:26
you're going to get news bulletins from
00:28
heaven during this time you may even get
00:29
something
00:30
brand new given to me and if it comes
00:32
from heaven i'm going to share it
00:34
but this is the very main purpose for
00:37
these this broadcast today
00:39
is to share what time it actually is on
00:42
god's timeline
00:44
and many people don't know god has a
00:46
timeline of course he does he created
00:48
time
00:49
and there are certain things he will
00:51
make sure
00:52
happen in this earth he made the earth
00:55
he made us he put us here for a purpose
00:57
and so guess what he has worked out this
00:59
whole timeline thing
01:01
even to the very end which by the way no
01:04
matter what people say or think
01:06
or try to calculate or assume
01:10
only one person knows when the end will
01:13
actually come
01:15
that would be the father so even jesus
01:18
knows that right so we're going to flow
01:20
with what the father has figured out for
01:22
this time
01:23
and he does have a plan even while
01:25
you're taking
01:26
a unexpected vacay at home
01:30
and i'm praying all the time for people
01:32
you know and in their situations and how
01:34
this is going to affect them in many
01:36
different ways
01:37
i have been outside at night in the
01:38
street probably for hours
01:41
praying over all of you and i want to
01:44
say
01:44
hi to my friends that would be my pastor
01:46
friends who've invited me to come and
01:48
share
01:48
their place to bring heaven to this
01:51
earth i'm excited that some of you
01:53
actually get to see
01:54
this broadcast and from now on as much
01:56
as we can we're going to give you all a
01:57
heads up
01:58
if you would like to before we go live
02:01
and then
02:02
i'm very happy to be with all of you
02:05
today and very grateful for all that you
02:07
have done
02:08
and paid a price for yourself to allow
02:10
god to invade and
02:12
inhabit your sanctuaries in your meeting
02:14
places
02:15
because you want the more of god and i
02:17
hope everyone out there
02:19
you have had an opportunity to be a part
02:21
of meetings
02:23
that give you revelation that train you
02:26
that they don't just give you a nice
02:27
little message that makes you feel warm
02:29
and fuzzy
02:29
but will make you powerful and dangerous
02:32
against the darkness
02:34
that's why we are here it's the body of
02:36
christ
02:37
that is the audience i'm speaking to
02:38
right now
02:40
to those who have been born again who've
02:42
received jesus christ as your savior
02:44
those are the ones i'm speaking to
02:46
anyone else listening
02:47
you're just going to get blessed anyway
02:49
and by the way i need to let you know
02:50
that my words carry the anointing that
02:52
abides in me
02:54
the anointing that breaks the yoke of
02:56
darkness so if you're out there for
02:57
other purposes or uh you have an agenda
03:00
of your own
03:01
zap bam you with the anointing so that
03:04
when you leave this
03:06
broadcast no matter what you thought you
03:08
came here for
03:09
you will be filled with the anointing
03:11
aren't you excited about that
03:13
we need to learn about these weapons god
03:15
has given us like the anointing i may
03:17
share a little bit about that later
03:19
by the way this is not the only
03:20
broadcast that we'll be making
03:22
during our little vacay at home stay
03:26
whatever we want to call that i don't
03:28
like the word quarantine
03:30
we don't actually have anything ourself
03:32
right now and let me tell you we
03:34
you will learn how to come against
03:37
every spirit of infirmity sickness or
03:40
disease
03:41
before we end because most of the
03:43
questions i get from people are
03:45
what do we do about this can we do
03:47
anything about this you know we're not
03:49
over sickness
03:50
what can we do well they obviously don't
03:52
read the word of god
03:53
because jesus said the things that he
03:55
did
03:56
we will do also in greater works and he
03:59
was
04:00
over sickness he was not under it you
04:02
are over it you are not
04:03
under it you need to start saying that
04:06
yourself don't repeat every
04:07
every doom and gloom thing you hear
04:09
about today or you know this is the end
04:12
we need to get ready to escape on the
04:13
rapture rug
04:15
i can tell you also this is not time for
04:17
your rapture rug roll it up and stick it
04:19
in the closet
04:20
and as you've heard me say before get
04:22
your crown on
04:23
because the word itself says that we are
04:25
kings and priests and to our god
04:28
those are spiritual levels of authority
04:31
and dominion
04:32
that is something powerful christ gave
04:34
us you need to learn to rule
04:37
even in this time even while you're at
04:39
home or wherever you are right now
04:41
you know that you can speak words of
04:43
authority and dominion and
04:45
take that authority and it starts to
04:47
change things
04:48
number one open your front door if
04:50
there's a lot of arguing going on
04:52
if there's strife in your home right now
04:55
open your front door and you evict it
04:56
out right now you don't want to keep
04:58
that stuff in your home
04:59
make sure you're speaking words of hope
05:01
and life and truth to all of your family
05:04
and even to yourself so these are just
05:07
little
05:07
tips maybe the holy spirit may add
05:10
throughout this broadcast because he
05:11
really is
05:12
the director no matter who we think we
05:14
are what we're doing
05:16
the holy spirit is the director of all
05:17
these broadcasts if he wants something
05:20
sad that's not on my little tiny tip
05:22
list here then he's going to say it to
05:25
me and if he says it you're going to
05:26
hear
05:26
it that's one of those news news
05:29
bulletins from heaven
05:31
but our primary purpose today is to
05:34
discuss
05:34
what time it is on god's timeline so
05:37
that you be prepared
05:38
for the future and by the way the main
05:40
thing he wants me to say to you is this
05:42
is a
05:43
temporary situation some people act like
05:46
it is the end of their life and it's
05:49
not this is only temporary it will
05:53
pass like many things that come and go
05:55
on this earth
05:56
this too will pass and hopefully you
06:00
will be stronger and better
06:02
and more understanding of god himself
06:05
and be able
06:06
to ruin reign in your own home learn how
06:08
to crush the darkness and push it back
06:11
so you will be stronger yourself and i
06:13
want to also just
06:14
add this i have called many different
06:16
places where i do business with
06:18
or a frequent and most of them have left
06:21
the nicest
06:23
kindest and encouraging messages on
06:25
their answer machine
06:27
for everyone to hear when you call just
06:28
as an example
06:30
i had to call steinmart because i have
06:33
to know if i can still come in and make
06:34
my little payment
06:35
and guess what they said they said this
06:38
is just a temporary setback we
06:41
will be back and when we come back we'll
06:43
be stronger we can't wait to see you
06:45
again
06:45
that should be your attitude not like
06:48
it's all over oh god what are we gonna
06:50
do now
06:50
do we need to take all of our money out
06:52
of the bank and go hide somewhere in the
06:54
hills with it number one you can't spend
06:56
it in the hills
06:57
and number two i would not do that
06:59
unless god told you to
07:00
you're gonna need that bank account
07:01
you're going to need it to still thrive
07:04
and not just survive on this surge
07:06
you're going to need a place to keep
07:07
your money send your money and spend it
07:09
and so unless he told you that don't run
07:11
to the bank and drain your bank account
07:13
and close everything
07:14
he'll just be going back and reopening
07:16
it later
07:17
this is a temporary situation
07:21
and i do take everything seriously
07:23
people said you should be serious about
07:24
this is really a desperate time
07:26
i would not call this a desperate time i
07:28
would call this god's time
07:30
and i'm going to go along with what god
07:32
says and what god wants
07:33
and i'm going to keep my attitude
07:36
excited
07:37
and expectant because that's what you
07:39
should be if you belong to him he knows
07:41
where you are
07:42
he knows every hair on your head he
07:44
knows every day of your life
07:45
he knows the day your mansion and your
07:47
mention in heaven will be done
07:49
he's already planned your homecoming so
07:52
why not stay excited in your life and
07:54
you
07:54
choose to be happy instead of mad angry
07:58
upset don't let that get into you
08:01
and whatever you do you need to crush
08:02
fear don't let fear rule you
08:05
no fear no interfering of fear in your
08:07
life
08:08
and why i keep saying that because a lot
08:10
of people are also
08:11
i get listen i get text messages from
08:13
people who actually have my number
08:15
i get emails from all over the world i
08:18
get phone messages left on our phones
08:20
which we have
08:21
obviously on our website that anybody
08:23
can call us that wants to
08:25
and so after listening to these or
08:27
looking at these
08:28
over these last few days i understand
08:32
that people
08:32
are in fear they're confused they're in
08:36
fear maybe they've never faced anything
08:38
like this before
08:39
my mom would be sitting right here with
08:41
her plum switch next to me saying hey
08:43
they survived the depression
08:45
this is not the depression it is not a
08:48
plague
08:49
and it isn't a disease it is a virus
08:53
a virus comes and goes it also has a
08:56
time limit
08:57
and why have we chosen the symbol for
08:59
our theme
09:00
that says god's time and it shows an
09:03
hourglass like an
09:04
actual hourglass because the sands of
09:07
time
09:08
in an hourglass have a limit
09:11
and when those sands pass through the
09:13
hourglass
09:14
that time is over well that's exactly
09:17
how we see this whole situation
09:19
it is a temporary time it is a limited
09:22
time in your life
09:24
and i look at this times break in time
09:27
or moment in time that we're in right
09:29
now
09:30
is very special that means i get to
09:32
spend more private time with god i
09:34
actually will get to spend time with my
09:36
family
09:38
now that's exciting for me since i do so
09:40
much traveling
09:42
and i do a lot of broadcast i do a lot
09:44
of other things
09:45
that takes up the time on the earth in
09:47
my life so i'm
09:49
in one in one way i'm very grateful and
09:51
thankful
09:52
that i actually get to spend time with
09:54
my family or maybe even call
09:55
the family members i haven't seen in a
09:57
while i hope you're going to take
09:59
advantage of that
10:00
maybe even make a few notes of wow i can
10:03
spend time doing
10:04
this instead of just being a fearful or
10:07
upset
10:08
or confused get rid of all those things
10:11
in your life right now
10:13
and fill yourself with the life of god
10:15
the plans of god
10:16
his expectancy you can choose with your
10:19
own will
10:21
to take this in one direction or another
10:24
i hope you take it in one that takes you
10:27
up
10:28
and not down in this time god has
10:31
planned on the earth
10:32
he's not changing anything it's not
10:34
going to change his plans
10:35
or what he's going to do just because a
10:37
virus is passing through
10:39
and hopefully will pass out that would
10:41
be i say rather than passing the virus
10:43
just pass out
10:44
and i want to also repeat something
10:46
you're going to things i've heard god
10:47
say to me
10:48
and he this is what he says about this
10:50
whole thing this is not
10:52
a government takeover but it is a
10:55
takedown of the virus so doesn't that
10:58
sound much better than people yelling
11:00
the the government's taking over they're
11:02
going to take everything away we're
11:03
going to have marshall
11:04
uh law is going to come in and we're
11:06
going to be be putting body bags and
11:08
ships somewhere yes we've heard all
11:10
these things given to us
11:11
that is not what god's got planned and
11:14
don't let your mind go in that direction
11:16
okay
11:17
we need to all be in agreement with what
11:19
has been decided
11:20
on for our best our government that is
11:24
in place right now
11:26
number one god chose our leader he's a
11:29
powerful man
11:30
he does love america and he's doing his
11:33
very best to handle this in the best
11:35
way and to think that anybody would even
11:38
consider
11:38
that possibly the country would work
11:40
together to try
11:42
to limit the spread of this uh virus
11:46
and really care about us and he is
11:48
talking about financial help i am not
11:51
um crazy enough to think that that
11:53
doesn't interfere in your life i
11:55
understand
11:56
we have to have money to buy things and
11:58
to get supplies that we need
12:00
and my prayer for all of you out there
12:03
is that god will
12:04
so inspire you feel you so full of him
12:07
make sure you think about others other
12:09
than just yourself because i know right
12:11
now
12:12
some people are kind of isolated with
12:13
themselves but you do remember that
12:16
all the people in this country are also
12:20
experiencing the same thing
12:22
at the same time which is rare okay
12:25
there's people in other countries and
12:27
many of them are my friends
12:28
and i want to say hello to everybody out
12:30
there who's not in america
12:32
yes god cares about you too make sure
12:35
you're speaking
12:36
life and hope and the power of god and
12:38
everything you say if people ask you
12:40
questions about this going on
12:42
say we hope in our god we trust in our
12:45
god
12:46
our god knows and he cares about us and
12:48
he cares about people other people too
12:51
so the way you think and the what you
12:53
say
12:54
makes a huge difference in the
12:56
atmosphere of where you live
12:59
this place i live in right here i call
13:01
it my dwelling place because it's not a
13:03
home it's my office this
13:05
whole entire structure we used to call a
13:07
home is now our
13:09
office and i mean it's our studios it's
13:11
our
13:12
shipping receiving department it's a
13:14
duplicating place
13:15
and we have learned to adapt to that but
13:18
god has a plan even in doing this this
13:20
wasn't something negative he planned for
13:22
us
13:22
we had to adapt our own lives we do know
13:25
at one point in our life we will get
13:27
another home and i will so enjoy that
13:29
personal space and private place but
13:31
right now we're giving this place almost
13:33
to the whole world
13:34
so you will know who he is why he sent
13:37
you to this earth
13:38
what his plans are for you and we on
13:42
purpose on the hourglass took the h
13:44
off of the word it's not hourglass
13:47
h-o-u-r
13:50
o-u-r it's o-u-r
13:54
it's our time with god's time it's us
13:58
doing something together
13:59
and one of the other things that we'll
14:01
be talking about maybe not tonight are
14:02
the keys to the kingdom
14:04
and they they are so powerfully amazing
14:06
christ gave us so many things to
14:08
live with to make our life better if we
14:12
apply it
14:13
and that's another major thing for you
14:15
when you get revelation from god
14:17
it is not ever something just to hear
14:19
it's something to live by
14:22
and there are tips on how we can do that
14:24
in the earth
14:25
and make sure no matter what every day
14:27
when you get up you ask for
14:28
grace for abundant life it's free
14:32
it's from god it will fill you with fuel
14:35
from heaven
14:36
so i'm going to encourage everybody out
14:37
there listening let's just do this
14:38
together right now because like i said
14:41
i'm here to explain and train so i'm
14:42
going to train anyone out there
14:44
if you've not learned about asking for
14:46
grace for abundant life there's two
14:48
graces
14:49
one is grace for eternal life that
14:52
christ brings us
14:53
the other one is grace for abundant life
14:56
that even
14:57
christ operated in it says in the word
14:59
that as a child
15:01
god this is the father filled his son
15:03
with
15:04
his grace that was grace for abundant
15:07
life it's one of the reasons why christ
15:08
was able to be happy
15:10
and successful uh living downhill with
15:13
mankind
15:14
when he used to live in heaven with his
15:16
father and then all of a sudden here he
15:17
is on the earth walking just like you
15:19
and i
15:20
facing everything we did but he didn't
15:22
sin how about that
15:23
so don't let people tell you you cannot
15:25
live sin free yes
15:27
you can you choose
15:30
but in this time we're going to ask for
15:32
lord anybody hold your hands out
15:34
if you're watching right now and repeat
15:36
these words
15:38
father i
15:41
ask for and receive
15:44
grace for this day for abundant
15:48
life amen
15:51
now i can tell you right now i feel it
15:53
coming into me
15:54
it's like a shower of a light
15:56
electricity
15:58
because i am a seer and uh you know i am
16:01
a revelator
16:02
i experience the things that go on in
16:04
the spirit realm
16:05
and that was fuel from heaven being
16:07
poured into me that i will need for this
16:09
day
16:10
and if you get that every day of your
16:12
life before you get out of your bed
16:13
it won't always be your selfish self
16:16
showing up
16:17
it'll be heaven showing up you'd be
16:19
surprised that just as few words that
16:21
you've asked for and received
16:23
will help to change what's in your soul
16:25
and joy will flood your soul
16:27
expectancy hope will flood your soul and
16:30
then you'll be coming out ready for that
16:32
day
16:33
and so i hope of all of you who did that
16:35
you don't never forget that
16:36
it'll be one of the greatest things that
16:38
i ever train you in
16:40
is is called heaven protocol for heaven
16:43
culture because i've been having many
16:45
times no one up there is upset
16:47
or angry or offended nobody's confused
16:50
nobody losing deception
16:52
there's no worry there's no anger or
16:54
wrath up there
16:55
they live in that abundant life grace so
16:58
when you ask for you get filled with
17:00
that
17:00
it changed me from the first time the
17:02
father taught me how to do that
17:04
it changed me it was so important to him
17:06
that he literally caught me up to heaven
17:08
before his very throne and taught me
17:11
that
17:11
like i was eight years old most of the
17:15
things god has in his word for us
17:17
are simple but we in our human mind
17:20
feel like we have to understand every
17:23
single thing
17:24
we reason it out we don't step forward
17:26
in faith we use reason instead of faith
17:29
faith is what draws heaven jesus
17:32
said himself when i do return to the
17:35
earth
17:35
will i find faith he didn't say
17:39
will i find divine wealth will i find uh
17:42
you know will i find
17:43
people laughing and celebrating what
17:46
will i find so one thing he wants to
17:48
know is will he find faith
17:50
faith is something that creates
17:53
for you is something that you can live
17:56
with and live in every day of your life
18:00
it is a source that you will even use
18:02
when you get to heaven
18:04
okay you get trained to do things in
18:06
heaven also
18:08
i won't even share some of those right
18:09
now because that's going to be our next
18:10
broadcast
18:11
but you know what faith is more
18:13
important than the food you eat or the
18:15
air you breathe
18:16
is faith it comes from heaven
18:19
god fills you with it the more you
18:22
operate in it it grows
18:24
until you become very powerful in the
18:26
spirit
18:27
and it's hard for the enemy to deceive
18:29
you these are simple basic
18:31
truths in the word of god and people
18:33
always tell me well not always some
18:35
people say you don't even have a bible
18:37
it's in here and it's very much
18:40
alive i was raised by my earthly father
18:44
who helped to take care of 15 of us how
18:47
would you like that
18:48
living here in florida we're in florida
18:50
i love florida
18:52
it doesn't snow you know we were from
18:54
upstate new york
18:55
we got frozen all the time we were the
18:58
chosen frozen back then but now we're
19:00
not
19:02
and so you need to learn the important
19:04
things in your life right now i know you
19:06
say well we need a house to live and of
19:07
course you do we need food to eat yes
19:09
and here to breathe
19:10
but even more important than those you
19:12
need faith in god
19:13
you need to be trusting him not just
19:16
when things are going well
19:17
but in the other times when things are
19:19
maybe a little bit challenging
19:21
or you're struggling with things even if
19:24
it's something that's not good in your
19:25
life you're struggling with it
19:26
god still loves you he wants you to step
19:30
out and use the faith everybody got a
19:33
measure of faith the bible says some
19:36
you need to learn to operate in it so it
19:38
will grow
19:39
and it will become productive and it
19:41
will change the way you live your life
19:44
in this day you're not supposed to be
19:46
living in
19:47
doom and gloom or hopelessness you
19:51
are supposed to shine like the stars in
19:55
the heavens
19:56
by the way we are over those stars we're
19:58
not even under those stars
20:00
all that god made whether here or
20:02
throughout the cosmos
20:04
he made that for us we are his offspring
20:07
he is our real father we came from him
20:11
you need to know about your dna you need
20:13
to know about the generations that went
20:15
before you
20:16
you need to know about the generations
20:17
that god even had in heaven
20:20
the ages that have passed down the earth
20:21
that you don't even know anything about
20:23
god holds that in his hand
20:27
if he wanted to right now he could sit
20:28
in heaven and hold the entire earth
20:31
in his hand or
20:35
he could become small enough to step
20:38
inside
20:38
you that's who he is
20:42
he knows everything everything that was
20:44
that is or ever will be
20:46
that's who you are trusting right now
20:48
with your life
20:49
in the midst of these challenging times
20:52
you need to trust him
20:53
and make sure you say that he loves to
20:56
hear you say i trust you
20:58
god i trust your father even when i
21:00
don't understand i am trusting you
21:02
i will serve no other god there will be
21:04
no other god before me and make sure by
21:06
the way you say that to satan
21:08
he hates to hear that by the way it
21:10
makes him tremble
21:11
in these days these few weeks we have of
21:14
being with our family and being with god
21:16
make sure you're productive in them
21:18
make sure you take full advantage of
21:20
them do fun things with your family
21:22
create and to be very creative and
21:24
inventive
21:25
and adventurous in this time with them
21:28
so they get hope
21:29
built in them and not fear
21:32
what you say what you say with your
21:34
mouth right now is very important
21:37
don't declare the doom and gloom don't
21:39
declare the time has come where
21:40
everything's
21:41
going to end when god just brought you
21:44
some of you have brand new babies in
21:46
your
21:46
life right now and children young
21:48
children did you know he has
21:49
generations of time planned for them too
21:54
don't make a decision in your head that
21:55
it's all over because then you'll be
21:57
running and hiding you might miss
21:58
something god has for you
22:00
these are great opportune times for god
22:02
to bring something new into your life
22:04
new jobs new homes new positions do you
22:07
know that's how he looks at
22:09
it we need to all be in agreement for
22:11
him to do what he wants
22:13
how about if we say god we want your
22:16
will your
22:17
way you all know that scripture that
22:20
talks about on earth as it is in heaven
22:22
that is his desire for all of us and i
22:25
know some of the prophets even pastors
22:27
and leaders
22:28
if they don't know what time it is you
22:30
know what they do they go to the end of
22:31
the bible
22:32
and they start speaking about the end
22:34
leaving out generations of time
22:36
for things that god has planned that
22:37
hasn't even happened yet on the earth
22:40
some of the best times have not even
22:42
happened yet i want to encourage you to
22:44
seek god on your own get the word and
22:46
stop reading it
22:47
there's even scripture in the word that
22:49
says jesus himself said
22:51
even though that nation will rise
22:52
against nation there'll be wars rumors
22:54
of wars nations will rise against nation
22:56
kingdoms shall rise against kingdom
22:58
guess what he says at the end of that
23:00
but the end is not yet
23:03
so i will tell you from heaven from god
23:06
himself
23:07
the end is not yet so roll up your
23:10
precious rapture rug
23:12
and stick it in your closet and maybe
23:14
get one that says
23:16
this is god's time and then live by that
23:19
time
23:20
yes i know things are different in your
23:22
life i know that they've said you can't
23:24
go to church
23:25
you can't do this nobody likes the word
23:27
can't but you know they actually have a
23:29
reason for doing that
23:31
like i said just a few minutes ago this
23:33
is not a this is not a government
23:35
takeover this is a
23:36
takedown of the virus
23:40
their purpose is to try to limit the
23:42
contact between
23:43
people so that anyone who has that will
23:46
not be able to spread it they're trying
23:47
to limit the spread
23:48
of the virus and you know even it has a
23:51
time it has a very limited time
23:54
that it even remains in your body it's a
23:56
virus remember it's not a disease
23:58
it's not a plague i think hell's about
24:01
to experience a plague though
24:02
it's called the faith of god in his
24:04
people that's like a plague to them
24:06
they don't like it they don't want to
24:08
hear that and uh so we're going to make
24:10
a lot of hell unhappy
24:12
a lot of hell's army is going to be very
24:14
unhappy because we'll be operating with
24:15
heaven's army
24:16
by the way they do exist also maybe we
24:19
should take
24:20
take seriously the things that god said
24:23
in his word
24:24
it is uh is a platform for life
24:28
and how to live it it even has a time
24:31
frame in itself but i can tell you you
24:34
are not in the end day
24:36
these are powerful days start thanking
24:39
god for the things that you desire in
24:41
your life
24:41
get your children teach them how to ask
24:44
for that grace do you know i have
24:45
grandchildren that learned it
24:47
when they were not even two years old
24:48
yet and now that they're six and seven
24:51
and eight if they start to have a
24:52
meltdown do you know what they do
24:53
they reach up and they say father i ask
24:55
for more grace
24:57
and their meltdown stops you know how
24:59
this could change the way your children
25:01
grow and live themselves this is a
25:04
powerful time to get to teach them
25:06
revelation that will even inform their
25:08
whole life their lifestyle and how they
25:10
live
25:11
don't run into the darkness don't
25:13
satisfy yourself with that
25:15
i know they're even saying you know your
25:17
entertainment can't take place why not
25:18
entertain yourselves for a while
25:20
i want to actually sit down and have
25:22
conversations with each other
25:25
i know there's still television out
25:27
there and there's not much on that eye
25:28
there is there
25:29
i am grateful to god that he is taking
25:31
hollywood which is one of the things
25:33
he's had me talk about
25:34
what does that mean that means he's
25:36
taking that throne away from satan see
25:38
he's got plans you maybe don't even know
25:40
about
25:40
he has big plans for this time god's
25:43
time
25:44
he calls it the kingdom age we're in a
25:47
new season
25:48
in this kingdom age there was the
25:50
introduction of the kingdom age and we
25:52
stepped off the platform into a new
25:54
spiritual time that never existed
25:56
you begin to hear new things that god
25:57
had planned and things that you are able
25:59
to do yourself
26:00
and now we're getting into the season
26:02
where we need to be activated and
26:04
literally start doing those things
26:06
i want to thank all those who who follow
26:09
this facebook live or the my youtube out
26:12
there
26:12
you get filled with revelation all the
26:14
time i hope you're applying that and you
26:16
know what don't just apply it make sure
26:17
you share it with others
26:19
these words are not my holy words these
26:22
are gods he's given a whole new way to
26:25
live
26:26
why not introduce a whole new culture on
26:27
the earth instead of trying to change
26:29
it's really hard to change a culture on
26:31
the earth
26:31
but why not introduce heaven's culture
26:34
why not have a habitation of heaven in
26:36
your home
26:37
and not the world i'm not saying you
26:40
have to throw
26:40
everything out there is some funny
26:43
things out there that are decent
26:45
uh there are different games you can get
26:46
and play or make up some of your own
26:48
with your family
26:50
i know my family was very creative
26:52
growing up uh we had a lot of drama
26:54
people in our lives
26:55
and we had a lot of leaders and i can
26:58
tell you the most challenging children
26:59
you have right now
27:01
are probably some of the most anointed
27:03
that's a tip
27:04
on letting you know that's why they are
27:07
like that
27:08
maybe they have a very powerful
27:09
personality you know they have a strong
27:12
will and they're so
27:13
you know why god likes people who are
27:14
strong-willed because when they learn
27:16
his
27:17
you can't change it you can't make them
27:20
stop it
27:21
god says that he likes strong-willed
27:22
people when he gets him on
27:24
the path he has nobody can pull them
27:27
off so maybe that will encourage some of
27:29
the parents out there
27:30
who are now doing 24-hour a day
27:32
homeschooling
27:34
or home living i bet your children are
27:37
excited about it they probably get to
27:38
see you more now than they ever have
27:40
before
27:41
and so like i said take advantage of
27:43
this time maybe have some cooking
27:45
classes with your children
27:47
they love to learn to do new things all
27:49
the time
27:50
my parents did that with us too that's
27:52
why i actually do know how to cook
27:54
and my sister jen who is here where are
27:56
you jen just say hello
28:00
i don't like her she gonna come say
28:02

28:06
i have a whole team of people here
28:08
some of my family are part of what we do
28:11
but this is my baby sister we call her
28:13
number 15.
28:21

28:24
we have some fun things planned also
28:26

28:28

28:30
we'll do that but hopefully maybe during
28:32

28:34
that
28:35
and we're actually have some cooking
28:36
classes for y'all
28:38
in our own kitchen now you know if i'm
28:40

28:42
sweet tooth blame it on
28:44
jesus jesus loved honeycomb

28:50
to know that before the throne of god
28:52
people actually leave sweet treats for
28:54
him because he loves them
28:56

29:44
even not watching father
29:46
i pray that you will give this team
29:48
who's over this whole
29:50
uh take now and the virus that they will
29:53
give
29:53
you give them great ideas on how to help
29:56
in finances or even delay payments on
29:58
things
29:59
i do want to let you know there are
30:01
actually already companies
30:02
you're right jenna need a drink
30:07
we've heard from companies that are
30:09
actually going to delay people's
30:10
payments if you have monthly payments
30:12
doing different places
30:13
planet fitness is one of those places if
30:16
you're ever
30:17
interested by the way i'm giving them a
30:18
free commercial i am a member of planet
30:20
fitness
30:21
i don't always agree with the videos
30:23
that they're showing you know on the
30:24
screens but they have great equipment
30:26
they have a great plan
30:28
some of it's very inexpensive and it's a
30:31
good way to get
30:32
in shape which the holy spirit has said
30:34
to us since we've been doing this heaven
30:36
thing
30:37
get in shape we have a long race to run
30:40
but planet fitness has already announced
30:42
because you know now they have to do all
30:43
their stuff online
30:45
and if you if you can sign up and watch
30:47
it online learn some new exercises and
30:49
stuff
30:49
but they've already announced that they
30:51
are not going to be charging
30:53
their monthly fees as long as this is
30:55
going on
30:56
and you're not able to use their gym
30:58
they're not going to charge you they're
30:59
going to withhold
31:00
your membership payments and i do know
31:02
that there are other companies out there
31:03
doing that and there are still
31:05
some a few restaurants open of course
31:08
two thumbs up for chick-fil-a
31:12
chick-fil-a that's a company that was
31:14
founded by god
31:16
and is a really promotes the gospel
31:19
if you work for chick-fil-a you are
31:21
blessed in this world
31:24
if you've never eaten a chick-fil-a
31:26
don't show up on sunday
31:29
because they will not be open they want
31:30
to make sure you get to go to church
31:32
we're going to talk about church in just
31:34
a minute but chick-fil-a is open
31:36
i think most of the ones that are is
31:38
probably drive-through
31:40
but there's even some that actually can
31:42
come to the door the restaurant they've
31:43
taken orders right there and then
31:44
filling them for you
31:46
they are actually getting witty ideas
31:48
instead of just closing it all down
31:50
because you know we can't meet in the
31:52
restaurants or meet out in other places
31:55
and i know you're missing a lot of your
31:56
special favorite things
31:58
do you know there's a thing called the
32:00
royal fast that god taught me a long
32:02
time ago the royal fast
32:04
is even harder than the daniel fast you
32:07
know to eat almost nothing is actually
32:08
harder than
32:09
giving up every one of your favorite
32:11
things
32:13
and you wouldn't believe it was unless
32:15
you tried it but on the royal fast
32:17
that's what he has me do off and on
32:19
you don't go to your favorite places you
32:21
don't even wear your favorite clothes
32:23
okay you don't get to uh
32:27
go and be with your friends who are your
32:28
favorite friends
32:30
you fast that and spend that time with
32:32
him so i like to look at this as part of
32:34
the royal fast
32:35
because you can't go to your sporting
32:37
events you can't go to your concerts
32:39
you know you can't go out to your
32:40
favorite eating places you can't meet
32:42
with all
32:42
your 20 or 50 friends you've got i pray
32:45
god you've got
32:46
friends and god if there are people out
32:47
there that don't have any send them
32:49
good friends who will lift up their life
32:53
and not crush them down
32:55
or held back you need friends in your
32:57
life you need people in your life who
32:59
are going to inspire and encourage you
33:01
especially to know god but there are
33:03
many places and even god i pray for
33:05
those who have their weddings planned
33:07
during this time
33:08
family reunions planned i know a lot of
33:11
things are getting interrupt
33:12
interrupted right now i just want to
33:14
encourage you again as i said this is
33:16
for a temporary time
33:18
remember the hourglass thing the sands
33:21
of time are moving through
33:22
and eventually this time will be gone
33:25
and i hope you have
33:26
great memories that you will create and
33:28
make during this time
33:30
make up fun photo shoots with your
33:31
family but there are a few restaurants
33:34
still open out there you know just check
33:36
out and find out who they are
33:37
get their time frame if you still feel
33:39
like you need to go there
33:40
meet with very small groups of people
33:43
and like here in our city now they have
33:45
closed the beaches one of my favorite
33:47
places even if i don't get to go there
33:48
very often
33:50
so people were learning this is the
33:51
thing people were learning
33:53
that they could not gather inside places
33:56
and have
33:56
big events together or just have a party
33:59
together
34:00
they started doing it at the beach our
34:03
beach here is free
34:04
it's a very long beach a beautiful beach
34:07
and they started doing that i mean huge
34:09
groups 50 people here and they were
34:10
meeting
34:11
and they weren't listening to what was
34:13
being asked
34:15
of them and so now they have closed our
34:18
beaches
34:18
i'm sure people are still bicycling up
34:20
and down you know maybe outside the
34:22
beach
34:23
but i just want to encourage you please
34:25
try your very best
34:27
to go along with what they have asked us
34:30
to do
34:30
for a short period of time and when we
34:33
do that
34:34
things are happier the atmosphere is
34:36
better knowing that we're working
34:38
with the government or your city
34:39
authorities or other people who are in
34:41
charge
34:42
they're wanting to help to preserve our
34:45
life
34:46
and like i said before this is not about
34:49
limiting our life
34:50
this is giving the right to live without
34:53
that virus and father i pray for all
34:57
those out there if it's already invaded
34:58
your life
34:59
family members or yourself god i pray
35:02
for them
35:02
and take authority over the sickness
35:05
jesus was over sickness we take
35:06
authority everybody to say it together
35:08
i will no longer tolerate
35:12
sickness sickness or any virus
35:16
or any virus in my city in my city
35:19
in my home in my home and i command it
35:23
and i command it to go to go in jesus
35:27
name jesus
35:28
in jesus name and do you know there's
35:30
even a blessing when you bless your
35:32
dinner did you know
35:33
that you should end your blessing the
35:35
bible says that when you do that when
35:37
you bless god and you bless your food
35:40
it says he will take sickness far from
35:43
you
35:43
you may not have ever read that
35:44
scripture but you know i do remind god
35:46
this is what your word says
35:48
i i thank you for blessing my food to
35:51
the nourishment of my body
35:52
i thank you for the provision of it and
35:54
that might be a good idea to do that now
35:55
even if you don't have food thank him
35:57
for it and asking to bless what is
35:59
coming to you
36:00
our own family experienced people we
36:02
would give so much away our own family
36:04
we'd even give our food away and then my
36:06
dad would have a set the table and thank
36:08
god for the food and i am not making
36:10
this up people would show up at the door
36:11
with food
36:12
so don't limit yourself to what man
36:14
thinks or man's ways not even your
36:16
normal ways
36:18
step outside your box and believe that
36:21
god cares about you
36:23
but yes this is good news chick-fil-a is
36:26
still open
36:27
it's all drive-through there's many few
36:29
a few drive-throughs like i said they're
36:30
different in every city
36:32
so check in your city make sure you pray
36:33
for your local government
36:35
as well as the federal government pray
36:37
for all them
36:38
to hear god's plan to get witty ideas to
36:41
use sound wisdom
36:43
get them to step outside the box and
36:46
make sure you bless ask god to bless
36:48
them it says to bless those who are
36:51
over you when you begin to do the things
36:53
the bible says
36:54
things are going to start happening for
36:56
you so don't get
36:57
moved by things you
37:01
move things this is a kingdom age quote
37:04
you don't get moved by things they don't
37:06
get moved by this virus are you having
37:08
to stay at home are you being
37:10
quarantined make sure you move things
37:13
by declaring and decreeing taking
37:15
authority in the spirit realm over
37:16
anything the enemy is trying to do
37:18
against you those of you who already
37:20
command an
37:21
army from heaven and yes that is
37:23
possible
37:25
jesus did we can too he harkens they
37:28
hearken unto the word of the lord
37:30
he is the lord of hosts he sends them
37:32
here and yes it
37:34
is our privilege to send them to pull
37:36
down strongholds
37:37
they are our mighty weapons to put on
37:39
strongholds against the enemy

well we're back i hope you enjoyed that
40:32
and again as i said that we
40:34
are going to support um
40:38
president trump right now in the
40:40
decisions you know they're not easy the
40:42
decisions he has to make
40:44
but he has such hope for this country
40:46
and not just this country
40:48
but for the people of this country and i
40:50
know you hear me talk about america but
40:52
you know what this is where i'm from
40:53
this is my realm
40:55
this is where god sent me to live i am
40:57
aware that there are other countries out
40:59
there even great countries that have
41:00
done wonderful things for god
41:02
you know i could start listing them and
41:04
man then we go forever but i do want to
41:06
say
41:07
you know some of the greatest revivals
41:09
we've had in the past many of them were
41:11
actually in
41:12
um in the uk and i can tell you they're
41:15
the covenanters of scotland
41:17
there was patrick and all the kings he
41:20
won
41:20
for jesus christ in ireland and then the
41:23
welsh revival
41:25
wow if you never read about that maybe
41:27
in this time you should go back and
41:29
and to study these things and maybe
41:31
share something with your family
41:33
because there were great people on the
41:34
earth before we were here
41:36
and we're going to be great for god
41:38
because he wants us to be
41:39
and then even when some of you go on to
41:41
heaven there'll be more great people on
41:43
the earth because
41:44
god wants us to be great for him and
41:47
with him and so i am grateful for
41:49
president trump
41:50
if you haven't decided i would encourage
41:52
you to vote for him
41:54
and nominate him you know in this new
41:56
election in 2020
41:58
which will start a whole divine decade
42:00
for us and while we're talking about
42:02
your time right now at home this little
42:04
break in time
42:06
uh we're going to actually show some fun
42:07
things because we like to laugh
42:10
laughter is a medicine it's also a
42:12
weapon because satan can't get to you
42:14
when you are laughing so i hope they
42:15
make you laugh
42:16
here's something we've taken off of
42:17
facebook and other people have made
42:20
it's fun
42:26
so here we go we're going to start
42:28
watching some of them right now
42:30
i hope it makes you laugh and we did
42:33
enjoy
42:33
every single one of these jen did her
42:36
best to get some of the best ones
42:38
and if you have opportunity to see them
42:40
or even create some yourself
42:43
that might be a good idea i think one of
42:46
my
42:47
favorite ones of course is this whole
42:49
discussion about the toilet paper
42:51
you know i do have some rolls i haven't
42:54
counted them lately
42:55
but um maybe you could count them and
42:59
let us know how many you have
43:02
and put it in your comments you know
43:03
that might be fun for people to read oh
43:05
i've got 10
43:06
you know i've got 100 if you've got 100
43:07
you better be sharing them with other
43:09
people right
43:10
and uh but people can be very fun and
43:13
you know who gives that humor
43:14
it's god and so i hope you laughed at
43:17
those there's
43:18
many many more out there um being shown
43:22
and this is funny i love it when the
43:24
pastors and this i'm just going to give
43:27
rod parsley a
43:28
you know a thumb two thumbs up rod that
43:31
was a great little funny thing you did
43:33
with the toilet paper with the tp and uh
43:36
i think tp's taking on a whole new
43:38
meaning right now during this time
43:41
never have we had so much discussion
43:43
about toilet paper
43:45
and uh who would who would think that
43:47
would be an item of interest right not
43:49
just that of course paper towels come
43:50
right in behind that
43:51
and tissues and we go down that hole
43:53
line and you can tell what the most
43:55
important things are right when you go
43:57
to the store what is
43:58
missing the tp and even some of the
44:01
suggestions that other people have of
44:03
what we could use instead
44:04
i haven't found one good suggestion okay
44:07
i'm not adam and eve
44:09
i'm not gonna go pluck leaves off the
44:10
tree that's not gonna happen with me
44:13
and so but i know people people love
44:16
humor
44:17
and sometimes that's a door that will
44:20
open things for people to have
44:21
discussions with you
44:23
like my pink hair i might mention
44:25
briefly about the pink hair i honestly
44:27
i mind sitting here i cannot see the
44:29
pink hair on my head
44:32
and believe it or not sometimes i forget
44:34
it's there but this was not my plan
44:36
this is an example of god's plan right
44:38
here
44:39
this painter on my head and yes it does
44:42
divide asunder the flesh from the spirit
44:45
people who don't like it who bash it who
44:48
say horrible things against it
44:49
they're operating in the flesh the
44:51
people think this is a great idea
44:53
wow god is so creative look at that you
44:56
know what the rainbow belongs to him why
44:58
not have color on your head why not wear
45:00
some of it on your head
45:01
and so that's the spirit the walking in
45:04
the spirit walking in the flesh
45:05
and so god's bringing many new things to
45:07
this earth
45:09
hair color is one of them and i'm taking
45:11
another little drink of my
45:12
strength
45:15
that my man ran up and got for me
45:18
because you know i've been talking a lot
45:19
i'll be talking a whole lot more
45:21
and so why not put fun in your life
45:26
and i remember years ago when the holy
45:28
spirit told me
45:29
yes fun is a medicine laughter is a
45:31
medicine
45:32
the word says it is but he said to me
45:35
while i'm at a platform i can't remember
45:36
where it was
45:37
might have been up north somewhere he
45:39
said did you know that in this time
45:41
that laughter is actually a weapon
45:45
fun is a weapon i mentioned that a
45:47
minute ago why is it a weapon
45:49
satan will put all kinds of thoughts in
45:51
your head and the word says
45:53
take every thought captive that takes
45:56
itself above the plans of the life of
45:58
god
45:58
that means anything that is not good
46:00
anything that does not bring life or
46:02
hope or fun
46:04
creativity or you know to inspire you
46:06
encourage you
46:07
it says to take those thoughts captive
46:10
that means don't let them keep running
46:11
through your mind
46:13
if you've got bad thoughts running from
46:14
you through your mind guess who sent
46:16
them
46:17
it was hell right not heaven heaven
46:20
wants
46:21
life for us and life more abundantly for
46:23
us so you need to realize
46:25
what is running to your mind what are
46:27
your thoughts saying what you think
46:28
about enough is what you will do
46:30
and that's what my husband says also you
46:32
will do
46:34
what you will to do and your will
46:37
is affected by the things you read the
46:40
things you watch
46:41
and get this even the things you say
46:44
will affect the way you live your life
46:46
so make sure you are laughing
46:49
that you make others laugh especially in
46:51
this day
46:52
it really makes the enemy very unhappy
46:57
i will give you a list of things that
46:59
satan hates
47:01
he hates people who love especially when
47:04
they're not being loved back
47:06
he hates it when we're kind to one
47:08
another
47:09
right he hates it when we laugh he hates
47:12
it when we learn to celebrate
47:14
he hates it when we realize that he is
47:18
the one
47:18
causing all the grief all the hate he
47:21
comes to kill steal and destroy
47:24
that's going on in your life that comes
47:26
from one place
47:28
and they don't get any thumbs up they
47:29
get thumbs down there's two thumbs down
47:31
for help right
47:33
and while you're doing your dinner
47:34
blessing why not ask for triple trouble
47:36
in hell
47:37
you'd be amazed what you could ask for
47:39
and god will actually do it
47:41
and so i just want you to realize
47:43
there's a real devil i have been to
47:45
heaven
47:46
i have been to hell you want to choose
47:48
heaven hell
47:49
is not a place it's not going to be r r
47:52
there's no parties in hell no food in
47:54
hell no rest in hell
47:55
that does not exist there's torture
47:57
plenty of it non-going
47:59
ongoing torture that is what is there
48:03
don't side with the enemy don't help him
48:06
advertise
48:07
negative things hateful things mean
48:09
things don't repeat things that are
48:11
going on with your friends and
48:12
especially
48:13
don't repeat negative things about your
48:15
family if you're going to stand for
48:17
their salvation you need to make a stand
48:19
the bible says stand and stand
48:21
there for that means you declare
48:24
that there will become a a living
48:26
testimony of the saving power of jesus
48:28
christ
48:29
you declare that they will not miss the
48:31
destiny god has planned for them
48:33
you declare that they will know christ
48:36
and
48:36
serve him all of their life
48:39
those are powerful piercing words in the
48:43
spirit realm
48:44
and yes it does do something for
48:47
your loved ones as well because you're
48:49
making a stand for them even if they're
48:51
not nice to you and i know that happens
48:53
okay they're not nice they hate you they
48:54
don't want to talk to you
48:56
all that comes from what and the enemy
48:58
is doing with their lives
48:59
so why not make a stand and don't change
49:03
the stand in other words don't be
49:04
double-minded
49:05
if you're saying something powerful god
49:07
will do don't turn around and say the
49:09
opposite
49:10
you don't want to wipe out what you just
49:12
prayed and i can tell right now in this
49:14
time you need to be declaring
49:16
that this is the time for celebration
49:18
for expectation
49:20
a time for god to propel you on your
49:22
path
49:23
that it says we go from glory to glory
49:25
do you know that's an upward motion
49:27
i want to go from glory to glory to
49:28
glory i don't want to go from glory to
49:30
the pit
49:31
and fall into despair and fear glory to
49:34
the pit
49:35
where are you going you are going
49:36
nowhere so kick out of your life
49:39
choose what you will to lose from your
49:42
soul
49:42
any fear any anger any any uh deception
49:46
any confusion all that stuff comes from
49:50
the enemy you bind to your soul
49:53
because i will say this one of the
49:55
things we will be learning about over
49:57
these
49:58
this next week or so is the keys to the
50:00
kingdom
50:01
and how that opens up there's my key
50:03
right there
50:05
how the keys to the kingdom will open up
50:07
things in your life
50:08
you never had before
50:12
and it will eliminate things you don't
50:14
want your life
50:15
that you have not wanted for a very long
50:18
time
50:18
but keep coming back and bombarding you
50:21
or tormenting you
50:22
you can use the keys of the kingdom to
50:24
get rid of them
50:26
an artist friend of mine did a painting
50:29
and sent it to me which is so beautiful
50:31
it shows a person with a key about to
50:33
put it in a keyhole
50:34
and inside this whole keyhole you see
50:37
heaven
50:37
what are they doing when you use the
50:39
keys of the kingdom you are
50:40
unlocking heaven to operate in your life
50:45
so i know a lot of revelation but right
50:48
now we have decided
50:49
and god has asked us to do this
50:51
broadcast mainly to let you know
50:53
that this is not the time that he's
50:55
wrapping everything up
50:57
this is not the time for the tribulation
50:59
and as the holy spirit says
51:01
the four horses of the apocalypse are
51:03
still in the barn
51:05
and you know what the nephilim are not
51:07
roaming the earth right now coming to
51:09
knock on your door and drag you out in
51:11
the streets
51:12
uh the antichrist this is truth the
51:15
antichrist
51:16
and you can say i believe it or not the
51:19
antichrist
51:21
the antichrist spirit is on the earth
51:22
because that's satan and the antichrist
51:25
spirit
51:25
is anything that is against god that
51:27
would be like a false religion
51:29
that's an antichrist spirit anyone who
51:31
is against
51:32
christ himself and speaks against him
51:35
trying to say he is not the son of god
51:37
that none of that stuff is true in the
51:38
bible that is an antichrist spirit
51:40
the antichrist spirit is on the earth
51:43
but the antichrist himself and there's
51:45
even some people to say he's not going
51:47
to be here either
51:48
they are mistaken at one time
51:52
generations down god's timeline
51:55
those things he said in his word they
51:57
will happen
51:58
he has a purpose for them happening even
52:00
when we don't understand them
52:02
but you're in a blessed time to be alive
52:04
on this earth you are not
52:06
living in the time of the tribulation
52:10
or the perilous times or the antichrist
52:13
who will actually embody a person
52:15
it's just satan embodying a person
52:17
that's what that is the antichrist is
52:20
not
52:20
on the earth he and what he will do is
52:23
not on this earth right now
52:25
because the word says until he until he
52:29
is removed that withholds the antichrist
52:32
can't come
52:32
guess who that he is it's us the body of
52:36
christ
52:36
ruling and reigning with christ the
52:38
manifested sons and daughters speaking
52:40
to the lamb the sea and the air
52:41
commanding things to happen
52:43
with jesus christ and they happen if
52:46
they were all still here
52:48
the antichrist would not be effective
52:50
people wouldn't even receive him
52:52
it wouldn't be the tribulation time
52:54
because this time
52:55
of the manifested sons and daughters on
52:57
the earth things will be great things
52:58
will be healed things will be better
53:01
we're living in the time okay god's time
53:04
right now
53:05
is for us to be great for him to take
53:08
the knowledge of the glory
53:11
that's not just a saying that is an
53:14
action
53:16
the glory of god coming from you is like
53:20
it's like something begins to just go
53:22
and waves from you
53:24
and it will remove the enemy in people's
53:26
lives it will invade
53:28
their life their very person with the
53:31
presence of god it's like a cosmic shock
53:33
wave
53:33
like if i have my staff right now and i
53:35
just hit it
53:37
on the ground wherever i declare things
53:39
from god and i hit my staff which is
53:41
always out with me
53:42
at three in the morning as i'm declaring
53:43
the things of god i see in the spirit a
53:46
shock wave of the fire of god
53:48
going that's what the glory will do
53:52
you will take that around this world and
53:56
that hasn't even begun to happen yet
53:59
so we're not living in the perilous
54:00
times we're living in the great times of
54:03
god
54:04
the times and all those things would
54:06
begin to happen he talked about
54:08
be excited you're alive be excited you
54:11
have children
54:12
yes it's a good idea to get married and
54:14
have children they'll be greater than
54:16
you will
54:18
look forward to your children doing
54:19
greater things and being greater for
54:21
christ
54:21
than even you this is just the beginning
54:24
of a time on the earth that's never
54:26
existed so this
54:27
is not the very end he is not
54:31
going to wrap it all up and roll this
54:33
earth away
54:34
when he hasn't even begun to do the
54:36
things he
54:37
himself declared would happen look
54:40
forward to celebrating with you
54:42
i look forward to sharing with you that
54:44
god
54:45
is about great things he's behind the
54:47
scenes of everything on this earth right
54:49
now
54:50
even leaders it's a time of being
54:53
shifted
54:54
god is shifting the leaders of
54:57
governments
54:58
so he can then shape their nation
55:01
and that's what's happening in our
55:03
country right now
55:04
no matter what you think of it or how
55:05
you look at it the virus thing that gets
55:08
attached and now it'll be gone okay i
55:11
hope you'll be greater and more powerful
55:12
in god
55:13
and like i said give your family a lot
55:16
of love because one day you'll be out
55:18
there back to work again
55:19
maybe you'll even have your own business
55:22
look forward to the great things of god
55:24

55:28

55:30

00:47

00:48

00:50
i'm up even
00:51
later so uh i'm
00:54
i'm so glad to be here you know because
00:57
i get stretched in this time
00:59
and yet some of the most powerful things
01:01
come out of me in this time
01:03
and so i i can promise you first of all
01:05
i'm going to share what was going on in
01:07
the spirit realm
01:08
while all this worship is going on
01:13
you have some new hosts that are posted
01:16
here as sentinels
01:18
and uh i used to call them well well
01:21
they look like native americans
01:22
but no they've always looked like that
01:26
there's whole tribes of angels that look
01:28
like that that wear garments like that
01:30
with the symbols you know and the way
01:33
that that
01:33
came into this world was god has always
01:36
had seers
01:37
and some of the first nations were seers
01:41
and so they took some of those images
01:43
that they've seen on these beings and
01:45
they put them on their garments they put
01:46
them on their
01:47
on their tents their homes uh many of
01:50
the things you
01:51
buy that are called southwest images are
01:53
actually images from the throne room
01:56
and he has some pretty wild drummers up
01:59
there
01:59
and they were here today and there were
02:02
two new ones i had not seen they weren't
02:04
even here yesterday
02:06
they're about 70 foot tall they had
02:08
fallout headdress on them
02:12
they had pelts with living eyes the
02:14
feathers had living eyes
02:16
every feather in the headdress they were
02:18
like blue eyes all over them
02:21
and their garments just shown with the
02:23
glory and there's one
02:24
right there and there's one right there
02:27
and they were dancing the whole time we
02:29
were dancing
02:31
and i could hear that drum i love the
02:33
drum
02:34
drum sound from the throne room um when
02:37
that is played
02:38
and they were playing somewhere outside
02:40
playing there were those two main ones
02:41
but there are others
02:42
and then some came in and were dancing
02:44
on this platform
02:46
and i recently saw the same ones in reno
02:49
nevada
02:50
on the platform and they're angels of
02:52
freedom
02:55
they were they were doing a freedom
02:58
dance here
02:59
and uh freedom is coming from everything
03:02
at the enemy in golden
03:04
in denver colorado
03:06
[Applause]
03:11
and if you've ever seen some of the the
03:14
first nations or the native americans
03:16
dance
03:17
when they do that thing where they're
03:18
like this they were up here there were
03:20
two of them
03:21
and they're like dressed in blue they
03:24
have blue feathers going at the very top
03:26
of their head
03:27
right up here and there have eyes in
03:29
those feathers and all the feathers
03:31
coming
03:32
off of their wings have eyes and when i
03:34
saw them in reno
03:36
i asked the lord what are they and he
03:38
goes those are freedom dancers bringing
03:41
freedom to the area so
03:45
i i can tell you also that god is taking
03:48
las vegas and reno
03:53
as regions of as regions of glory
03:56
this will be a region of glory where
03:58
crime or sickness
04:00
where disease cannot exist
04:07
so i was i was so excited when i saw
04:10
them here today and went
04:11
so i knew who they were i knew what they
04:13
were and i could tell you the men that
04:15
were dancing you were dancing with them
04:18
up here on the platform and the glory
04:21
was just
04:21
rolling off of them as they were dancing
04:23
the glory
04:24
and so freedom and liberty is coming uh
04:28
tour land two to colorado
04:31
to nevada god is taking those regions
04:34
all right
04:35
so your lives will not be the same
04:40
and even after this weekend you cannot
04:42
remain the same
04:44
because when you have stepped into and
04:46
receive what god is
04:48
offering in this time you can't miss or
04:51
escape
04:51
receiving it you're going to get it
04:54
because you said yes
04:56
everyone yell yes now look
05:00
look up and so say i say yes
05:03
[Applause]
05:06
and so uh well i'll try to speak if i
05:09
can but they they're really outside
05:12
right now looking in there are they are
05:14
huge
05:15
beings and in in their chest they have
05:19
these strips of like
05:20
it looks like gold metal to me it's
05:23
probably real gold i'm sure it is
05:24
and in them and all these metal pieces
05:27
are shaped like that
05:28
and they have living eyes in them in the
05:31
front
05:32
in the back to see anything of the enemy
05:34
that comes against this ministry
05:37
against your people these beings will
05:40
drive them off and deal harshly with
05:44
[Applause]
05:50
them
05:52
yes yeah
05:56
just like the things of the enemy are
05:58
drawn
05:59
where there's evil where there's
06:01
darkness where there's hate where
06:02
there's violence
06:03
and i know a lot of people think well i
06:06
won't go watch movies that have
06:07
immorality in
06:08
or defiling language but violence
06:12
is just as bad it is and i want to
06:14
remind you
06:15
that one of the accusations the father
06:17
had against lucifer was
06:19
you have filled yourself with violence
06:24
so be aware when you go to watch
06:26
something
06:28
make sure it's not graphic sadistic
06:30
torturing violence
06:31
because that will go in your soul you
06:33
don't want it in there amen we're about
06:36
life not death watch things that give
06:40
life they bring celebration in your life
06:42
they're going to help your soul to
06:43
prosper
06:46
there is a promise for divine help there
06:48
really is
06:49
even as your soul prospers you will
06:52
prosper in be
06:54
in hell that is a state of existence
06:58
coming to the body of christ who will
07:00
let their soul prosper
07:03
so we need to keep the darkness out the
07:05
violence out
07:06
anything defiling keep it out you have
07:08
to guard that innermost part of your
07:10
being
07:11
the very heart of your being is where
07:13
your soul is
07:15
that's why it was so important when god
07:17
said adam became a
07:19
living soul we are not just people
07:23
we're not just a spirit we're the with a
07:26
body
07:26
people go well we have a soul no you are
07:29
a
07:30
soul according to the father you are a
07:33
living soul
07:34
it's one of the main parts of you you
07:36
can't leave that out of your life
07:38
you can't remain ignorant of your soul
07:41
because it's what you think on what you
07:42
choose and then what you do
07:45
i would say that was you yeah so more
07:48
and more in this time
07:50
we must be aware of of our soul and what
07:52
we're letting in there
07:54
as a man think us in that place
07:58
so is he out of your soul will flow the
08:02
way
08:02
you live your life the issues of life
08:05
out of it before the issues of life that
08:06
means the way you will live your life
08:08
that's what the father told me and so
08:11
the soul is very key in your life
08:13
even in your children's lives what you
08:15
put in their soul growing up
08:17
it's going to help them become who god
08:19
wants them to become
08:21
you're not just raising a child not even
08:23
the next generation you are
08:25
shaping souls in your life every day
08:28
you're shaping your own soul
08:31
your soul gets fed 24 hours a day
08:34
whatever's going around you whatever
08:36
you're whatever you're seeing
08:38
watching saying or hearing
08:42
it goes in there it goes in there
08:45
a lot of meetings
08:50
but i get excited i had to almost sit on
08:52
myself
08:53
to not start screaming
08:57
[Applause]
09:00
i've heard that around the throne i have
09:03
been there and i've heard it
09:05
it is stunning you will get so undone
09:10
by the glory over the throne and the
09:13
seraphim
09:13
who come down and dip out of there
09:15
they're so full of the fire
09:17
they are on fire they sing some of the
09:20
most beautiful song they will dip down
09:22
over the throne
09:23
and go back up and dip down over the
09:25
throne and go back up
09:29
yeah satan didn't get any of them
09:36
even in heaven they choose how much of a
09:40
relationship
09:40
they want
09:45
it was obvious and you would think
09:49
the ones who were created for worship
09:53
would not have been deceived
09:57
but they were the very ones because they
10:00
followed
10:01
they began to follow the one who led
10:04
them
10:05
not the one who made them
10:13
if they were deceived by the enemy
10:16
deception
10:17
is still it is an anti-christ spirit
10:22
and even then it was it was even jesus
10:24
said it was then
10:25
it was there even then it was there and
10:27
so i think one of the most
10:29
one of the most number one weapons the
10:31
enemy uses today
10:32
when he realizes because of our
10:34
relationship our intimacy with god
10:37
when he realizes he's not going to get
10:38
us to just outright sin
10:40
then he will try to bring us into into
10:42
deception or
10:44
distraction because we need to stay on
10:47
that path we
10:48
are running after him and no matter what
10:51
i talk about about the encounters that i
10:53
i've had or what i've seen or the
10:55
revelation he's given me still the
10:57
number one thing in my life
10:58
is to pursue him to be passionate about
11:02
him
11:02
to desire his heart his ways his words
11:06
his presence it feeds me
11:12
i eat less and less because i eat of him
11:17
there's a whole revelation about eat my
11:20
flesh and
11:21
drink my blood that is total consumption
11:24
of who he is
11:26
you are totally consuming all of him
11:29
all of what he did i love to talk about
11:31
the blood of christ
11:34
i was caught up to heaven take him back
11:36
in time and i saw him pouring out his
11:38
blood
11:38
on the mercy seat
11:43
so many encounters but nothing more
11:45
powerful
11:46
than knowing the love of christ
11:50
to know him to know not just know about
11:52
him but to know him
11:54
and he said that if you pursue him with
11:56
all of your heart
11:58
you will find him and when you find him
12:03
you will want to be just like him
12:07
it says when we see him we will no
12:09
longer know in part
12:11
or understand in part it says now we see
12:13
darkly like through a glass
12:15
we see in part we know in part but when
12:18
you see
12:18
him you will no longer know in part
12:22
that means you will know details that
12:23
means you will know his heart
12:25
his ways have his thoughts so don't ever
12:28
stop doing that
12:30
no matter what you go after in your life
12:32
don't ever
12:33
leave him out i have written in the
12:35
front of my bible
12:37
don't ever let me get to a place where i
12:39
do not need you
12:41
[Music]
12:45
in the past god would do things to
12:49
make sure that people weren't elevated
12:51
above because of the revelation that
12:53
they got
12:55
you know even in paul that thorn of
12:57
flesh he got was blindness
13:01
it would come and go it would attack him
13:02
and go attack him and go
13:04
and a lot of people don't know what that
13:05
is they they try to figure it out but
13:07
it's in the word
13:09
because paul said the first time i came
13:12
to you
13:13
you wanted to give me everything if
13:15
possible you would have plucked out your
13:17
very
13:17
eyes and given them to me
13:21
why would he have said that why did he
13:24
need to scribe all the time
13:27
because it was hard for him to see to
13:28
write
13:30
so whenever he penned a letter that said
13:33
i
13:33
have penned this with my own hand
13:37
you need to go back and read those
13:40
because he was so
13:41
fierce about having this given to them
13:44
and them
13:44
living a right life a powerful life
13:48
he would write that himself
13:51
even with that on him now i can tell you
13:54
that he stopped asking for that to be
13:56
removed when christ said
13:58
my grace is sufficient my grace is
14:02
sufficient
14:03
for the evil for for the day for the
14:05
evil thereof
14:07
and that was grace for abundant life
14:08
christ was talking about
14:10
christ never came to put sickness
14:13
disease
14:14
infirmities he never brought poverty
14:16
with him
14:17
he didn't bring fear with him he didn't
14:19
bring hopelessness or unworthiness
14:21
he didn't bring any of those he came to
14:24
bring light
14:26
and life more abundantly
14:30
and we need to walk on that today now
14:34
not just when you go to heaven
14:36
[Music]
14:37
in the past people died to move to
14:40
heaven
14:41
to walk in a certain way on in their
14:44
life
14:45
they were free from everything creative
14:48
inventive in heaven adventure excitement
14:50
fun
14:51
no fear no hate no deception
14:55
no distractions filled with the light
14:58
and the glory of god
15:00
but in this time on the earth
15:04
we have a commission to live
15:07
a whole new way so what you've been
15:10
hearing me talk about
15:11
is not just some nice things to make you
15:14
feel good
15:15
it is so you can have a new lifestyle
15:19
to live on earth as they do in heaven
15:23
that's not going to be a normal life
15:27
it's going to be the most amazing life
15:30
you have
15:30
ever lived in this world and god wants
15:34
it
15:34
wants it seen openly and
15:37
visibly in our lives
15:41
the goodness of god overwhelming us
15:44
flowing off of us wherever we go the
15:47
creativity of god
15:49
we are supposed to be creators like our
15:52
father say amen
15:55
let us make man in our image what is
15:58
your image he's a creator
16:00
what is christ's image a commander
16:06
they rule there's no higher level
16:09
anywhere in existence than the the
16:12
triune godhead
16:15
and yet how awesome is that that he said
16:18
that statement
16:20
in genesis let us make man in our image
16:24
and after our likeness that word
16:26
likeness means
16:27
operate like we do
16:31
we are joint ears with christ he walked
16:34
in so much
16:35
and we're living so far below that but
16:37
in this day because of revelation
16:40
this is what revelation is it comes from
16:42
the heart of the father
16:44
it does not come from the mind of man so
16:46
it will not sound
16:48
normal to you it won't even make sense
16:51
to you
16:52
sometimes it seems absolutely impossible
16:54
but with god
16:56
nothing is impossible all things
17:00
through christ are possible
17:04
so we need to understand and realize
17:06
what did christ give us when he came
17:08
here
17:10
what was he on this earth walking as
17:13
a righteous man
17:16
he had power and authority over the
17:18
storms
17:20
he multiplied the food he raised the
17:23
dead
17:23
all the time he never blinked at one
17:26
demon not one demon was he afraid of
17:30
where he went they were tormented
17:34
he could shift time and step in the
17:37
spirit realm and walk
17:38
through people he didn't walk around
17:42
those crowds he walked through them
17:44
because the spirit realm supersedes this
17:47
natural realm
17:49
that's why angelic means can walk
17:51
through the walls
17:54
so christ did all these amazing powerful
17:57
things
17:58
and then he says the things i did
18:02
you will do and
18:05
greater things than he did we will do
18:10
we're still trying to figure out the
18:11
things he did
18:15
you're not getting anything without
18:17
faith
18:19
you're not ever going to get to a point
18:20
where you don't need faith to do things
18:24
you have to start trusting god and
18:26
telling him you trust
18:28
him he wants you to say something
18:32
he loves it when you make declarations
18:34
he gets up off the throne and he shouts
18:38
when he sees people on the earth with
18:40
faith christ didn't say when i come
18:43
will i see power will i see dominion
18:46
will i see creativity will i see souls
18:49
being saved
18:50
no we didn't say they said well i see
18:54
faith
18:56
and so many people they just want things
18:59
but they don't even use their faith
19:02
you go from glory to glory because of
19:04
your faith
19:06
your faith can grow when you when you
19:08
hit a certain level
19:09
your faith just gets accelerated
19:13
where no matter what he has said no
19:15
matter what that word says
19:16
you live it like it's truth
19:21
we all have measures but did you realize
19:25
that a measure means it can be increased
19:28
[Applause]
19:29
if you pour something in a measuring cup
19:33
can you add more
19:40
and you can get a bigger cup
19:45
until it's pouring over isn't that what
19:47
it says
19:50
overflowing
19:52
if you get to a place in him
19:56
i want everybody to say this christ
19:58
operated
20:00
without measure on this earth
20:06
[Music]
20:09
his dream and his purpose
20:13
is for us to get to that place in him
20:16
where we
20:17
also operate without measure
20:21
i know what i'm talking about because i
20:23
was uh
20:24
in law i i worked in law that was a god
20:27
thing told
20:28
totally let me tell you they hired me
20:30
with no experience because
20:32
i was anointed with favor
20:35
and literally i was hired because of the
20:37
favor not because of my typing skills
20:42
trust me you type 40 words a minute no
20:44
one's going to want you
20:46
in the natural but i was taught i was
20:49
hired
20:50
and i was taught by the lawyers how to
20:53
do real estate law
20:54
estate planning business law
20:58
i learned all kinds of these different
20:59
levels of the different law and the
21:01
legal system
21:02
one thing i really got was in a probate
21:05
in a state
21:06
i totally knew what it meant when it
21:08
said you were a joint
21:09
heir if you're an
21:12
heir to somebody even like in england
21:16
the heir to the throne no one can say
21:19
you can't have that
21:22
it's written as law in those countries
21:25
so guess what was written in heaven as
21:27
law
21:29
that there was a last will and testament
21:31
called the new
21:32
testament that the the names of these
21:35
books aren't just put there because they
21:37
sound good
21:39
every one of those names means something
21:41
like revelations
21:44
someone tell me there's nowhere in the
21:45
bible that talks about revelations
21:50
i said god calls me a revelator i'm here
21:52
to reveal heaven
21:53
i'm here to reveal the spirit realm i'm
21:55
here here to reveal the true authority
21:57
of the believer the dominion and
21:58
authority of the believer and they go
22:00
there's no such thing as a revelator
22:03
i think john was one
22:08
a revelator simply means you reveal the
22:10
things of god
22:11
and what do you think revelations were
22:13
those were the revelations
22:15
john re received and shared
22:18
things never heard of before things that
22:20
were hard to comprehend
22:22
you think the book of revelations is
22:24
easy to understand it's because it came
22:26
from the heart of god
22:28
and he reveals himself all the time even
22:31
john the baptist gave some of the most
22:32
shocking revelations of all time
22:35
he was totally shifting the way that
22:38
those who believed in god
22:40
were going to live hey they knew you had
22:44
to go to
22:44
temple and make sacrifices and once a
22:47
year your sins were forgiven
22:49
and here was this wild man wearing camel
22:52
hair
22:53
turned inside out lived in the
22:55
wilderness he looked like a wild man
22:58
ate locust and honey was his diet
23:03
pizza and chocolate ice cream is a whole
23:04
lot better
23:07
and so is pink hair
23:12
pizza there's pizza in heaven
23:21
yes i do like it but i like thin crusts
23:26
not that
23:28
zero calories yes and zero calories in
23:31
heaven
23:34
it's one of the reasons why they call it
23:35
heaven
23:39
but it's the place where things have
23:41
never been heard of
23:43
or seen or even understood but god has
23:46
prepared for those that love him
23:48
but i love the next part of that
23:50
scripture unless
23:52
and accept it be revealed by his spirit
23:56
so that shows you the things of god can
23:58
be revealed there are mysteries in the
24:00
word
24:01
and the first time you hear them you'll
24:02
be shocked
24:04
that they were there all along but you
24:06
didn't see them because they were a
24:07
mystery
24:10
but god loves to share them with his
24:12
children
24:14
so be more like a child laugh a lot more
24:20
dream imagine the impossible
24:26
there's places telling you not to even
24:27
do that anymore
24:30
and yet let me tell you if you're an
24:32
artist if you don't
24:33
imagine things you can't you can't
24:35
produce or create
24:38
that god puts that in us to be creators
24:42
uh like an inventor that's still a
24:44
creator right
24:45
inventions witty ideas we're creators
24:49
you should be creating something all the
24:51
time
24:52
you should be doing something new all
24:54
the time you should be new
24:56
all the time i heard the father yell
24:59
tell them to be new
25:01
do something new go someplace new
25:06
think of something new say
25:10
something new don't remain the same
25:14
old same-o that's right yeah don't be
25:17
boring
25:19
see this world needs to see this
25:22
they need to hear this they need to know
25:26
that you can live without fear when you
25:28
belong to jesus christ
25:30
because you do have power over all the
25:32
power of the enemy
25:33
that we can crush the plans of darkness
25:36
that we can have
25:37
none of him in us
25:39
[Music]
25:40
and be dangerous
25:42
[Applause]
25:44
i love the whole army thing yeah
25:49
heaven has an army
25:52
strange weird
25:56
fierce unshakable
25:59
unstoppable created by the hand of god
26:03
himself
26:04
to defeat that army of darkness
26:07
but they were never created to guard
26:09
heaven
26:12
that army didn't even kick out satan
26:15
the father did the father did
26:19
he didn't even get off the throne
26:24
went up there shaking in heaven he
26:26
wasn't shaken in heaven but lucifer was
26:27
going around tempting all of them
26:30
he knew he would lose
26:34
but he was going to let others see who
26:36
really was
26:37
worshiping him who really had
26:40
given herself to what they were created
26:43
for
26:44
we replace all the angels that worship
26:46
before the throne
26:49
so you go before the throne every single
26:51
time you worship
26:52
that's how he inhabits the praises of
26:54
his people
26:56
you're connecting with heaven every
26:58
single time you worship
27:02
so when you hear about heaven it should
27:04
be something
27:06
oh yes i was going to tell you what else
27:08
i saw
27:10
right before the trumpet blew i heard
27:13
the lord say that calvary is coming
27:29
i was really having fun in this service
27:34
because i was seeing um heaven here and
27:37
what they were doing
27:39
then i saw the people connecting the
27:41
worship connecting the dancing
27:42
connecting
27:43
that they were all hearing what heaven
27:45
was saying and singing
27:46
so they played it and the dancers were
27:50
actually
27:50
impressed by what the angels were
27:52
dancing up here they were doing the same
27:54
thing
27:55
yeah and even the ones outside and the
27:58
drummers that were
27:59
lightning bolts were shooting off of
28:01
those drums
28:02
[Applause]
28:06
and and i would get so undone i had to
28:08
sit down
28:09
so i wouldn't fall down
28:13
because the glory was so thick in here
28:16
and they would dance and dance then he
28:18
would turn and look
28:20
in the window to watch
28:23
you dance and worship
28:26
and flag and shout
28:30
[Music]
28:31
[Applause]
28:53
[Music]
29:02
every congregation needs a seer
29:06
because you get so excited to really see
29:10
you
29:10
are a part of what heaven is doing
29:12
that's right because every time you
29:13
shout it whenever you shouted
29:15
they shouted in the throne room
29:18
every time you shouted something the
29:21
throne room
29:22
shouted it
29:37
[Applause]
29:42
and the father would sit there and he
29:44
would laugh and laughter he threw his
29:46
head back
29:54
because there are those who worship in
29:57
spirit and truth
29:58
on the earth and every time we do it
30:02
it pierces the enemy
30:08
and every time we do it there's the
30:11
father began to laugh
30:12
and it goes like dominoes around all of
30:15
heaven it just starts like a
30:16
wave of people laughing and laughing and
30:21
laughing
30:23
because there's a people who worship in
30:25
spirit and truth
30:26
the enemy doesn't want anyone to worship
30:28
anything
30:30
but him and you
30:33
you know he stole the glory that's what
30:35
he did he wanted to be the glory and
30:38
have the glory
30:39
and he wanted all of it even when he was
30:41
in heaven that was a bad decision
30:45
bad decision so we get to carry the
30:49
glory produce the glory
30:51
and carry the glory around this world
30:53
for him and is going to
30:55
undo this world they will be undone
31:00
i've seen some of that happening and i
31:02
know it will
31:03
it will cause thousands to run into the
31:05
kingdom
31:07
because they know what kind of life
31:08
they've been living they know what
31:10
darkness is
31:11
everything darkness has marked
31:13
everything
31:15
it's left its mark in the movies in
31:17
books and children's toys
31:19
in apparel it's just marked everywhere
31:22
it's about to be wiped out because
31:23
heaven's going to put its mark on
31:25
everything
31:25
[Applause]
31:31
you'll be able to buy home decor things
31:34
to decorate your home with
31:36
rugs things to put on your windows even
31:39
the furniture
31:40
will have symbols and images of heaven
31:42
on it
31:45
and you are past it'll speak
31:49
because god is going to put his
31:51
anointing on it
31:54
it's one of the ways the glory will
31:55
invade this earth that's one of the
31:57
reasons why heaven is invading this
31:59
earth
32:03
you'll sit on your amazing self of this
32:06
anointed and you'll just hear
32:07
sounds from heaven your walls will
32:11
release
32:12
frequencies from heaven in them
32:16
you've already created when you create
32:18
an atmosphere for heaven to inhabit your
32:20
home
32:22
and it will if they see the life of god
32:26
they see
32:26
worship they see honor being given to
32:29
the name of the lord jesus
32:30
they cannot escape they cannot
32:35
they want to be and know your lives
32:38
they're watching your lives
32:39
they've all been watching your lives
32:42
and they're cheering you on
32:45
they are heaven is very much aware of
32:47
what's going on this earth
32:49
your own family members are up there
32:51
cheering you on
32:54
run your race don't get off the track
32:59
this is an accelerated time the race
33:01
will be greater
33:03
the impact on the earth will be greater
33:05
the glory will be greater the revelation
33:06
will be greater the creativity will be
33:08
greater
33:08
the blessings and the and the wealth
33:11
will be greater than ever before
33:14
what we build for god on the earth in
33:16
the spirit and then the physical
33:18
is about to be accelerated
33:25
because this is god's time for that to
33:27
happen
33:28
so when you step into what he wants
33:32
you can't escape being blessed
33:35
you're not going to escape he used to
33:37
say that to me other times you are not
33:39
going to escape
33:41
when you say you're going to go say this
33:43
and you will not escape doing it
33:46
okay no matter what they think
33:49
no matter where it is or what it is i'm
33:52
saying it
33:54
and i'll say it as loud and as boldly
33:57
and as often as you want to
33:58
you want me to i laid down my life died
34:02
to myself
34:03
and i live in christ
34:06
and the devil can't impact a dead person
34:11
he can't tempt a dead person he can't
34:14
put
34:15
fear in them if there's none of him in
34:17
you he can't do anything to you
34:20
amen jesus said i give you power
34:24
over all the power of the enemy to tread
34:26
upon
34:27
so i can't even say it serpents and
34:30
scorpions
34:31
tread upon them and
34:34
nothing by
34:37
any means shall harm you
34:42
we're living in those days
34:46
in this new time we are living in those
34:48
days
34:50
that our life will be different because
34:53
we will be living
34:54
on earth as they do in heaven
34:59
if you heard me talk you know a lot
35:01
about heaven you should know a lot about
35:02
heaven
35:04
because god is bringing revelation on
35:06
purpose
35:08
why is he showing us heaven why do we
35:09
need to know how it operates
35:11
what is life like there what goes on
35:13
what places does he have
35:14
what do they get to do you need to know
35:17
that because we're going to live like
35:19
that down here
35:22
oh yeah they worship it's called
35:26
living worship not just
35:30
in the throne room bowing down
35:33
sometimes everybody just jumps up and
35:35
down for fun
35:37
[Applause]
35:40
yes it's holy but it is fun
35:46
some people think why should i even go
35:47
to heaven it's going to be so boring
35:50
no you've lived boring down here
35:56
because they have the greatest
35:58
adventures in heaven
36:03
god wouldn't have said you must be like
36:05
little
36:06
children to enter into the kingdom of
36:11
he'd be in big trouble if we all got up
36:13
there and we were like
36:14
you know old minded with all the fun
36:16
stuff he's made
36:18
but he knows when you come there that's
36:20
how you feel
36:21
because you're free of any cares any
36:24
concerns
36:25
you're not always warring just to to
36:27
stay safe and pay your rent
36:32
everyone up there pays for nothing
36:36
god has already made a provision and
36:37
supplied your mansion's built before you
36:40
ever get there
36:42
and everything you want love or need is
36:44
already there
36:47
but god has a sense of humor
36:50
the number one thing before besides
36:52
going in the throne room people love to
36:53
do is take tours of heaven
36:56
and they have tour guide angels that has
37:00
a cap that says tour guide and they have
37:01
a money changer belt
37:04
you know the little things that go push
37:06
click click click and the coins come
37:08
out nobody has money in heaven
37:14
they do it for humor
37:20
and and and you'll get there for the
37:22
first time they'll they already know who
37:24
the new people are
37:27
because they're like this
37:38
and then walked up one of these tour
37:39
guide angels and they go um
37:42
do you have your pass
37:43
[Laughter]
37:47
on purpose
37:51
and you hear people all around they're
37:53
giggling
37:55
because they know you don't need a pass
37:58
however the real characters go his name
38:01
is jesus christ
38:04
so if you've got one in your family this
38:05
probably will be the response
38:07
some of the others are like we need a
38:09
pass
38:12
who gave out the passes
38:18
and people laugh i mean they will laugh
38:20
and laugh and laugh and laugh
38:22
there's no past required
38:26
and you're not going to give anybody
38:28
money to go anywhere
38:30
[Applause]
38:31
you can step on a road of light and just
38:33
go yourself
38:40
and everybody talks about the humor of
38:42
god but but when you really experience
38:44
it
38:44
you realize how funny he can be
38:51
and his goodness people live in his
38:53
goodness
38:55
about a year ago he started saying start
38:57
declaring the goodness of god over your
38:59
family
39:00
your friends especially your enemies
39:06
there's almost nothing more fun than
39:08
blessing those who are cursing you
39:12
as a seer especially it's a lot of fun
39:16
because i see the demons controlling the
39:18
people who are blasting me
39:20
and i'm blessing them and those demons
39:23
are going stop
39:24
[Music]
39:26
they're screaming it's like arrows
39:29
piercing them
39:32
because i'm giving them life
39:35
which cancels out the death
39:39
that's why he said bless those right who
39:42
curse you pray for those who
39:43
despitefully
39:46
it's powerful blessing
39:50
is a weapon joy and celebration is a
39:54
weapon
39:55
fun is a weapon
39:59
they laugh all the time in heaven they
40:01

it was too bad that his son was in hell
42:08
when he had served god his whole life
42:12
the people in the world weren't saying
42:13
that we are so sorry that you have lost
42:16
your son
42:18
we know you loved him we know how we
42:20
would feel so you know
42:22
we we are having compassion for you we
42:24
really are
42:25
caring about you and we'll pray even
42:27
people who don't pray
42:28
will tell people we'll pray
42:32
that's the world saying that most of the
42:34
body was saying they're burning in hell
42:38
and that was the first time god taught
42:40
me about the difference between suicide
42:42
and ending your life
42:44
and ending your suffering he said when
42:47
you're not in your right mind
42:49
control of emotion whether it's
42:51
emotional physical
42:52
or mental you're not in control of your
42:55
own emotions
42:56
you're not you cannot think clearly or
42:59
make decisions you just know you cannot
43:01
suffer any longer so you end your
43:04
suffering
43:06
and he said those people go to heaven
43:10
he made me go to the dictionary which he
43:12
does many times
43:14
uh he has me gives me scriptures in the
43:16
word but he also says to go look in the
43:17
dictionary
43:18
to see what man says about it he said go
43:20
look up the word suicide
43:22
and it says willingly knowingly
43:24
intelligently taking your own life
43:28
he said but what most people are
43:29
experiencing that's not
43:31
that's not what they're doing okay a
43:34
suicide bomber
43:36
or a terrorist that is real suicide
43:39
they know that their life will end and
43:42
they purposely go do it because they
43:43
know
43:44
usually to bring violence or hurt to
43:45
someone else to make others suffer
43:48
is usually what suicide is about so
43:51
these these bombers are coming bomb
43:53
strapped on them
43:54
they're intelligently making this
43:55
decision oh yeah i'm willing to do this
43:57
to take the lives of others
43:59
they committed suicide but people
44:02
who either through accidents or mental
44:05
stress or emotional uh when they get to
44:09
despair
44:10
when you reach despair it's like
44:12
sickness
44:14
that they can't handle any longer so
44:16
they're ending their suffering
44:18
it's not that they don't love you it's
44:20
not that they don't want to live anymore
44:22
they can't stand the suffering and i
44:24
literally was caught up to heaven and
44:26
told that
44:26
and the father said you will tell people
44:28
about that
44:30
and i had people say don't say that how
44:33
can you say that i went would you like
44:34
to go stand before the living
44:36
god and have him explain what this means
44:40
and then you say i'm not going to say it
44:43
and they go well maybe not
44:48
and he said this is going to help
44:49
relieve the pain
44:51
and agony that people have been put
44:53
through with the loss of their loved
44:55
ones
44:55
who no longer had any control over their
44:58
minds or their thoughts
45:00
or their will and he said those people
45:03
i would be unjust and unrighteous
45:05
especially if they knew me
45:07
i would be unjust and unrighteous just
45:09
to give them to the enemy who actually
45:10
destroyed them
45:13
and he said you let them know they're in
45:14
heaven they're with me
45:16
and so he actually did this because of
45:18
that young man because of what happened
45:19
to him
45:20
and what people were saying to this this
45:22
prophet
45:23
god said i'm going to show you where his
45:25
son is
45:26
this person was visiting our church i
45:28
was doing hospitality for him when he
45:29
came
45:30
and i actually had bought all the stuff
45:31
to put the food together and in the
45:33
parking lot of my church she caught me
45:34
up to heaven
45:37
and i saw this miss this man's son
45:40
i think he was probably in his 20s and i
45:43
didn't know anything about him
45:45
and i saw him standing in his father's
45:47
mansion that was still being built
45:52
and there was a trophy on this mantle
45:55
that said satan zero
45:59
god won
46:04
and that was because satan didn't get
46:06
his son and he said you're gonna go tell
46:08
him that his son is with me in heaven
46:10
and then i and this went on for a while
46:13
he
46:14
caught me up a second time he said i'm
46:15
going to show you what he's now doing
46:16
now
46:17
and i saw him putting equipment on on
46:19
this horse he was going to go
46:21
backpacking and up a trail ride
46:23
up the mountain spices and i saw this
46:26
at the foothills was this huge mansion
46:30
that he had come out of that i knew was
46:32
his father's mansion
46:34
and so it was this beautiful amazing
46:35
place all made out of stone
46:37
living stones
46:40
not just stone there's nothing normal or
46:44
plain in heaven
46:45
there were this whole place was built
46:47
with living stones
46:49
and so i saw his son and he was talking
46:51
i can't wait for my dad to get here one
46:53
day man
46:54
he's going to be so excited to find out
46:56
there's some other way to hunt animals
47:00
this is going to be exciting this is his
47:01
first time going up there by the way
47:04
i'm sure he had some other thoughts
47:05
about that but but he that's what he was
47:07
doing us i put camera equipment on the
47:09
stuff
47:10
on this this beautiful horse there was
47:12
another horse with some other stuff on
47:13
it
47:13
so if you want to camp you can still
47:15
camp in the mountain of spices
47:18
without fear of anything attacking you
47:20
or getting lost because you can't get
47:22
lost anywhere in heaven
47:25
you're in heaven
47:30
so this is where he was going he was
47:31
going on a hunt
47:34
he was going on a hunt and i saw him the
47:36
whole time see they talk about you all
47:37
the time in heaven
47:38
they talk about all the fun things you
47:40
did the things you love to do together
47:42
you still get to do those things in
47:43
heaven
47:44
and so he was excited about his siblings
47:47
and his father
47:48
knowing about this this hunting trip he
47:50
was going on
47:52
and so he's starting up the mountain of
47:54
spices
47:55
and i see these creatures almost
47:57
transparent
47:59
peeking around some of the trees and
48:02
they had a scope camera
48:06
well he was hunting now
48:09
they were hunting him
48:13
[Applause]
48:14
and the father said hunting will take on
48:16
a whole new meaning
48:23
so that's how i learned about that that
48:25
they do that in heaven
48:27
and so i saw him i'm doing i started
48:29
doing other things i saw him
48:31
another time in his mother's mansion
48:34
which is right next to his father's
48:35
mansion
48:37
and on the walls of that mansion i saw
48:40
siblings that hadn't even been born yet
48:43
i saw family pictures of the i knew who
48:46
the father was i recognized the father
48:48
i didn't haven't really seen his wife
48:50
anywhere and you know when he traveled
48:52
or whatever
48:53
but i saw the father the mother i saw
48:54
him i saw another sibling and i saw
48:56
others that hadn't ever been born yet
49:00
god knows who he's going to send and
49:03
while this is
49:04
this is exciting i know how many more
49:06
she's going to have
49:10
and so you have precious things captured
49:13
memories and things put in your mansion
49:16
so if you ever wanted to take a photo
49:18
and you missed it and said man i wish i
49:20
had taken it the angels take it
49:22
they print it they frame it and they put
49:25
it in your mansion
49:26
[Applause]
49:29
and i had to give up that gift to do
49:30
this that was my gift
49:32
i am a photographer so he used a
49:35
business person to do all this
49:37
i'm the ceo of a company he used a
49:39
business person to reveal this stuff
49:42
he likes business people
49:46
they think clearly they're not afraid to
49:48
make plans for the future
49:50
they they make sure that they line on
49:52
everything to see what they need and
49:53
that it gets done they make sure the
49:55
people they hire
49:56
have the gifts and the things that they
49:57
need they have strategies
50:01
they have excitement they have
50:03
creativity
50:05
they don't mind connecting and
50:06
contacting with other people
50:09
no matter what they believe they're not
50:11
afraid to go talk to people
50:13
so business people like his son
50:16
master carpenter and paul the tent maker
50:20
and luke the physician all them they
50:22
were in business
50:24
so you need to be in business i'm
50:27
serious
50:27
god in this day will have more
50:29
entrepreneurs in the body of christ than
50:31
in the world
50:34
or you'll be a part of a business or
50:36
company that's headed up by somebody
50:37
like that
50:39
it's coming and so i saw the stuff going
50:43
on
50:44
and so i went and wrote everything down
50:45
i saw and heard
50:47
i typed it and i brought it typed when
50:50
he came to speak
50:52
now i didn't get to hear him speak
50:53
because i was in the kitchen
50:55
i was hospitality and i was preparing
50:57
all his meals and decorating the room he
50:59
would eat in
51:00
and i went up to my my pastor and i said
51:03
um
51:04
this is what got my pastor knew i was
51:06
going to heaven all the time
51:07
and i said oh i said this is what i saw
51:09
and he said you need to give this to him
51:13
they need this word desperately
51:16
it changed their life forever because
51:19
number one they didn't believe what
51:21
anyone else was saying
51:22
about their son being in hell because
51:24
not only
51:25
i did not know this but they actually
51:28
lived their actual home is in the
51:30
mountains
51:32
and the thing that they did the most
51:33
together was hunting
51:36
now i didn't know that about them at all
51:39
and so
51:40
god already see that's this is the
51:41
evidence he gives that their loved ones
51:43
are doing things as they always did down
51:45
here
51:47
and i didn't know any of this so this is
51:48
what they knew that i had seen
51:50
their son and the wife was so healed she
51:53
wouldn't even go out in public anymore
51:55
because of the accusations and i want
51:57
you know what the body of christ needs
51:58
to stop
51:59
doing that
52:02
no matter what happened or how it
52:05
happened
52:05
you need to have compassion on those
52:07
people because if it happened to you
52:10
you would want compassion given to you
52:12
amen
52:14
so yes there's all kinds of fun amazing
52:16
things to do in heaven
52:18
and they are never bored they are filled
52:21
with the light and the love of god
52:23
they're excited about us about us who
52:25
are on this earth right now
52:27
because this is our time to shine like
52:29
the stars in the heaven
52:31
where even when we go outside at one
52:33
point the night will be like
52:35
light about us the word says that we're
52:38
that generation that will experience
52:40
that
52:42
i know that the word says there will be
52:43
a generation which is a group and type
52:46
of people
52:46
that will be on the earth that will
52:48
taste of the powers
52:51
of the age to come the next age
52:55
after this age is the millennial age
52:59
and the powers that will be present then
53:02
for the people is that they will live to
53:03
be hundreds
53:05
and hundreds of years old christ will be
53:08
sitting on the throne his life will
53:09
permeate the entire earth
53:12
just like back in the ancient days in
53:14
the old testament days
53:16
you know they lived to be five six seven
53:18
hundred years old
53:21
so when christ sitting on the throne it
53:22
will begin to change the earth
53:24
heal the earth there will be many
53:26
millions of natural people
53:28
on the earth that didn't take the mark
53:29
of the beast nor did they die
53:32
in the tribulation and people will still
53:35
have children
53:36
in that time in heaven you don't have
53:40
children
53:42
but if you never had one god has a place
53:46
in heaven called the reserve
53:49
of babies if you never had one
53:53
you can go pick one out it'll be
53:57
you will be its mother its father you
53:59
can see it grow
54:01
step into its destiny its true destiny
54:03
is to use the gift god
54:05
your ultimate destiny for everyone
54:08
sitting here
54:09
not necessarily what you do for a job
54:11
aren't you glad
54:14
it is the gift he made you to be so even
54:17
when children go home to heaven they
54:20
will not miss their destiny
54:22
their destiny has not been stolen from
54:25
them
54:26
because their ultimate destiny is to
54:27
grow up and be the gift he put in them
54:29
their gifts are
54:30
their gifts and callings are irrevocable
54:34
and they will step into that and use
54:36
that in heaven
54:37
so if you're if you're one of those
54:39
who's lost a baby or lost a child
54:42
or a youth don't sit there and think
54:44
that their whole life was taken away
54:46
from them
54:47
they're living in the most glorious
54:49
place having the most fun they've ever
54:50
had
54:51
with friends going all over heaven
54:53
without parental guidance
54:57
isn't that the best of the best going
55:00
places doing things with jesus
55:06
he has all of your children
55:09
he has all of your babies
55:12
they're filled with life they laugh they
55:15
play
55:16
even they get to create things the
55:19
greatest levels of creativity
55:21
and technology are in heaven and some of
55:24
those
55:24
technologies that i saw in heaven are
55:26
literally going to be in this earth
55:28
because this is the time for heaven to
55:30
invade the earth
55:32
people are saying things they don't
55:33
understand how powerful that is what
55:35
they're saying
55:36
heaven is coming to earth heaven is
55:38
invading the earth
55:39
do we say that on earth as it is in
55:42
heaven is one of the most profound
55:44
statements anyone is making
55:47
because that's a lifestyle it's a
55:50
culture
55:51
it's not just sounding good
55:54
your will being done on earth as is in
55:57
heaven is a culture
55:58
it's a way of life called heaven culture
56:04
so we who are alive now get to live in a
56:06
way never lived before
56:09
because this is the time where we will
56:11
manifest demonstrate
56:12
speak to the earth the sky the sea it'll
56:15
be healed because of the glory we carry
56:19
we'll step into time and go forward in
56:21
time
56:22
we'll see things forward in time we
56:25
won't be bound by time or space
56:30
because christ wasn't and everything i
56:33
say will point
56:34
right back to him the things he did
56:38
we will do but you have to get your head
56:42
get your head and put it on the shelf
56:44
and open your spirit realize he said
56:45
greater than
56:49
so he actually saved the best for us to
56:53
do
56:55
so get off your rapturog roll it up
56:59
and stick it in the closet
57:02
the holy spirit laughs every time i say
57:03
that
57:06
because that's the first place i heard i
57:07
heard him say it to me when i was saying
57:09
were people trying to figure out and
57:10
figure out in their natural mind
57:12
everything that was being said i said
57:13
you don't get revelation that way
57:15
your spirit receives the things of the
57:18
spirit so if you're if you're sitting
57:21
there trying to figure out the first one
57:22
you missed all the rest of them
57:25
revelation is sent by god and there's
57:28
different revelations he sends for
57:29
certain times on the earth
57:31
so you're hearing new things you've
57:32
never heard about before or it wouldn't
57:34
be revelation
57:36
so i'm not going to be normal i'm not
57:39
going to look
57:39
normal i'm not going to say normal
57:42
things
57:44
that would be the same oh samo
57:47
and god's not old he is new
57:50
all the time so if you're going to hear
57:53
about heaven it should be things you
57:54
never thought of
57:56
or heard of before but not just in
57:58
heaven
58:00
but on this earth the greater works
58:05
he's not coming to rescue people and
58:06
take them out here we haven't even done
58:08
the greater works
58:09
we're still trying to do the first works
58:15
so god has given revelation on many
58:17
things that we know are in the word but
58:19
we don't necessarily have
58:20
understanding so he's revealing
58:22
mysteries
58:24
i love his mysteries when he gives me
58:26
one i get someone done like a little kid
58:29
why didn't i see that why didn't i think
58:32
of it that way why didn't i see it that
58:34
way and he said because your thoughts
58:37
aren't my thoughts
58:38
but you can have my thoughts
58:42
and you need to walk in my ways i didn't
58:45
realize how many times it said that in
58:46
the word even in the old testament
58:48
he was telling people you need to walk
58:49
in my ways you need to know my ways
58:53
because they're not man's ways
58:57
his are different they're unusual
59:00
they're amazing fantastic life-changing
59:05
they'll get you undone just like isaiah
59:07
got undone
59:09
i know how he felt when he had that
59:11
experience you have no words to even say
59:14
anything about it
59:16
when you stand before him when you see
59:18
that throne you see the living creatures
59:20
massive and huge with thousands of eyes
59:22
in their body and in their wings
59:25
worshiping them continually the throne
59:27
room is round
59:30
the throne goes up like this
59:33
like a pyramid
59:36
with different levels and the throne is
59:39
at the top
59:41
that's why satan stole that image
59:47
yeah almost everything he's told
59:49
anything he says is his he stole it
59:52
that throne goes up like levels and
59:54
there's columns and levels and columns
59:56
and levels but all goes like this
59:59
and the throne is high and lifted up and
60:01
there's four sets
60:03
of steps that go up to the throne people
60:06
are all over them gifts are all over
60:08
them for the lord and for
60:09
the father just gifts thrown up the
60:11
steps the river of life flowing down
60:13
these steps people are laying at the
60:15
bottom drinking it
60:17
sometimes he floods the throne room with
60:19
it and you're swimming in it
60:22
sometimes he opens the throne room floor
60:24
and you literally see the river of life
60:26
that goes down the streets of gold
60:28
and then people jump in it
60:32
it's a structure there's rooms under the
60:35
throne
60:37
that are under the altar where the souls
60:39
go in there and they're under the altar
60:41
crying out and we've always pictured
60:44
them like here's the altar you know i
60:46
know what altars look like
60:47
and i've always pictured people crammed
60:49
underneath these altars like how many
60:51
can you fit
60:54
because it says they cry out under the
60:56
altar but that's because the altar is up
60:58
here by his throne
60:59
and there's rooms that you go into under
61:01
the throne
61:03
and even people go in there to clear
61:04
over their families
61:07
and people go in there and they they
61:08
declare they worship
61:10
they they say things over their families
61:13
they bless their families
61:15
but there's people in there always
61:16
crying out for justice
61:19
and if you ever walked up the steps of
61:21
the throne they're very high
61:23
very wide i clearly can so clearly
61:26
embedded in my mind is the word justice
61:28
like this big
61:30
it's one of the steps of the throne
61:33
justice is one of the biggest things
61:34
we're going to get in this time as the
61:36
body of christ
61:39
justice against what the devil has done
61:41
to us for generations and generations
61:43
and generations
61:45
[Music]
61:47
to unseat him from where he put himself
61:52
the righteous have learned he has no
61:53
right to be there
61:56
we were given dominion in the earth he
61:58
was not he took it
62:01
christ won it back for us
62:04
so we're supposed to be like him we're
62:06
supposed to be different
62:08
we're supposed to be powerful we should
62:10
be fierce
62:11
against the darkness because the violent
62:14
take it by
62:18
force
62:21
not the lazy
62:25
not the ignorant
62:29
not the ones who don't care the violent
62:34
from the time of john the baptist that
62:36
wild man who was shouting in the
62:38
wilderness
62:39
repent of your sins you wicked people
62:42
the kingdom of heaven is a hand
62:46
repent and get baptized in water do you
62:48
know how weird that was
62:50
you talk about bizarre at least i don't
62:54
wear camel hair
63:01
[Laughter]
63:08
what time what
63:11
oh no but my husband has threatened to
63:15
buy me a camel costume
63:19
so every time someone says god does not
63:21
use pink hair
63:23
i show up with the camel
63:27
okay would you rather see this or the
63:30
pink hair
63:34
i've had many pastors say god does not
63:35
do things like that he wouldn't do that
63:37
you know you need to know him more
63:41
because i know what the word says and at
63:43
least he's not trying to tell me to walk
63:45
around naked for two years
63:47
sleep on one side turn it over sleep and
63:49
cook my food on dung
63:52
pink hair is a lot better
63:57
and you know what they can't fight
63:58
against the word
64:00
i think john wore camel here is that
64:02
correct
64:04
well that was for that time no
64:08
and that way god never changes
64:12
he always does weird things to his
64:14
prophets
64:17
because he doesn't hide them
64:20
he makes sure you don't ever forget them
64:24
this is a marketing ploy for heaven
64:26
right here
64:29
and it works i get people saved on the
64:33
plane
64:33
in the airport security check-in
64:38
tsa
64:41
i get favor all the time in the airport
64:45
because i declare i do people even the
64:48
security people walking through the
64:49
airport recognize me now
64:51
they'll walk past me really quiet and
64:52
they'll just kind of edge me over like
64:54
they're going to interrogate me or
64:56
something
64:58
they do they come up with their badges
65:00
and everything they get me over where no
65:01
one kisses them they go
65:03
so what is god showing you from heaven
65:14
and then they'll just walk with me
65:15
wherever i'm going they're walking me so
65:16
uh it's okay
65:18
um and they'll say i know you're busy
65:20
and i know you got a plane to catch so
65:22
you can just talk to me while we're
65:23
walking
65:24
while we're walking
65:29
it's quite fun because they recognize
65:31
the pink hair
65:33
you can't hide
65:36
one day this will be normal
65:40
because heaven's invading earth
65:43
and everyone in heaven at one time or
65:45
another has highlights in their hair
65:48
if they have a big celebration in the
65:50
throne room everybody puts highlights in
65:52
their hair
65:54
they do it with light think really hard
65:57
about doing that
65:59
it's heaven culture because it's strange
66:06
but i can't tell you how many people
66:08
have said i love your pink hair
66:10
and it opens a conversation about jesus
66:12
christ
66:14
that they didn't expect so i leave them
66:17
in their soul with words they never
66:19
expected to hear
66:21
that he asked me to have this in person
66:25
so the world would know he loved them
66:29
and so i'm not bashing them or accusing
66:30
them or threatening
66:32
them i'm giving them life and they will
66:35
never forget that
66:37
[Applause]
66:38
and guess what it's too late to escape
66:41
because the anointing's already going
66:42
into them and the anointing breaks uh
66:47
so pink hair let you really see
66:48
anointing
66:50
green hair blue hair purple hair
66:52
whatever
66:54
they even put diamond dust in your hair
66:56
in heaven
66:59
it's beautiful isn't it and some people
67:02
are so afraid to
67:04
receive revelation and yet or they want
67:07
well i like a cafeteria it's a cafeteria
67:09
i'll take these revelations but these
67:11
are just too wild i don't want them
67:14
this is just too far out no i don't
67:15
think that's god
67:17
and when you miss him when you do that
67:20
because if he's anointed someone to
67:22
speak on his behalf and they live
67:24
what they speak you should pay attention
67:28
if they're sharing deception or if
67:30
they're living unrighteously
67:32
trying to tell you things from god i
67:33
wouldn't take anything from them
67:37
because their their souls been twisted
67:40
either to live in deception and believe
67:42
it and share it
67:44
and you can tell deception they always
67:46
end up by saying
67:47
that you don't need jesus christ no
67:50
matter what they start with it's an
67:51
anti-christ spirit
67:53
all the false religions are an
67:55
antichrist spirit but the deception
67:57
that is so released now into mainly into
67:59
the body of christ
68:01
because the world doesn't care the world
68:02
wouldn't need the deception they don't
68:04
know christ anyway
68:05
so he's hitting the body of christ with
68:07
deception and it sounds really good and
68:09
even plausible because
68:11
people can take the scriptures and make
68:13
anything out of them
68:15
and it can appear that it doesn't matter
68:16
whether you sin or not
68:18
you know or that god loves everybody so
68:20
much the earth and the fullness thereof
68:22
is here so he's taking everyone to
68:23
heaven they'll actually use that
68:24
scripture for that
68:26
that's not what the word says
68:29
or they'll say there is no satan there's
68:33
there's beings like him but there is no
68:35
real literal satan
68:37
well then jesus was blinded when he was
68:39
encountering them on the mountain of
68:41
temptation
68:44
he talked about him he was kicked out of
68:46
heaven
68:48
there is a being and i've seen him also
68:52
and his eyes are filled with death
68:56
but he's not red he doesn't have a
68:57
pitchfork
68:59
or a pointed tail
69:03
i think that image is to make him look
69:05
sort of like a cartoon
69:08
but he's not he's deadly he hates
69:10
everyone even his own demons he hates
69:12
them
69:12
he loves nothing or no one and his
69:16
greatest desire is to take everyone to
69:17
hell
69:19
so we need to be fierce about winning
69:21
people of course
69:23
but in this day we have a greater
69:26
revelation to do things in more powerful
69:28
ways and accelerate it
69:31
like be free stay free of everything by
69:33
losing stuff from your soul
69:34
the keys to the kingdom which you loose
69:37
on earth will be loosed in heaven
69:40
you don't have to keep not even a care
69:42
if you realize that you're having a care
69:44
you've been
69:45
being concerned about stuff and then it
69:47
goes into worry
69:49
and then it can actually turn into
69:50
sadness or even levels of grief
69:53
or despair you don't want that in your
69:57
soul so
69:57
if i even realize that i'm sad
70:01
i will loose that sadness from my soul i
70:03
won't keep it
70:05
you don't have to keep it we cast all
70:07
our cares on christ
70:11
one of my favorite scriptures another
70:13
one is luke 2 52
70:15
and jesus increased in wisdom and
70:18
stature
70:19
in favor favor
70:22
favor favor with god
70:25
and man is that what it says
70:30
yeah then we need to be doing that don't
70:32
we
70:35
when we take the word as truth absolute
70:38
truth and we begin to apply that to our
70:42
life you'll see your life
70:43
change even if you didn't have
70:46
revelation on it
70:47
and you just start applying the word not
70:50
just
70:51
reading it it's a life book
70:54
it's a book the way to live your life
70:57
but when we start applying what we're
70:59
reading
71:00
he then gives us revelation so we can go
71:03
from glory to glory
71:07
we have weapons we have been given
71:10
spiritual weapons
71:12
not earthly weapons we're not supposed
71:15
to fight against
71:16
people everybody say that
71:20
we do not war against the flesh
71:23
so why do we do it because we're
71:26
listening to the enemy
71:28
he wants to keep us busy fighting so we
71:30
will never come together
71:32
because then we will be deadly
71:35
he wants you dangerous but when you
71:36
begin to come together and operate and
71:38
rule and reign we will be
71:39
deadly to the plans of the enemy will
71:42
crush darkness push it out of whole
71:44
regions
71:46
he's going to have a miserable life
71:48
[Applause]
71:49
i want him miserable
71:55
i want him terrified
71:58
he's been doing that to us long enough
72:03
christ didn't walk in fear i love the
72:07
scripture fear not
72:08
take no thought for your life
72:12
if he holds it in his hand and you're
72:15
running after him
72:17
then nothing can take you out of his
72:19
hand
72:21
if he takes you home you're still in his
72:22
hand
72:23
[Applause]
72:28
it says the grave and death they have no
72:29
victory
72:31
right and people go well we'll know each
72:33
other in heaven no no death shouldn't
72:34
even touch you in your thoughts
72:38
life should be there not death
72:41
to be spiritually minded is life
72:46
so if you're focused on life and living
72:48
and giving life
72:50
and helping people to live and be
72:53
greater and do greater
72:54
then death will be far from you
73:00
i love what he said about john when he
73:03
said what is it to you if i let him
73:04
remain till i come back
73:07
they couldn't even kill him he's a good
73:10
example
73:11
of living life and sharing life the
73:13
first words out of his mouth was always
73:15
about life and love
73:18
his last great message love one another
73:21
they didn't want to hear they want to
73:22
hear mighty mysteries they want to hear
73:24
more revelations of heaven
73:25
but they brought him out on the litter
73:26
what did he say
73:29
love one another we need to do that more
73:33
too
73:35
the more we focus on living and being
73:39
something and doing something for god
73:40
we're agreeing with him
73:42
when you agree with him that is powerful
73:47
the world should see as powerful they
73:50
should see us
73:50
loving helping and caring one another
73:53
even more than we do the world
73:55
it says to consider those of the
73:57
household of faith
73:58
first does it say that
74:02
then we need to stop fighting each other
74:06
lay down your differences you're going
74:08
to live in heaven
74:12
you'll wish you did it sooner
74:17
i'm speaking to the pastors not just the
74:19
body
74:21
you're the example of god in your church
74:24
start acting like him
74:28
don't put fear in your people don't tell
74:29
them the end is coming buy see rations
74:31
and run to the hills
74:32
tell them to get rid of the rapture rug
74:34
let god decide when that happens get
74:36
your crown on
74:38
start reaching out to each other and
74:40
caring cross those denominational lines
74:42
or just wipe them out completely
74:44
[Music]
74:46
when the fire god begins to hit you
74:47
you're not going to care what the name
74:49
of your church is
74:52
[Applause]
74:54
the fire of god and the fear of the lord
74:56
will hit you at the same time
75:00
you crawl on your knees to love one
75:02
another
75:03
because you can't stand up
75:07
you forget what you were fighting about
75:15
christ set a wonderful example of loving
75:17
people
75:19
especially his disciples
75:23
he gave me a whole new picture of them
75:27
god took me back and let me see a life a
75:29
day in the life of christ
75:32
with his mary man
75:36
now this was like in the first year he
75:38
was with them
75:41
when he was still having to tolerate
75:42
them
75:46
the sons of thunder there was a reason
75:48
why they called him that
75:51
they weren't calling fire and lightning
75:52
down from heaven they were creating it
75:54
on the earth
75:56
because they fought over pretty girls
76:02
they were so full of themselves
76:06
they liked themselves a lot
76:10
and competed a lot even while they were
76:13
walking down the road to take the truth
76:14
in the gospel
76:16
behind the messiah
76:19
luke the great physician all his
76:21
patients were chasing him down the road
76:24
why did you abandon us you left us for
76:27
him
76:28
we need you you took care of us we need
76:31
we need you we we need you to take care
76:33
of us we're
76:34
sick don't you care about us and they're
76:35
all hobbling down the road after luke
76:38
the tax collector they were throwing
76:40
rocks in him
76:42
you better duck they didn't like him at
76:46
all so here's jesus with this these
76:49
these people that god had given him
76:53
you ever felt that way about the god the
76:54
people god sent you god sent to you
77:00
are you sure
77:03
because i don't think it sounds like you
77:06
it doesn't look like what i thought it
77:08
would look like
77:11
i have to pray even harder for my own
77:14
staff
77:18
can you open their ears so they can hear
77:21
simple things
77:24
[Music]
77:26
then when you think you got it made
77:27
they're all together he adds some more
77:31
that were harder than the first ones he
77:32
sent you
77:34
and god said i didn't make it easy on my
77:36
son
77:38
that's why he ran to the mountain to be
77:40
with his father
77:43
all the time
77:47
don't you ever feel like you got to get
77:48
away
77:50
christ's dead and on top of that his
77:53
family was always pursuing him
77:56
this is not what we thought you would be
77:58
doing
77:59
are you done
78:03
when are you coming home they didn't
78:06
want him for his revelation
78:08
they didn't even want him for the
78:10
miracles he did
78:12
i know they probably never asked him
78:16
where did you hear that that's amazing
78:19
wow
78:20
you raised the dad are you coming home
78:22
to make more wine from heaven
78:26
now we gotta work
78:29
your carpentry business it's going to
78:31
the dogs
78:33
don't you care about it does this sound
78:37
like
78:38
family
78:41
and jesus knew he was going to be about
78:43
his father's business
78:45
and he didn't go back home do you
78:48
realize sometimes they actually lived
78:50
with him when they traveled
78:51
so it wasn't like just going down the
78:53
road he had to listen to when they all
78:54
got together at the end of the day
78:58
and in the beginning what they said
78:59
wasn't good i know when you live
79:02
positively and deal with life and
79:03
someone starts talking negativity it's
79:05
like crushing you
79:09
it says don't be the friends of an angry
79:11
man
79:12
there's a reason for that you're going
79:14
to get filled your soul get filled with
79:16
it
79:17
well if you live with someone who's
79:18
negative every word that comes out of
79:19
the mouth is negative you begin to
79:21
you cannot bear it okay
79:24
i taught all my family to lose stuff you
79:26
better lose it because if you don't i'm
79:28
gonna know it
79:30
if you didn't ask for grace for that day
79:32
that's gonna show up too
79:36
no wonder jesus had to be filled with
79:38
god's grace as a child
79:42
it says so in the word as a child he
79:44
filled him with his grace god has grace
79:46
it's the abundant life grace that's at
79:49
his throne
79:50
of grace christ came to bring life
79:53
grace for eternal life but he also was
79:55
allowed to impart
79:57
abundant life because as a child his
79:59
father filled him with abundant life
80:02
therefore he can impart it but god gives
80:04
you infusion with you can impart it
80:07
he knew he's going to need that grace to
80:09
live with those men
80:13
and yet look how powerful they changed
80:14
the world
80:16
didn't they they became exactly what he
80:19
wanted them to become
80:21
took a while
80:24
but they had it in their soul they saw
80:26
him he was mentoring them
80:29
for three years gave his life and so
80:31
their his life into their lives
80:33
and was excited when they began to
80:35
travel through the spirit realm like
80:36
philip
80:38
and where john became love
80:41
he didn't just share love he became love
80:44
he was saturated with love
80:46
that's why he said the one that christ
80:48
loved
80:49
he didn't even give his name sometimes
80:51
he talked about love poured love into
80:53
people all the time
80:54
that's why people were drawn to him
80:56
after christ was gone
80:58
he actually believed when he went to the
81:01
tomb
81:04
you know why he was the closest one to
81:05
jesus
81:07
he would not be apart from him
81:10
he wanted to hear every word he said
81:13
oh wow i can't believe time went by that
81:15
fast
81:19
the closer you get to christ the more
81:22
you're going to become
81:24
like him we cannot lead jesus out of
81:28
anything that we're doing
81:30
you wouldn't have any rights to do any
81:32
of this
81:34
you can't be a commander but we can't
81:37
because he was a commander
81:40
we can't be a creator but the father and
81:42
he both were creators
81:44
we can be creators
81:47
we are over time because they were over
81:50
time
81:51
we're over the weather because christ
81:53
was over the weather
81:55
he didn't mind demonstrating he was
81:56
trying to teach his disciples to do that
82:00
we can multiply food i've already done
82:02
that
82:03
at a funeral he has connected me too
82:08
he's so connected me to life after death
82:12
no one can ever tell me there's not life
82:14
after death there's more life after
82:15
death than you had down here
82:18
that's why we have to live on earth as
82:20
they live in heaven so people can see
82:22
life in us
82:23
[Applause]
82:28
christ was the lord of hosts this is my
82:31
last thing i want to share with you
82:33
it's about engaging with the army of
82:34
heaven i love the song
82:37
we're supposed to engage with the army
82:39
people think that's just too weird
82:41
we're not supposed to have anything i've
82:42
heard something you're not supposed to
82:43
worship angels
82:45
do you know where that came from back in
82:47
the day when the angels
82:48
were sent watcher angels were sent to
82:50
help educate mankind
82:52
god put them here because he had no one
82:54
on the earth to represent him
82:56
they had severed the relationship with
82:57
god so he couldn't teach him
82:59
himself like he was teaching adam
83:02
he literally put there's a whole tribe
83:03
of angels called watch your angels they
83:05
all have flesh
83:06
melchizedek is the head of that tribe
83:10
he also is the father's personal high
83:12
priest
83:13
he has always existed he wasn't someone
83:16
who lived on the earth died and went to
83:18
heaven became melchizedek
83:20
i know people believe that even some of
83:22
the jewish tribes believe
83:23
that he was someone who you know walked
83:25
on the earth but it said he has no
83:27
father no mother no beginning nor end
83:29
so there's still mysteries we need to
83:31
know about
83:33
but the hosts were created to protect us
83:36
to guard us to keep us in all our
83:39
ways
83:43
part of that taking power over all the
83:45
part of the enemy is using the host of
83:47
heaven
83:48
that army was created by the father in
83:51
detailed
83:53
tribes fierce they become weapons
83:57
they ship shape from their person into
83:59
weapons
84:00
when they go and fight the demonic but
84:03
he didn't need them to guard heaven
84:05
he was on the throne so why did he make
84:08
them
84:08
they waited for ages
84:12
to actually do what they're created to
84:13
do to be weapons in
84:16
our hands they those weapons
84:19
they are mighty they literally
84:22
can get ahold of the strongholds and
84:25
pull them down
84:28
we rule by what we say by the way we
84:31
live our life
84:32
like christ did he was a commander
84:36
and the lord of hosts when he spoke they
84:39
did it
84:41
does christ live in you
84:45
if we do the works he did and greater
84:47
works than he did
84:49
those angels were created for this time
84:52
and day we live in
84:53
for those who run in the kingdom who
84:56
live in the kingdom
84:58
who rule in the kingdom in that
84:59
spiritual kingdom there is a spiritual
85:02
army at our call
85:06
walking is a man a righteous man on the
85:08
earth christ said
85:10
to the religious hierarchy if i wanted
85:13
to
85:13
i could call the army of heaven to come
85:15
and fight on my behalf
85:18
are we joint heirs
85:21
of all that he had or did then why would
85:24
that leave them out
85:26
that's good they are bored
85:32
there was a time and day on this earth
85:34
that god said that said from this point
85:35
on
85:36
they will command an army like my son
85:39
commanded an army
85:41
because they are joint heirs i have
85:43
created them to protect them keep them
85:45
and all the way
85:45
till one day they won't even dash their
85:47
foot upon a rock
85:49
and nothing by any means shall harm them
85:52
you can fight against this revelation
85:54
argue about it this is something from
85:56
the father
85:57
you invite heaven's army to be your
85:59
weapon like you invited christ to be
86:00
your savior
86:01
and by the holy spirit to indwell you
86:04
heaven protocol
86:04
you have to invite they don't just come
86:07
on their own
86:08
generally in the past when we all pray
86:10
in groups they could come and do some
86:12
things
86:12
in general areas but this is the time
86:16
for us to be fierce to be focused
86:18
to crush the plans of the enemy to have
86:20
power over every
86:22
single power of the enemy and they are a
86:24
weapon
86:25
your weapons they are mighty to the
86:28
pulling down of strongholds
86:31
you need to pursue that you can say i
86:33
don't want it
86:34
and not do it but in this day of what's
86:37
coming on this earth
86:38
they will protect you and keep you
86:42
i have not been attacked at
86:45
all from the day the father came and
86:47
taught me how to invite heaven's army as
86:50
a weapon
86:51
and then give them orders to bring
86:52
destruction to the plains the enemy to
86:54
pull down strongholds wherever i go
86:56
send them before i go somewhere so that
86:58
nothing will hinder me haunt me or get
87:00
in my way
87:05
you can think about it pray about it but
87:08
i know about revelation
87:11
you don't just hear it you do it
87:16
the work of the lord you don't just hear
87:18
it
87:19
you do it when you rule and reign you
87:21
don't talk about it
87:22
you do it if you're going to be violent
87:25
against the enemy you can't just keep it
87:27
inside and go i'm so upset and angry
87:29
you do something about it
87:36
so stand up i'm going to pray over all
87:37
of you
87:45
father i declare and decree that these
87:49
children of you're standing here today
87:51
that you open their ears to hear
87:55
clearly spiritual ears open their eyes
87:59
their spiritual eyes to see clearly
88:02
in clarity let them see the host around
88:06
them
88:06
let them see them in the sky let them
88:09
see them sitting beside them
88:11
let them see carrying out orders
88:16
because they were sent from headquarters
88:18
[Music]
88:19
by the lord of hosts who was their chief
88:23
commander because he was a commander
88:26
we are supposed to be commanders god
88:29
said command ye
88:30
me he didn't say beg yes
88:35

88:44
handle the wealth of the wicked
88:47
they will get revelation they will have
88:49
encounters
88:51

88:54
a new creation
88:57

88:59
world
89:00
because we won't be normal

[SPECIAL]Kat Kerr URGENT PROPHETIC AMERICA: OPERATION RESTART | April 21, 2021
by Sermon For You April 21, 2021
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLANiArcpU
or https://youtu.be/kBLANiArcpU

00:00
thought i would talk a little bit and
00:01
then maybe jen could come up with some
00:03
questions because you know we get them
00:04
all the time
00:06
either about heaven or something else
00:08
but um yeah i'm so filled with god right
00:10
now after doing that interview it was
00:12
very powerful
00:13
and so i thought i'd talk some more
00:15
about the restart of america which is
00:17
still continuing
00:18
and i know some places is a little bit
00:20
slower than others
00:21
uh we're having really a great response
00:24
from our governor
00:25
here in florida so we're really excited
00:27
about that we're praying for others who
00:29
aren't really maybe getting the same
00:31
response from theirs
00:33
just remember on election day who you
00:34
vote for next time
00:36
and i just want to encourage you that
00:38
that we're hearing more and more things
00:41
are being reopened
00:42
and then the reopening is being expanded
00:45
to
00:46
like more people able to attend and
00:47
stuff like that i don't think they're
00:49
quite ready to do mass
00:51
crowds meeting together for big events
00:53
and stuff like that so i'm sure a lot of
00:54
people are being affected by that
00:57
i'm sure that that was not easy for any
00:59
of them
01:00
and i know many people try different
01:02
things like drive-by church
01:04
you know online church was amazing
01:07
yay dede and david in colorado at um
01:11
up on lookout mountain they did a great
01:12
job i think they broadcasted every
01:15
single night
01:16
since the quarantine happened they're
01:18
still doing it and they're still
01:19
doing it and that would be um gateway on
01:22
mount zion gateway on mount zion
01:25
online you can go yeah their facebook
01:28
page or their website
01:29
their website in uh yeah gateway on
01:32
mount zion in
01:33
golden colorado they're really powerful
01:36
and i know there were many others who do
01:37
that i just happen to know
01:39
that they are one of them and let me
01:41
tell you god is going to be
01:43
really be visiting places it was a
01:46
wonderful thing
01:47
the day the holy spirit invaded our
01:49
earth
01:50
and let me tell you he is my best friend
01:52
make sure you know him well
01:54
he will share things with you to come
01:56
he'll give revelation on the word of god
01:58
he'll tweak your life all day long and
02:01
jen and i both know he does that with us
02:04
he'll even go shopping with you and tell
02:06
you the best deals to get and
02:08
honestly i'll even go to get something
02:09
like i want to pick apples out
02:11
he'll actually tell me don't get those
02:12
get these other ones are going to taste
02:14
better
02:14
it depends on how much you open yourself
02:16
up to him you know he's the third member
02:18
of
02:19
passing that's what god's been saying is
02:20
just going to pass on
02:22
and there will be no second wave he has
02:25
assured me of that many times so i hope
02:27
that encourages some people
02:29
and i know in other countries people
02:31
really also been praying to god for many
02:33
things
02:33
that they need help with and we pray for
02:36
people
02:37
all the time to be touched by god to be
02:39
ministered for resources to come
02:41
for help to come to different people and
02:43
you know i know to some people it looks
02:45
like utterly impossible don't say it's
02:47
impossible
02:48
you need to stay with god all things are
02:51
possible and begin to thank him for the
02:52
things you need
02:54
if you've been praying and asking him
02:55
that's fine but start thanking him for
02:57
these things
02:58
it says call those things that be not as
03:01
though they were
03:03
that means you talk about them like
03:05
they're already here
03:06
that's called faith so i want to
03:09
encourage everybody
03:10
i hope your faith has been increased
03:12
during this time
03:13
and i know this is something probably
03:15
most people will never forget
03:17
of course there'll be generations coming
03:18
behind us that don't know anything about
03:20
that
03:21
but i think this has been a very
03:23
different time
03:24
and and hopefully the best part of you
03:27
has come out during this time
03:29
don't forget to pray and reach out to
03:31
others there are many people
03:33
who we may have less of things but let
03:35
me tell you there's some that have
03:36
nothing
03:38
and my dad's heart was always to help
03:40
those kind of people we spent years and
03:42
years
03:42
helping people feeding them finding them
03:44
clothes finding them jobs
03:46
finding houses for them that was just
03:50
put in me
03:50
and so that's my heart is to be help
03:53
people
03:53
be generous you know and sometimes be
03:56
generous even when you need something
03:57
yourself
03:58
that touches the heart of god when you
04:00
give out of your own need
04:02
it really does touch god's heart and i
04:04
know that right now he's got great
04:06
things prepared for all of us
04:07
i just finished saying that in our
04:10
interview with steve schultz of elijah's
04:12
i'm going to encourage everyone out
04:14
there if you are not signed up
04:16
to elijah list.com you need to go
04:20
do that because he has the proven
04:24
prophets you'll hear words from prophets
04:26
some you know some you don't know
04:28
and then you can watch and see what god
04:30
does once they have spoken and declare
04:32
things
04:34
he's had me on there several times just
04:36
discussing things prophesying things god
04:38
has said
04:39
and he won't let people come on there if
04:41
all they want to do is bash and bring
04:43
doom and gloom and death and destruction
04:45
this is not the time for that to happen
04:47
in this earth
04:48
these are the greater days of god and so
04:51
i really want to encourage you
04:53
keep declaring that the restart
04:55
operation restart will be fully taking
04:57
place
04:58
and that people will be able to go back
05:00
to somewhat of a normal life i hope it's
05:02
not going to be normal as far as god is
05:04
concerned i hope you've increased your
05:06
relationship with your family
05:08
and with him and then get ready for some
05:10
awesome things to begin to happen
05:13
for all of us and that we also pray for
05:16
people in other countries god i thank
05:18
you
05:18
for helping to bring supply to those
05:21
countries that don't have supply
05:24
we speak against and take authority over
05:26
any of the virus right now we won't
05:27
tolerate the virus even anywhere on the
05:29
earth in jesus name
05:31
we are over sickness and disease we are
05:33
not under it
05:34
christ was never upset he was never
05:38
controlled by any form of sickness or
05:39
disease when he walked down this earth
05:41
and you shouldn't either he didn't have
05:44
to put up with lack
05:45
okay with violence he didn't have to put
05:48
up with um
05:50
any forms of oppression or depression he
05:53
didn't keep
05:53
in him and he didn't participate with it
05:56
and make sure you're saying that
05:58
yourself
05:58
there's people out there right now if
06:00
you're oppressed don't tolerate it
06:02
loose it out of your soul get rid of it
06:04
don't let it control you don't let fear
06:06
control you
06:08
because this is not going to drag on for
06:10
years and years and why am i saying that
06:12
because i was in the grocery store the
06:14
other day and the person just
06:15
you know just ringing up my my supplies
06:19
they were saying that their self oh i
06:20
just think this is going to last for
06:22
years what are we going to do we don't
06:23
have any kind of a life and i said well
06:25
that is not correct this is for a very
06:28
short time
06:29
it's going to pass and then your life
06:31
will begin to
06:32
increase again so anywhere i can give
06:36
hope or encouragement to people i'm
06:37
going to do that
06:39
that's what we're supposed to do and so
06:42

08:36
before we start i already have a
08:38
question that i was asked the other day
08:41
and jen just reminded me
08:43
people are asking about our 2020
08:46
calendar
08:47
i know the year is almost half over but
08:49
this isn't just about the months or the
08:51
days of the months
08:53
this is about revealing heaven and these
08:56
calendars we create are what god wants
08:58
he wants to reveal heaven to the earth
09:00
the spirit realm to the earth
09:02
the host of heaven the army of heaven
09:03
whatever it is he once revealed that's
09:06
part of our job
09:07
to reveal heaven to earth and so they
09:10
want to know about our calendar because
09:12
we've been talking about it lately
09:14
there's some fun activities in there
09:15
that you can do with us that interact
09:17
with us
09:18
and one happens to be this month that's
09:20
how this whole thing started this is the
09:22
calendar right here
09:24
i hope you can see it it's called the
09:27
world called heaven
09:29
and on the cover is an actual picture
09:33
of a place that exists in heaven
09:36
we all know about hebrews 12 1
09:39
that talks about the great cloud of
09:41
witnesses that are watching this from
09:43
heaven
09:44
this is one of the places they do that
09:46
this is called
09:48
the portal and they have them all over
09:50
heaven people come in
09:52
way here this is the doorway walk down
09:54
here they walk up steps
09:56
these are steps that go up here to this
09:58
opening you can see the opening right
09:59
there
10:00
and that's where people look down in
10:02
they can view the earth declare over the
10:04
loved ones
10:05
see things happening good things
10:06
happening on the earth
10:08
and they sing they go and sing to you on
10:10
your birthday
10:11
they they understand they get to see
10:14
weddings and babies being born and all
10:16
kinds of things like that
10:17
so this is a beautiful place that's
10:19
mentioned in the bible
10:21
i was taken to that place and so this
10:23
entire calendar
10:25
actually that's what this is about and
10:27
every month you see a place or a being
10:30
that is in heaven
10:31
and i'll show you one more and uh
10:34
but we have special days we put in here
10:37
we put some of our own days in here
10:39
what is not in here is satan's holiday
10:42
you won't see that okay we're not giving
10:43
him any place whatsoever
10:45
uh and so let me find one of the other
10:48
places there's so many i want to show
10:50
you
10:50
this is just awesome and most of these
10:53
places were places i personally was
10:55
taken to in heaven
10:57
here's one of somebody going home to
10:59
heaven
11:00
this is called the transport and this
11:04
woman
11:04
who you can see standing there with the
11:06
red hair she was 90 in her 90s
11:09
when she passed and when she stepped her
11:11
spiritual body stepped out of her body
11:13
this is what she
11:14
looked like young and happy she's very
11:17
happy
11:17
those are her two guardian angels about
11:19
to take her home to heaven
11:22
and then over here you'll find an
11:24
explanation at the bottom of the picture
11:26
over here you'll find an explanation
11:28
of what this picture is about so you you
11:30
get understanding not just
11:32
images and then like i said and at the
11:35
bottom of every month
11:37
we have a declaration that we make
11:40
like here this one says heaven
11:41
celebrates each time a believer comes
11:43
home
11:44
so you get this at the end of each
11:46
calendar month
11:47
we make a declaration like that for you
11:49
so it's very exciting you will see
11:51
places in heaven you never even dreamed
11:54
were there
11:55
we do still have some left but the
11:57
reason people want them
11:59
is because we have interactive days like
12:01
we have a day we said
12:02
uh tell people you know show us with you
12:05
wearing angel wings
12:07
and that was one of the days and but you
12:10
have to use the
12:11
email email address that is on the
12:14
calendar
12:15
for those interactive things we do still
12:17
have some left
12:18
so maybe for the next month or so we'll
12:21
have some
12:22
so you can find them on
12:24
revealingheaven.com
12:25
go to our website click on the store and
12:28
you'll see this calendar
12:30
there uh we are already in the in the
12:33
we are already right now creating to the
12:35
2021 calendar
12:37
and the one before this one which was
12:39
2019
12:40
was about the host of heaven we we
12:43
revealed
12:44
and introduced heaven's army
12:47
into the earth because the father had
12:49
asked us to do that
12:50
and so there's many other things in here
12:53
i'll show you one more this is called
12:55
the hall of knowledge
12:57
i'm not the only one who's been there
12:59
there's these beautiful towers made out
13:01
of emerald like they look like emerald
13:03
glass
13:04
you ride on roads of light through these
13:07
towers and that you can learn all kinds
13:10
of different things
13:11
the books actually show you the book
13:14
you would take the book out of the niche
13:16
and you lay it on this little table and
13:18
it opens up and shows you like a movie
13:20
of what's in the book
13:21
this is heaven this is not the earth so
13:25
if you're interested make sure you go to
13:27
revealingheaven.com you can ask for
13:30
on the web store on the web store and
13:32
then you can find the world called
13:34
heaven calendar
13:34
and they need to click on the correct
13:36
link that pertains to
13:38
where they live there's a link for
13:41
canada there's a link for the us and
13:44
then there's a link for all other
13:45
countries
13:47
because you know we ship internationally
13:49
around the world and they have different
13:51
costs for different um for shipping
13:54
and so that's why it's important you
13:56
click on the right one so your calendar
13:58
is not sent to the wrong country
14:00
and so there you go there's a little bit
14:02
of information from a question that we
14:04
got so what do you have next jen
14:06
um i have a question from eagle
14:09
eagle and um
14:13
they asked can our loved ones visit us
14:16
in our dreams how can our loved ones
14:20
visit us in our dreams the loved ones
14:22
from heaven eyes and right
14:23
yes that happens to many people
14:27
people have very vivid dreams and
14:30
i would have to say absolutely that does
14:32
happen
14:34
god speaks to people and visions and
14:37
dreams it says so in the bible
14:39
so that is possible for you to have a
14:42
dream
14:43
or even a vision of your loved one in
14:45
heaven
14:47
and actually some people have been
14:48
caught up to heaven while they were
14:50
sleeping and didn't realize that
14:52
and they have very vivid dreams of being
14:54
in heaven with their loved ones so
14:56
you know with god those things are
14:58
possible but absolutely
15:00
that is possible for that to happen and
15:02
sometimes it will happen like right
15:04
after somebody passes away
15:06
um i've heard of some people just
15:08
appearing briefly
15:10
in the room and waving sometimes they
15:12
don't say anything sometimes they just
15:14
say
15:14
i want you know i'm okay or i love you
15:17
and
15:18
i think that depends on getting
15:20
permission from the father
15:21
for them to get permission from the
15:22
father to do that i know people are so
15:25
undone
15:26
and overwhelmed when they first get to
15:27
heaven their whole head and heart is
15:29
just trying to take
15:31
in that glorious place of splendor
15:34
in heaven and of course the
15:36
relationships they have with people they
15:38
are
15:38
meeting the father and the son and holy
15:41
spirit just seeing the beauty that's
15:43
there
15:43
the things you prepare for them their
15:45
own mansion
15:46
they're just getting undone it's like
15:48
one gift every time they go somewhere
15:50
else it's something beautiful
15:52
but yes i do believe it's possible to
15:54
have dreams and visions
15:55
okay um i found this question
15:59
almost quite well not really humorous so
16:01
it's it's a good one
16:03
it's from dawn and she said cat do
16:05
angels ever
16:06
mess up like when someone gets in an
16:09
accident or something
16:11
is that them maybe not paying attention
16:14
or slacking off on their job
16:15
lol just always wondered about that
16:18
i don't think it's about an angel if an
16:21
angel messed up
16:22
it wouldn't be something to do with
16:23
rescuing somebody
16:25
or protecting somebody i think
16:28
so many different circumstances issues
16:31
in our own lives
16:32
you know the enemy will try to attack
16:35
anywhere that he
16:36
can make sure you're declaring and
16:38
decreeing against that happening make
16:40
sure that you're
16:40
involving the army of heaven in your
16:43
life um
16:44
make sure there's all kinds of things so
16:46
i have to say for sure
16:48
angels don't mess up on something that
16:50
would be that important
16:51
they probably you know you have to
16:53
realize these are real these beings have
16:55
real personalities like you and i
16:57
they all have souls they all have
16:59
emotions
17:00
and so i think sometimes maybe they're
17:03
not quite getting along
17:04
especially on an assignment i think they
17:06
would get maybe a harder assignment
17:08
given to them
17:10
i do know sometimes that does happen i
17:12
don't know how often but
17:13
like i said some people have stronger
17:16
personalities some
17:18
have really fun personalities i know
17:20
that there's some angels that are almost
17:22
like comedians and there's
17:23
others who are very focused and fierce
17:25
against the enemy
17:27
and that whatever their personality is
17:29
that that's definitely going to come out
17:30
in their assignments that god gives them
17:32
of course they're answerable to him the
17:34
thing about being an angel is
17:36
nothing is hidden god definitely knows
17:39
everything that's going on with them and
17:40
they live with him
17:41
so i think he has to handle that stuff
17:45
and i know um we always have new people
17:47
that come in
17:48
or people that haven't heard you talk
17:50
about stuff and people who've heard you
17:52
say
17:52
this stuff a million times but it's like
17:56
certain people need to hear it and i
17:58
really feel like
17:59
um i want to ask this question this is
18:02
from pam
18:03
and she said you may have addressed this
18:05
already please forgive me if it's a
18:07
redundant
18:08
i am a nurse you've mentioned we
18:11
will do the same work in heaven
18:14
there isn't any sickness or lack in
18:17
heaven
18:18
we all that um i know
18:21
i've done on earth uh
18:24
let's see what will i do for papa god if
18:27
my job
18:28
won't be needed well it's not your job
18:32
it's not your job that you do in heaven
18:34
nobody has a job it says actually says
18:36
you labor no more
18:38
what you do for a living is not what
18:41
you'll be doing in heaven
18:42
unless you've been using the gift he put
18:44
in you let's say someone who's a
18:46
recording artist and they're singing and
18:48
they're so anointed
18:49
they will be doing that in heaven but
18:51
they'll be doing it for everybody in
18:53
heaven for free
18:55
so it's probably your hobby or something
18:58
that is your passion
18:59
uh maybe even though you were a nurse
19:01
and you took care of people of course
19:03
there is absolutely no sickness in
19:04
heaven whatsoever
19:06
they don't need lawyers doctors nurses
19:08
there's all kinds of things they just
19:10
don't need them in heaven because that
19:11
stuff doesn't exist there
19:12
but somewhere in you he put a natural
19:15
gift
19:17
not a job okay those are skills i'm not
19:20
talking even about skills skills can be
19:23
learned but a gift is something he puts
19:25
in you and that's the thing you love to
19:27
do the most that's how you can tell what
19:29
it is
19:30
it says every good and perfect gift
19:33
comes down from the father of lights
19:36
that would be you
19:37
and when he made you in your little
19:39
spirit man
19:40
he placed in that spirit man a gift
19:44
whether it is an artist whether it is a
19:46
dancer whether you're going to sing
19:48
whether you're going to grow the best
19:49
flowers ever
19:51
whether you're gonna make the best i
19:52
don't know chimichangas
19:54
uh donuts whatever it is the culinary
19:57
arts
19:57
are absolutely i don't know where that
19:59
came from somebody probably likes them
20:01
i don't like them whatever whatever okay
20:05
baker's bakers are loved in heaven
20:08
because let me tell you
20:09
he gives you your own shop everything
20:11
you make it all make all the wonderful
20:13
stuff there's no gluten free
20:15
no weight gain i can just go on and on
20:17
yeah none of this stuff
20:18
you don't have to have keto you don't
20:21
have to eat keto
20:22
stuff at the same time and so they're
20:24
let me tell you there's fried chicken
20:25
there's pizza i've been to a pizza
20:27
parlor and haven't
20:28
had ice cream cones and everyone that's
20:30
their gift because that was their
20:32
passion on the earth and they knew that
20:35
it says your gifts and your callings are
20:38
without repentance and he will not
20:40
take irrevocable means he'll never take
20:42
it away that means if he put in you to
20:44
be an
20:45
artist yes and maybe you never actually
20:47
had a gallery or anything like that but
20:49
maybe all you want to do is sketch
20:51
you're a great sketch artist maybe you
20:53
you understand colors and stuff like
20:55
that
20:56
maybe you want to make pottery with your
20:57
hands but you don't do that for a living
20:59
but it's your
20:59
passion that's your gift it's what your
21:02
passion is maybe it was a drummer
21:06
and one grandson he started drumming on
21:07
everything before he was a year old we
21:09
knew he was going to be a drummer guess
21:11
what he still loves it
21:12
that's his gift when he goes to heaven
21:14
one day he'll be a drummer
21:16
that's not a job you don't have to labor
21:19
it's not something that you don't like
21:21
it's not something that's hard it's like
21:24
breathing you
21:25
love it so much so guess what and all
21:27
that i do
21:28
and all that jen does we are
21:30
photographers
21:32
my gift is i'm not going to be a
21:34
revelator in heaven okay i'm not going
21:35
to be a prophet in heaven
21:37
i'm not going to be those things i'm not
21:39
going to be any minister i'm not going
21:40
to do that i will be a photographer why
21:43
because i love it it is my passion from
21:46
the time i was little i'd make fake
21:48
little cameras with a box
21:49
and pretend i was taking pictures until
21:51
i got my first camera
21:53
and i have never stopped loving it i
21:55
already know in heaven i'll have a
21:57
studio come by and see me one day when
21:59
you get there
22:00
i'll take your pictures for free and
22:02
create beautiful stuff out of that
22:04
so that's what you'll do whatever your
22:07
hobby is
22:08
whatever your passion is it's in there
22:11
somewhere that's what you will be and
22:13
all your property will be designed
22:15
that's why there's amusement parks
22:17
there's rodeos there's all kinds of
22:19
wonderful fun things there
22:21
and every time someone comes home to
22:23
heaven there's something new and
22:25
exciting
22:26
to do but they're not working they're
22:28
not laboring
22:29
it is the most fun they've ever had in
22:32
their life so there that's a good answer
22:34
for those people
22:35
who don't know they keep sitting on the
22:36
pew their church this is what god says
22:39
all my people keep sitting on the pew of
22:40
their church trying to figure out what
22:41
their spiritual gift is and yet the
22:43
thing i want them to know the most
22:45
is what is their natural gift that i
22:48
made them
22:49
when i sent them to the earth because
22:51
when you get home to heaven
22:52
that'll be the most exciting thing you
22:54
do there yep
22:55
okay one more what's one more okay um
23:01
i've been screen shotting questions okay
23:04
um
23:05
back to uh the when you were talking
23:08
about the angels
23:09
um this one person didn't quite
23:11
understand her
23:12
her name is i want to say remy
23:16
home um she said how could they not get
23:19
along
23:20
there is no evil in the angels so i
23:23
guess she does she thinks they fight
23:25
no no no i'm not talking about fighting
23:27
like evil there is no evil there is no
23:29
hate
23:30
they don't do that in heaven but they
23:32
have personalities everybody has a
23:35
personality
23:36
okay and you have to understand angels
23:38
are spiritual beings
23:40
we're physical beings okay we both have
23:43
a soul
23:44
but we have to make our we all get to
23:46
make our own decisions
23:48
because you're a believer and you're
23:50
going to heaven doesn't mean you
23:51
always you don't ever have disagreements
23:54
with people
23:55
okay there is no anger no coveting
23:58
there's no jealousy in heaven
24:00
there's no wrath nobody fights nobody
24:03
hits somebody nobody does things
24:04
spiteful i'm not talking about that kind
24:06
of stuff
24:07
i forget sometimes to relate things my
24:10
answers to
24:11
heaven culture and not earth culture so
24:15
your mind is thinking
24:16
earth culture earth atmosphere earth
24:20
living
24:20
it's not like that in heaven but not
24:23
everybody wants the same thing even in
24:25
heaven but they still agree
24:27
to enjoy their self to have fun you
24:30
still have your favorite things your
24:31
favorite colors in heaven
24:33
that god doesn't take all that away from
24:34
you but there is no anger no wrath no
24:37
hating no spitefulness no coveting
24:39
there's no offense that part
24:43
that part of your your flesh emotions
24:46
because right now we're spirit man but
24:48
we still have our flesh when he talks
24:50
about your flesh lay down your flesh
24:52
right
24:53
that's not talking about you dying as a
24:56
person that's talking about your
24:57
opinions your rights your attitudes
25:00
your anger issues that's the flesh
25:03
that stuff is not there but people still
25:06
have their personalities their likes or
25:08
dislikes
25:09
and sometimes when angels are sent on
25:11
assignment god on purpose and this is
25:13
why he does it there's no marriage
25:15
between the angels they don't get
25:17
married on this earth we get married and
25:19
one of the things that he does with
25:20
marriages
25:21
sharpens the husband and wife that
25:23
doesn't mean
25:24
get you angry enough that you divorce
25:26
but it stretches us
25:28
right it makes us to come into agreement
25:30
on different things sometimes you know
25:32
we have to give a little
25:33
take to get you know we have to come
25:36
together in agreement
25:38
even as husband and wife but it
25:39
stretches it says
25:41
steal sharpen steel that's what happens
25:43
when you're married you sharpen each
25:45
other
25:46
you make each other care more understand
25:48
things aren't going to be perfect but
25:49
you're
25:50
you're willing to work it out in heaven
25:52
they don't have that so god has another
25:54
way that the angels get
25:56
stretched right and he sends different
25:59
personalities on assignment and i happen
26:02
to know this is true because two that
26:03
were assigned to me for a while
26:05
one was a comedian the other one was so
26:07
fierce
26:08
against darkness he wanted to talk about
26:10
being holy he wanted to talk about
26:12
crushing the enemy
26:13
that would be satan his plans the other
26:15
one wanted to make jokes because he was
26:17
funny
26:18
his personality was totally opposite of
26:20
the southern angels they
26:21
stretched each other every time they
26:24
were
26:24
with me they didn't get angry each other
26:27
so forget about the anger thing that's
26:29
earth thinking but angels have
26:32
personalities in heaven
26:33
and they like many different things and
26:36
they have friends amongst each other no
26:38
romance
26:39
okay they don't happen in heaven um the
26:41
angels who fell
26:42
tried that it didn't work so that's what
26:45
i'm talking about when i said you know
26:46
it's not like
26:47
your flesh getting involved i'm talking
26:49
about on the earth
26:50
when you loosen stuff from your soul get
26:53
grace for that day
26:54
and you work through your things you
26:56
don't get offended
26:58
you don't get in wrath um because
27:01
we have help from heaven okay one more
27:04
next question angel question and then i
27:06
have a question i have a 13 year old
27:08
um wow melissa wants to know
27:12
do we have the same guardian angel our
27:14
whole life
27:16
yes you have the same guardian angel
27:18
your entire life at the time you are
27:20
conceived
27:22
when life begins life doesn't begin when
27:24
a baby's born
27:26
life begins the time of conception and
27:29
from that moment your angel your
27:31
guardian angel or angels are sent from
27:33
heaven
27:34
they are will you your entire life
27:37
they are the ones who help bring you
27:40
home to heaven
27:41
when your body dies and your spiritual
27:43
body steps
27:44
out the first one you will see normally
27:47
will be your guardian angels and they
27:48
escort you home in a transport
27:51
all different ways you can be taken
27:52
chariots you can be taken to heaven
27:54
they will be with you the whole time
27:57
awesome okay
27:58
um charity's 13 year old daughter
28:01
her name is i want to say lyanna
28:06
but she would like to know can we ever
28:08
get kicked out of heaven
28:10
no but he's going to get kicked out of
28:12
heaven that only happened once and that
28:14
would be satan and all the angels
28:16
who fell with him they were the only
28:18
ones who'd been kicked out of heaven all
28:19
right they decided to go against god to
28:21
try to take over heaven
28:23
that was a long time ago and so he was
28:27
one third of all the angels in heaven
28:30
how about that that's crazy
28:31
chose satan chose lucifer
28:35
as their new leader and they all got
28:37
kicked out but
28:38
no one who goes there you're not going
28:40
to get kicked out of heaven okay
28:43
when you step out of your physical body
28:46
with your spiritual body
28:47
you already whatever things whatever
28:50
issues you had
28:52
whether it was anger against somebody or
28:54
you had
28:55
issues maybe you didn't even like
28:56
yourself all
28:58
that is gone okay those things you don't
29:01
carry up to heaven
29:03
the people you cared about the gifts he
29:06
put in you to use
29:07
that stuff remains with you and
29:09
excitement adventure
29:11
and all kinds of wonderful things are in
29:13
heaven but
29:14
you can't get kicked out of heaven
29:16
because when you receive jesus christ as
29:18
your savior
29:19
all the stuff all the sins in you get
29:21
wiped away
29:22
like they never happen don't let the
29:25
enemy remind you of your sins if you
29:28
repented of them all right
29:29
now even god can remember them because
29:31
you told him that you were sorry for
29:33
them
29:34
and so i can assure you that no one's
29:36
going to get kicked out of heaven
29:39
okay and um this is another one you've
29:41
answered before but i love to hear you
29:42
talk about this
29:44
um erica's brother she didn't say what
29:46
his name was but
29:48
he wants to know if there is hunting
29:51
in heaven this is a fun answer actually
29:56
that's why i asked it i think you know
29:58
jen knows a lot because she's heard
30:00
so many probably she's probably heard
30:02
every single time i went to heaven
30:04
and for those of you who don't know me
30:06
yes god has never stopped catching me up
30:07
to heaven yes he can do that because he
30:09
wants to no i don't choose to go myself
30:11
this is all free for all of you so you
30:13
understand
30:14
god caught people up to heaven in the
30:16
old testament
30:18
it says so he caught people up to heaven
30:20
in the new testament
30:22
without dying and he still does that
30:25
because he chooses to
30:26
and so she knows just about every time
30:28
he caught me up not in this physical
30:30
body it would stay behind you catch me
30:32
my spirit man my spiritual body that
30:34
looked just like me
30:36
but a lot better and so what was the
30:38
question
30:40
erica's brother now if there's hunting
30:44
in heaven
30:44
is there hunting in heaven you'd be
30:46
surprised what god has
30:48
uh has in heaven but it's the way he
30:51
does it this different
30:53
okay almost everything we have on the
30:54
earth is in heaven
30:56
except there's no killing no no harm
30:59
nobody gets injured uh none of that
31:02
happens in heaven okay
31:04
so um
31:09
i'm getting distracted today
31:13
is there like are you seeing angels
31:16
well there are angels all over in here
31:17
right now okay of course i could get
31:19
distracted just by the one that's behind
31:21
me and the one who's
31:22
two on here the one standing by you the
31:24
one standing by chris okay the one's
31:26
sticking their heads with the ceiling
31:28
looking down
31:29
and the ones looking through i'm gonna
31:30
figure
31:35
oh yes because you know i don't really
31:37
want to hunt
31:39
maybe well no we won't say that i don't
31:42
hunt i don't want to hurt anything
31:44
maybe mosquitoes there's hunting in
31:46
heaven
31:47
but this is the way god does it because
31:49
nothing gets killed remember what i said
31:52
no creatures are killed all animals are
31:55
called creatures in heaven
31:56
they all talk they all have actually uh
32:00
amazing personalities but you do go to
32:04
the mountain of spices that actually
32:06
exist in heaven
32:07
and what you do is a camera shoot
32:11
you're capturing the image and they
32:14
actually have a clubhouse in this whole
32:16
place
32:17
and you will be hunted by the creatures
32:21
with their own cameras while you're
32:22
hunting
32:23
them and your goal when you get to
32:26
heaven is to be the first one to get
32:28
their picture which is sent back to this
32:30
huge clubhouse with like a 40-50 foot
32:33
screen
32:34
and down in the corner is the one who
32:35
captured you and on the screen is the
32:37
one that was captured
32:39
and so all these people i actually saw
32:42
people in heaven doing that
32:43
they had you know pack horses and they
32:45
were packing all their camera equipment
32:47
on these horses
32:49
they even have different type cameras
32:52
that look like sort of like a scope
32:54
thing and when you
32:56
some of these creatures are not anywhere
32:57
on the earth by the way so you're really
32:59
hunting something that's fantastic
33:01
but more times than not
33:04
when you get back to the clubhouse you
33:06
will see your face plastered all over
33:08
the big screen
33:10
and in the corner will be the creature
33:11
who captured you
33:13
by getting that picture first so it's
33:16
very intense because while you're
33:18
hunting to find the creatures to get
33:20
their pictures
33:21
it's a camera shoot remember you're not
33:23
gonna hurt anything but
33:25
how intense is that
33:28
hunting process when you're looking for
33:31
something that's never been seen before
33:33
and yet they're probably smarter than
33:35
you they hide to you
33:37
and they get you first when you go back
33:40
thinking wow i know i snapped that
33:41
picture
33:42
and you walk in the clubhouse and
33:43
there's your face plastered all over
33:46
you know that you were busted and you
33:48
were caught
33:49
not them but the intensity and
33:51
excitement even increases more so in
33:54
heaven
33:54
but nobody gets hurt or harmed and no
33:57
life is taken
33:58
so you will still get to do that
34:01
try your best if you can when you get
34:03
there
34:04
okay i have a um another question you've
34:07
talked about before
34:08
but um holy spirit really wants me to
34:10
ask this so
34:11
um do aborted babies and babies in
34:14
general
34:15
have their own mansions especially when
34:18
they grow up
34:19
or if not where do they live
34:22
i brought this everybody everyone
34:25
no matter who they are will eventually
34:28
have their own mansion
34:30
jesus said in my father's house that's a
34:33
world by the way just you understand
34:35
god's house is the world called heaven
34:37
bigger than our
34:38
galaxy and uh trust me there's plenty of
34:42
room for mansions
34:44
and when little babies go home to having
34:46
every baby
34:48
who dies passes leaves this earth with
34:51
however you want to say it whether
34:53
through abortion
34:53
miscarriage or because they were sick or
34:56
whatever if when they die
34:58
and they go home to heaven they will
35:00
know family members in heaven
35:02
uh they will grow very slowly uh we've
35:06
actually
35:06
know of people who when they were 40
35:09
years old died on the operating table
35:11
saw their seven-year-old son playing in
35:13
the streets of gold who died years
35:14
before that
35:16
but because they the the mother went in
35:18
her spiritual body
35:19
her son recognized him he still looked
35:22
seven years old
35:23
he was playing with friends on the
35:24
streets of gold and he recognized her
35:27
and actually told her you can't stay you
35:29
have to go back but god allowed her to
35:31
see her son
35:33
number one he was well and whole he was
35:35
happy
35:36
he was playing he had friends and his
35:39
mom
35:40
came back of course she survived her
35:42
operation
35:43
and for years her and her husband would
35:45
travel around the world and tell people
35:47
about the beauty and the love of god
35:49
that their child was still waiting on
35:51
them in heaven
35:52
now she's already home in heaven so when
35:54
the parent comes home
35:56
to the baby they actually get to take
35:58
the baby from the nurseries and i have a
36:00
picture
36:01
here's one of the nursery walls that i
36:03
saw in heaven right here
36:07
and i gotta make sure that the lights
36:09
not reflecting tilt it down
36:12
oh here yeah there we go
36:15
that's good if you can see that these
36:17
are some of the babies beds that were on
36:19
this nursery wall i saw now they weren't
36:21
sleeping
36:22
babies don't have to sleep in heaven but
36:24
they have these beautiful
36:26
like a little niche these are little
36:27
tiny babies most of them
36:29
and the angels give them a nickname
36:32
unless the parents have named them
36:34
and they grow so slowly birds come in
36:37
and the birds take them for rides around
36:40
heaven
36:41
all kinds of fun things for them to do
36:42
they can sing laugh
36:44
dance and god has this beautiful place
36:47
for them
36:48
and they will be there until either the
36:50
grandparents come home or somebody close
36:53
to that baby in
36:54
relation they get to take them and keep
36:56
them to the parents get there
36:57
the parents take turns raising them and
37:00
eventually
37:01
they grow they step into the gift
37:04
remember we talked about gifts they each
37:06
have a gift
37:07
whether it could be anything designing
37:10
um
37:10
it could be like music it could be art
37:12
it could be dance it could be culinary
37:14
arts
37:15
it could be creating all kinds of gifts
37:17
and things for people
37:18
making things out of gems i know they
37:20
have jewelers and things in heaven
37:21
whatever their natural gift is
37:23
they'll still use that in heaven they'll
37:25
step into their gift and eventually
37:27
they will have their own mansion when we
37:29
come home to heaven we come home as
37:31
god's son
37:32
or daughter and all those babies will be
37:35
growing in the most beautiful amazing
37:37
place
37:38
loved by jesus himself and fun places
37:41
that he made for them so
37:43
your babies know who you are they
37:46
definitely can't wait for you to get to
37:47
heaven so that was beautiful you brought
37:49
that jen
37:50
okay um this question is
37:53
from jan vincent and he wants to know
37:58
if you can practice christianity and
38:01
witchcraft
38:02
no and what if you
38:05
you cannot claims that he pray for
38:08
people and heal people with jesus name
38:10
but yet also do witchcraft stuff
38:12
i will tell you what the bible says
38:14
there'll be some people who go there one
38:15
day and jesus will say depart from me i
38:18
never knew you
38:19
you cannot practice evil and
38:23
say you are a believer too you cannot do
38:25
both
38:26
when you become when you practice
38:28
witchcraft you're partnering with satan
38:31
even the bible talks about that it was
38:33
called necromancing
38:35
in the bible and it's all evil it
38:38
belongs to
38:39
satan witchcraft controls and i know
38:42
that one day they'll actually be
38:43
people that are called themselves good
38:45
witches there is no good witch
38:47
and i've heard from some of them myself
38:49
and let me tell you when you partner
38:51
with satan
38:52
he will lie to you deceive you but you
38:55
cannot you have to choose one or the
38:57
other
38:58
because christianity you believe in
39:00
jesus christ as your savior he does
39:02
not tolerate witchcraft he never
39:05
practiced witchcraft he spoke against
39:07
witchcraft
39:08
even himself in the new testament so
39:10
it's wrong it belongs to the enemy
39:13
and this is a thing people will get
39:15
healed in the name of jesus
39:17
it's jesus's name healing them but that
39:20
doesn't mean
39:20
they get reward for that and the bible
39:22
says will be people who come before god
39:25
there's also people who say they're a
39:26
christian but they sin
39:28
in bad ways they sin but they go hold
39:32
meetings people get saved
39:34
they'll get healed they may get words
39:36
from god
39:37
because that doesn't stop operating you
39:40
the way you choose your own life to live
39:42
and what you personally choose
39:44
yourself will be demonstrated by the way
39:47
you live your life that means you can't
39:49
be a witch and you can't belong to jesus
39:51
you have to choose
39:52
okay because when you die
39:56
whoever owns you or you serve
39:59
will come to get you and if you're
40:02
practicing witchcraft that gives the
40:03
enemy the right to come and get you when
40:05
you die
40:06
so i would not mess around with that get
40:08
witchcraft out of your life
40:10
i pray for people to be delivered from
40:12
witchcraft spirits
40:13
that doesn't come from god so don't play
40:16
around
40:16
don't read books on witchcraft don't go
40:18
see movies about witchcraft
40:20
you're opening a door in your soul for
40:22
the enemy to begin to control
40:24
you and these people who think they can
40:26
be do both
40:27
are under a great deception
40:30
so i'm just saying there's evil people
40:33
people who are doing wrong
40:34
sinning but going and having meetings
40:36
people come they get
40:38
saved by the name of jesus they get
40:39
healed by the name of jesus they get
40:41
worse because the holy spirit is going
40:42
to speak to those people
40:44
it isn't that person okay don't follow
40:47
people who you know
40:48
are sinning don't do it because you
40:52
follow jesus christ those who believe
40:54
the word of god and live the word of god
40:56
there's double accountability for
40:58
leaders and so he will hold them doubly
41:00
accountable but it says one day when
41:02
they come before him
41:03
and want the reward there will not only
41:05
be no reward he will not
41:07
allow them to remain okay
41:10
so you can't you can't do evil and do
41:13
god you have to choose god you cannot
41:16
have evil in your life
41:18
and witchcraft is one of those satanism
41:20
is witchcraft
41:22
any false religion don't try to practice
41:24
two religions at the same time
41:26
any witchcraft and you don't allow it in
41:28
you make sure you're running your race
41:30
to make a difference
41:31
for jesus christ it says for us to be
41:34
like him
41:36
he didn't practice any of that he
41:37
actually spoke against it
41:39
so those people are deceived there you
41:42
go
41:45
okay um this one's really long but i'm
41:47
not going to read the whole entire thing
41:49
and uh again you have discussed this but
41:53
um this is from charity um
41:56
herself and she says she has such a
41:58
struggle with being you know you can
42:00
share on this
42:01
experience i can share on this i
42:03
absolutely can share on this
42:05
and number one i want to let you know
42:06
this god does not approve of any
42:09
violence
42:10
no abuse okay no kind of abuse
42:12
whatsoever
42:13
whether it's physical abuse verbal abuse
42:16
god is against that
42:18
and and let me tell you this that he
42:21
would rather you be by yourself than be
42:23
with someone who's abusing you
42:25
i know that many spiritual leaders
42:27
through the years have said uh and it
42:30
can happen on both sides okay i'm not
42:32
saying i know women that were violence
42:33
and abuse their husbands and i know men
42:35
that were violent and abused their wives
42:37
it happened on both sides so you can't
42:39
say one is worse than the other
42:40
abuse is abuse okay uh but for instance
42:44
let's just say for instance
42:46
i had prayed for people before they were
42:47
under severe abuse
42:49
and this was a wife and she was abused
42:51
physically all the time and when she
42:53
went to her pastor they would say
42:55
you cannot leave your husband the bible
42:56
says you cannot do that
42:58
no that was not the right thing to say
43:00
to them okay god does not
43:02
put up with abuse he doesn't approve of
43:05
anybody abusing anybody you
43:07
certainly have the right to not be
43:08
abused and this is the thing
43:11
if it is sin let's just say it's sin
43:14
if we say it sin sins can be forgiven
43:17
if you divorced and it wasn't out of
43:20
abuse when you just divorced you didn't
43:21
want that person you
43:22
you divorced them you can go before god
43:25
and say i repent
43:26
of that that doesn't mean you have to go
43:28
back to the person you're already
43:29
divorced
43:29
your pen is wiped away sin is wiped away
43:33
people
43:34
you can't hold those sins against people
43:36
not even things they did 30 years ago
43:38
if they repented of those things then
43:40
god doesn't remember them anymore
43:43
and i happen to know myself personally
43:45
some people don't like me after i tell
43:47
them this
43:48
i went out and picked out somebody it
43:49
wasn't god's choice
43:52
this is what the bible says and god came
43:54
to me himself one day and i was abused
43:57
horribly uh when i was married to
43:59
somebody else and god came to me and
44:00
said how long are you going to put up
44:02
with that
44:03
and i said well what should i do about
44:04
it he said you have a contract you don't
44:06
have a covenant
44:08
he said my word says what god has joined
44:11
together
44:12
let not man put asunder what that means
44:16
is don't let man
44:17
end it he said if if god put it together
44:21
if it was god
44:22
who brought you together and then again
44:24
even if you did and you repented
44:26
for doing that later it's still forgiven
44:29
okay people don't like it when i say
44:30
that
44:31
sin is sin if you repent it's forgiven
44:34
no matter what kind of sin that is it's
44:36
it says that he remembers it no more
44:39
he's not going to treat you like a lower
44:41
human being
44:42
okay god's not going to do that i'm
44:44
still pursuing my destiny
44:46
i repented of that and uh god said end
44:49
the contract so we i got divorced
44:51
because god told me to
44:53
he said you'll never be who i need you
44:54
to be if you remain married to that
44:56
person i didn't bring you that person
44:57
that is not my choice
44:59
that's not a covenant a covenant is when
45:01
i bring you together
45:02
i didn't look for anyone god brought me
45:04
the husband i have now we've been
45:05
married 43 years
45:07
and let me tell you a marriage is a
45:09
trial
45:11
it's a trial it's a challenge because
45:13
you've got two individuals
45:15
coming together as one maybe you like
45:17
different things you do things different
45:19
ways make sure that you're marrying the
45:20
person god
45:21
has for you and even then there could be
45:24
conflict but make sure you're praying
45:26
for each other i'm just going to include
45:28
all this in this package that's not just
45:30
a yes or no thing
45:31
now yes or no abuse is as bad as
45:35
running around on your spouse it's still
45:38
abuse
45:39
that is mental abuse if you're married
45:41
and you go find someone else and sleep
45:43
with them and you you choose them
45:45
over your spouse and you're still
45:46
married and all this is going on
45:48
that is sin that is for sure sin but
45:50
it's abuse
45:52
god puts abuse in that same line that
45:55
says
45:56
that talks about adultery in that home
45:58
meaning
45:59
is severe abuse and that's what he
46:02
recognizes even in the bible
46:04
that you can be divorced if that happens
46:07
this is a very touchy question but i
46:08
don't mind answering it okay
46:11
i suffered a lot of abuse but put up
46:13
with it for six and a half years until
46:15
i finally said to god what do i do and
46:17
he said how long are you going to
46:18
tolerate it
46:20
i had to repent to the person i married
46:22
i didn't even love them i had to repent
46:24
to them
46:25
i'd repent for them that that had to be
46:26
ended because god had asked me to end it
46:29
so there was repentance on my side and
46:31
then god brought me the right person
46:33
and i married them because he said you
46:34
will marry this person
46:36
so people can fight and argue and yell
46:39
all you want to it's about
46:40
what you repent from if it was wrong
46:43
what you did it's been ended and it's
46:45
over
46:46
and maybe the other person is remarried
46:48
he certainly doesn't expect you to go
46:50
after them and make them remarry you
46:52
you repent for the whole situation give
46:54
yourself to god
46:56
and he probably most more than likely
46:58
will bring you
46:59
somebody else to be with you god doesn't
47:01
want us to be alone okay
47:03
and the reason why he has marriage is so
47:05
we don't have to go through this
47:07
life alone it says the marriage bed that
47:10
means you know what that means that
47:12
means a living together having physical
47:14
relations
47:14
when you're married god approves of that
47:17
when you're not married and you live
47:18
together and do that he does not approve
47:20
of that
47:21
and there's many reasons why because
47:22
when you come together
47:24
you're actually sharing your soul with
47:25
each other this is more than you ever
47:27
thought you were going to get this is
47:28
what happens when you ask the deep
47:29
questions okay
47:30
and the more of yourself you give when
47:32
you're married you're empowering each
47:34
other
47:35
but when you're not married and you're
47:36
sharing physical relations with each
47:38
other you're giving parts of your soul
47:40
away layers that you shouldn't be doing
47:41
that to someone you're not married to
47:44
so there's your whole story it's all
47:47
about
47:47
abiding in god married they're
47:49
christians and they marry someone who's
47:51
not it's a much
47:52
harder lifestyle if they don't want to
47:54
agree with what you're doing maybe
47:56
make sure you find that up before you
47:58
get married
47:59
but i can tell you that if anyone
48:02
repents
48:03
they are forgiven and you can't drag
48:06
that stuff up and throw it back in their
48:08
face again
48:09
because what you that is then wrong okay
48:12
you have to forgive too
48:14
even it was something that was done to
48:15
you that that unforgiveness will hurt
48:18
you
48:18
worse than what you experienced before
48:20
in your life
48:21
get rid of all unforgiveness and all
48:23
offense
48:25
no matter what it was and you run your
48:28
race
48:28
and let god bless you and so there's
48:31
that very long answer about that
48:33
question but god
48:34
doesn't tolerate abuse in any marriage
48:37
no physical abuse no mental or emotional
48:40
abuse
48:41
that beats you up until you feel like
48:43
you're nothing at all
48:44
he doesn't want you to stay in a
48:46
situation like that okay he doesn't
48:49
and so uh pray let god open doors of
48:52
safety for you
48:53
and you seek him to see what you're
48:54
supposed to do next
48:56
but he does love you there you go
49:02
so um somebody actually asked me a
49:04
question
49:05
oh wow jen what did they ask you they
49:08
wanted to know if i've ever been to
49:11
heaven
49:12
okay so come over here and say thank me
49:16
if they ask you then you give them their
49:18
answer
49:19
hey
49:22
i'm kind of in my gym clothes still it's
49:24
okay everybody looks like that right now
49:27
anyway so i've never
49:30
been to heaven but i have had um
49:34
three open visions uh during the time
49:38
that i was writing the
49:39
the first children's book and well two
49:42
times were with the first children's
49:43
book
49:44
and then the third time was during the
49:46
well
49:47
well i've been writing the second but he
49:49
did something special for you didn't he
49:51
yes um when i was writing the first book
49:55
i wrote one sentence down and i was in
49:58
my office and my whole office went black
50:00
and then my wall kind of opened up like
50:03
a movie screen
50:04
and i it was like i was seeing
50:07
the book come alive so it was all in
50:11
cartoon
50:12
form every time i've ever had an open
50:15
vision about heaven it's been in cartoon
50:17
form that's cool
50:18
and so i was seeing the characters in
50:20
the book and
50:21
walking down the streets of gold and um
50:24
one of the times
50:25
that that happened they were going into
50:28
the amusement park which
50:29
kat talks about in her first book and i
50:32
was seeing all kinds of things
50:34
um and things that i had never heard her
50:37
talk about and so it was like i was
50:40
walking with them
50:42
i didn't see myself on the path but i
50:44
knew i was walking with them seeing my
50:45
characters walking down the streets of
50:47
gold and
50:48
going into the amusement park and one of
50:51
the things that really fascinated me
50:53
which is going to be in the first kids
50:55
book is
50:56
i saw a merry-go-round and instead of
51:01
uh the horses that you sit on there are
51:04
actual
51:04
live animals and they were whole the the
51:08
people
51:08
children adults and there were even some
51:11
animals writing on there so it looks
51:12
like
51:13
animals it was quite funny um but they
51:16
were riding on the backs and they had
51:18
rains
51:18
and then instead of their little
51:20
platform yeah instead of a pole
51:22
being down the middle um they were on a
51:24
platform that would go up and down
51:27
and i had never heard her talk about i
51:29
didn't know that and so
51:30
i was so excited it went in when the
51:33
vision was over i come running out of my
51:35
office to tell her what i saw and
51:37
and she's like yeah that's up there so
51:40
um and there were other things that i
51:41
saw
51:42
too and what what were some of the well
51:44
or some of the animals you could write
51:45
on jen not what you would think
51:47
yes it is was
51:50
um dinosaurs there was even a whale
51:54
so apparently somebody had always wanted
51:55
to ride a whale i mean i guess it
51:57
it wasn't huge so it shrunk down to fit
52:00
on the merry-go-round but
52:01
there was a seahorse that didn't need
52:03
water to breathe no
52:04
it didn't it didn't and there was uh
52:07
jungle animals
52:08
uh you know like elephants and lions and
52:11
real ones
52:12
yeah real ones breathing ones and it was
52:14
really cool
52:15
and uh there was like a little raccoon
52:17
that was on the back
52:18
of i think it was like a hippo or
52:20
something it was so funny
52:22
but um yeah and they like lollipops
52:25
don't they
52:25
yes the raccoons like yeah yeah because
52:28
they even saw a raccoon riding on the
52:29
rush
52:33
yeah so that that was my experience and
52:35
it was it's happened three times now
52:37
yeah and uh so yeah that'd be awesome
52:41
yeah yeah that was a great answer i'm
52:43
back over here now
52:44
okay maybe a couple more questions so
52:47
that we can we do have a couple more
52:48
things
52:49
i have to do today but how much fun is
52:52
this to just have a
52:52
just a spontaneous q a session and now
52:55
you find out
52:56
some people can see heaven and cartoon
52:58
form that would be really cool
53:01
so oh let's see and so when you see like
53:05
you know
53:06
teal squirrels or or purple elephants
53:10
yes that exists in heaven everything is
53:13
different colors
53:14
in heaven i love when you talk about the
53:15
messenger squirrels
53:17
yes that we're talking the greeters the
53:19
breeders i've always called a messenger
53:21
squirrels
53:22
they're greeters they sing and dance
53:23
with top hats the squirrels when you
53:25
have a party somewhere in your home yes
53:27
people have
53:28
parties and they come to entertain and
53:30
they have top hats and canes and some of
53:32
the best dancers i've ever seen
53:34
and you you you just you know get home
53:37
and say hey we're having a party we'd
53:38
like for you to come do some
53:40
some of your performance you never know
53:42
what's going to happen up there it's
53:44
just great
53:46
so what would you say to someone who's
53:48
been praying and asking
53:50
to see jesus and angels and it hasn't
53:53
happened yet
53:54
i would say um stop praying and asking
53:57
and start thanking him
53:58
i'm real serious about that because it
54:01
happens at the most unexpected times and
54:04
it's usually
54:05
not when you're asking i'm just gonna
54:08
give you a free little tip
54:10
and many times it's not when you're
54:12
praying either
54:13
most of my encounters i have in heaven
54:15
is not when i'm praying
54:16
somewhere i'm not even reading my bible
54:19
i'm doing everyday stuff
54:21
and he catches me up and sometimes i'm
54:23
doing everyday stuff and then an angel
54:25
walk up
54:26
walk up and say something or i'll see
54:27
them doing things or
54:29
um so you have to just understand
54:33
you think if you don't get in some
54:34
spiritual position
54:37
of what you think would be proper then
54:40
it's not going to happen
54:41
jesus also visits me when i least expect
54:44
it
54:45
and so i would just say expect have an
54:47
expectancy
54:48
that is going to happen you know and i
54:51
you know maybe share to people i'm
54:52
expecting this to happen
54:54
and you'd be surprised how soon or
54:57
quickly it happens then
54:59
well i know the first time i saw an
55:00
angel which was
55:02
um um the one that was watching
55:07
uh ben do the shipping and receiving
55:10
yeah we've seen
55:11
i was working at my desk typing right
55:13
here in this room
55:15
and at the core of my eye i just see
55:17
this most radical looking angel
55:20
leaning he's just like like this
55:22
watching him
55:23
pack up the products to ship out and i
55:25
was like okay
55:27
and i just kept on typing
55:30
you know what even the angels love it
55:32
that we're sharing heaven and all of our
55:34
products
55:35
represent something about heaven or
55:37
living righteously or being dangerous
55:39
against hell
55:41
all of the products we put up for that
55:43
reason and we we do have mp3s now we
55:45
have dvds cds
55:47
mp3s we have photographs we have
55:50
artwork now we have calendars we have
55:53
cups we have all kinds of stuff we're
55:54
creating
55:56
um to to demonstrate and manifest heaven
56:00
like here's one of the cups right here i
56:01
have one
56:02
it says i don't do
56:06
demons and there's a little lightning
56:09
bolt representing when they were all
56:10
kicked out of heaven you know
56:12
then once you follow loose for that's
56:13
what that lightning bolt represents some
56:15
hell doesn't like it that we market
56:17
stuff like this because
56:19
it points fingers at them anyway so we
56:22
do all kinds of things so angels are
56:24
going to be present
56:25
even if you don't see them they're
56:26
present if you're speaking on behalf of
56:28
god
56:29
when you're praying they're there your
56:31
angels always there maybe turn around
56:33
every now and then say thank you for
56:34
watching over me
56:36
that's perfectly okay you're not sitting
56:37
down having tea with them however if god
56:39
allows it enjoy it
56:42
we're living in a different life and
56:44
time now and i know that before the end
56:46
does come which is generations away
56:49
it will be normal for you to see angels
56:51
in your home
56:52
and angels in your car outside your car
56:55
because they're there all the time i see
56:56
them
56:57
and i know more and more the spiritual
57:00
realm
57:00
and these are spiritual beings in the
57:02

57:10

57:11

57:14
even in the midst of everything else
57:16
god has his plans and so i would just
57:18
encourage you we'll probably take one
57:19
more question and that will be it for
57:21
today
57:22
and you never know when we're going to
57:23

57:29
time with us

57:32
love spontaneous spontaneous still
57:35
happens in heaven
57:36
okay okay and so uh well we'll
57:39
let jen um okay share one more question
57:42
um okay this might take a while but i
57:45
know we've discussed this before
57:48
that's okay someone wants to know i
57:51
don't i don't didn't see who
57:53
asked the question but someone wants to
57:54
know is the
57:56
virus the mark of the beast or the the
57:59
vaccine
57:59
the vaccine it's the mark of the beast
58:02
uh we we've had this long
58:04
conversation about this everything is
58:08
many years something comes up that is
58:11
the mark of the beast yes and i have
58:12
lived along with you and let me tell you
58:14
they were doing it back in the 50s
58:17
oh i was alive oh even mom it
58:20
my our mom who was born in the 30s she
58:22
was born in the 30s
58:24
they said even back then they were
58:25
saying that the rapture was coming
58:27
the rapture was coming you know you know
58:30
what he says about all that just so you
58:32
know
58:33
revelation 21 the very end of the bible
58:37
okay the very end of the bible there's
58:39
so much still
58:40
that has to happen the best of things
58:43
other than christ being born
58:45
him dying on the cross tearing up hell
58:48
wasting hell
58:49
okay those were amazing powerful things
58:51
the holy spirit coming
58:52
those were great times but we're
58:54
entering into some of the most powerful
58:56
exciting times as a believer
59:00
that's your life that's the what you
59:02
what's coming for your life
59:04
okay but i can tell you the mark of the
59:06
beast
59:07
is nowhere right now there's nothing
59:09
that's been created on the earth that
59:10
is the mark of the beast at all in any
59:13
way whatsoever
59:14
it isn't the michael chip oh no they
59:16
used to say the bar code okay when i was
59:18
going to the barcode
59:19
you're going to walk around with a bar
59:20
called this big on your head right that
59:22
was going to be the mark of the beast
59:24
this is the crazy thing i will say this
59:26
the mark
59:27
a mark is a visible mark you will see it
59:31
a visible permanent mark you will see it
59:33
with your eyes
59:34
it's not something hidden in your skin
59:36
it's not something that will happen
59:38
or a frequency that will be around no
59:40
it's not the 5g
59:41
it's not 5g people this is what god said
59:44
about 5g
59:45
that just means the gospel will go
59:47
further and stronger than ever before
59:50
around the world around the world which
59:52
is his purpose so don't look for the 5g
59:54
to be the mark of the beast that can't
59:56
even happen
59:56
okay the antichrist is not on the earth
59:59
the
60:00
spirit or the attitude or the nature
60:04
antichrist means anything that's against
60:06
christ himself
60:08
anything that speaks truth and hope is
60:11
and then that is the that is the truth
60:13
but anything that speaks against it
60:16
is an antichrist spirit jesus said even
60:18
now the antichrist spirit is in the
60:20
earth he didn't mean the person
60:22
he met the way it will operate he will
60:24
speak against
60:25
god the antichrist will be against jesus
60:28
christ
60:28
his holiness his sovereignty it will
60:31
speak
60:32
totally against all of that that that
60:35
stuff is going on but the antichrist
60:37
himself has not been born how about that
60:39
one people
60:40
he's not on the earth because he
60:41
couldn't operate in his fullness
60:43
with the body of christ taking authority
60:46
over the earth ruling and reigning on
60:47
christ
60:48
uh changing things speaking to things
60:51
it wouldn't be able to be here he
60:53
couldn't be here in the time when the
60:56
antichrist comes the whole world will be
60:58
falling apart
61:00
millions of people will be missing off
61:02
of the earth it will be a
61:03
horrible experience for people and he
61:06
will be
61:07
their their protector he will be their
61:10
savior the antichrist will have answers
61:12
for all that stuff
61:13
he's not here that stuff is not
61:16
happening
61:16
so no the mark of the beast is not out
61:19
here somewhere
61:20
but it will be a permanent visible mark
61:22
and satan will make sure people
61:24
want to take it back in the days of that
61:26
happening
61:27
and you will see it walking down the
61:29
street he can't force you to take it
61:31
people because it would defeat his
61:32
purpose
61:33
his purpose he wants to flaunt that
61:36
people want him and they they want him
61:38
to be there
61:40
so this is not the time for any of that
61:42
it's not the time of the four horses of
61:44
the apocalypse it's not the time for the
61:46
wormwood whatever to hit the earth
61:48
it isn't time for death and destruction
61:51
it isn't it is the time for the the
61:54
knowledge
61:55
and understanding and the operation of
61:57
the glory the power of god
62:00
seen going around the earth
62:03
in these days there's baptism in fire
62:05
that will burn all the fear out of you
62:07
all the world out of you okay
62:09
that has not happened yet okay the
62:11
manifested sons and daughters speaking
62:13
to earthquakes to make them stop and put
62:15
it back the way it was before it
62:16
happened or anybody died
62:18
that's a manifested son or daughter
62:20
raising the dead that were cremated
62:21
that's a manifested son or daughter are
62:23
you seeing that
62:24
it's not even happening but we have to
62:27
have this in the earth
62:28
because she said it would be here and
62:31
the wealth of the will
62:32
the wealth of the wicked has to be
62:33
transferred to the just and the
62:34
righteous
62:35
those things haven't even started
62:38
stop asking if the mark of the beast is
62:41
out there
62:41
stop asking if this is the end and
62:44
everything's going to crash and just be
62:45
blown away
62:47
it isn't and i have news for you the
62:49
earth won't even stop
62:50
being here until after the tribulation
62:54
is
62:54
over and it's done and gone they'll
62:57
still be natural people on the earth
62:59
jesus christ will sit on the throne in
63:01
jerusalem
63:02
for one thousand years when all of that
63:06
is
63:06
done and gone many of us will be in
63:09
heaven
63:09
okay and then the earth then jesus will
63:12
be king of the world for one thousand
63:14
years will be no wars no weapons will
63:16
even be used
63:17
saint will be in the bottomless pit just
63:20
falling
63:21
he will not even be on the earth
63:22
there'll be no evil on the earth at the
63:23
time there'll be people who don't want
63:25
christ
63:25
on the earth so you can see that even at
63:28
the end of this
63:29
age we're in which is still got quite a
63:32
few generations to it
63:34
the next age after this age will be the
63:36
millennial age so the earth will still
63:37
be here
63:38
it'll still be operating it says people
63:40
will still be getting married and being
63:42
given a marriage so don't try to make
63:45
god's will be pushed into a little box
63:49
of what people have told you it will be
63:51
this is not the last day
63:54
this is not the perilous times where you
63:56
can't build you can't eat there won't be
63:58
anything to do
64:00
you'll barely be able to breathe you
64:02
won't see blue sky
64:03
you won't even be here during that time
64:06
you are
64:06
here during some of the greatest days on
64:08
the earth and i'm just going to
64:10
end with this because it is so powerful
64:12
to understand god's timing
64:14
he has things in his own word he wrote
64:18
if they're still in some of the newer
64:20
bibles i hope they leave them in there
64:23
the perilous times have not happened the
64:25
tribulation has not happened
64:27
it will not happen for quite a long time
64:31
your focus is to know christ
64:34
to have an intimate relationship to
64:37
speak hope
64:38
life create things invent things
64:42
give people hope for a future not
64:46
demon gloom okay god himself the father
64:49
is the only one who decides when jesus
64:51
comes back and he is too busy ruling and
64:53
reigning with us
64:54
okay so look for greatness look for
64:57
god's plan for your life
64:59
run after it don't sit him on the curb
65:01
somewhere make sure he stays with you
65:04
no holy spirit and know that you
65:08
are chosen to be here now
65:12
you are not chosen for wrath we
65:15
as the body of christ have not been
65:17
appointed unto wrath
65:19
so we won't be here there will be people
65:22
saved during the times of the
65:23
tribulation
65:24
those are other people who were not
65:26
christians before that happened okay
65:29
you focus on what he wants right now
65:31
which is he wants you to be great for
65:33
him in the earth
65:35
bring hope and life watch your words
65:37
watch your choices
65:38
but live happy
65:41
make sure you have fun because heaven
65:44
is half fun and half powerful
65:48
it's so filled with splendor glory and
65:50
awe
65:51
of god fun as a weapon against fun
65:54
is a weapon when you're having fun the
65:56
enemy doesn't like it
65:58
so make sure you're using confusion too
66:00
yes it confuses his head
66:03
because he can't understand why he's not
66:04
keeping you crushed down
66:06
all right run after god himself
66:10
and let god take care of all the rest of
66:13
that stuff
66:13
don't look for the mark of the beast
66:15
it's not going to come in the letter
66:16
it's not going to come in an email
66:18
nobody can send it to you nobody can put
66:20
it on you
66:21
they can't force you to take it so
66:22
you're not even in the generation that
66:24
will be a part of that
66:26
that means you are here to do powerful
66:29
amazing things with him
66:30
let your faith build trust god
66:34
regardless of what's going on yes i've
66:36
been through hard things before my life
66:37
but i trusted him even when i had
66:39
nothing
66:40
i trusted him and believed his word and
66:43
i
66:43
told him i did bless his heart bless
66:47
your angels heart
66:48
by declaring the things of god it'll
66:51
change the atmosphere where you live
66:53
choose god choose life be powerful in
66:57
the earth for him and we will see you
66:59
later right jen

01:58

02:07
and he's going to work it and it's going
02:08
to be amazing
02:10
and i just want to add this about the
02:11
northwest did you not know
02:14
the places that are the most significant
02:16
to god are the ones that are attacked
02:18
the most by the enemy
02:20
and that's why satan wants to keep that
02:23
area dry because
02:24
it is like a wellspring i'm not just a
02:27
well but a wellspring
02:28
and i'm telling you god is going to
02:30
explode from that area and come
02:32
from that very corner of uh this country
02:35
and flood all over the place so
02:37
just stay excited everybody and don't
02:40
miss it don't miss this
02:41
event that's gonna happen wow that's
02:44
powerful because
02:46
uh you know you're talking about
02:47
wellsprings and really i want to talk
02:49
right now
02:50
about the wellsprings of revival i
02:51
believe we are in a season where god is
02:55
re-digging or digging up the old wells
02:57
like in the days of isaac
02:59
yeah and he's also digging up new wells
03:02
the old wells and the new wells and of
03:04
course right now
03:05
we're in the month of february it's it's
03:07
my favorite uh month of the year why
03:09
because it's my birthday month
03:11
so welcome to february everybody but of
03:14
course in this
03:15
month uh catherine coleman passed
03:19
uh billy graham pass john paul jackson
03:23
bob jones and paul kane so i really feel
03:25
like
03:26
kat and sherelle did this season god
03:29
wants us to dig
03:30
up the old wells and the new whales of
03:34
revival
03:34
in america because we're in a new season
03:37
now
03:38
i want to ask you miss cat what do you
03:40
think about that word
03:42
and what god's doing and digging up the
03:44
old wells
03:45
and the new wells right now well i do
03:47
know this
03:48
that he's definitely in a generational
03:50
thing right now
03:52
which means the generations of the past
03:54
and everything that they did
03:56
and made as a foundation is going to
03:58
explode
03:59
in this in the generations of this uh
04:02
time on the earth
04:03
and those who are alive on the earth
04:05
it's going to really it's going to
04:07
accelerate
04:08
everybody forward and upward and so yes
04:11
i definitely agree with that the things
04:12
that the people lay down their lives for
04:14
i love it that in the month of love
04:18
you know god took all those mighty men
04:21
and women home
04:22
and i actually knew bob jones would go
04:24
home the father told me the birth of
04:26
february and taking bob home on the 14th
04:28
and he said it's going to open up whole
04:30
new portals whole new gates
04:32
all over this nation and he said so
04:34
everybody needs to be excited
04:36
and you know but that was several years
04:37
ago but that doesn't matter god builds
04:39
on things he knew everything that would
04:42
happen and yet he's still gonna do
04:44
everything he wants but this is what
04:45
we'll have at the end
04:46
we will have great victory and great
04:49
celebration
04:51

04:54
reminded miss cats of again bob jones

05:07
of harvests and of course last year the
05:09

07:42
wow amen and amen absolutely i i feel
07:45
like right now
07:46
because of where our conversation's
07:48
going i feel like we need to talk about
07:51
what is god doing in this month of
07:52
february what is god going to do
07:56
in our country and in the nations of the
07:58
earth that i just feel such an
08:00
expectation and an anticipation
08:03
because february is going to be a mega
08:05
month of miracles
08:07
so let's talk about that right now and i
08:09
want to
08:10
pass to mike in the florida prophetess
08:12
sherelle what do you what do you sense
08:14
what do you expect
08:15
god to do in this month of february in
08:18
this season right now
08:20
well it's it just blew my mind that as
08:23
soon as you guys got on here you started
08:25
talking about
08:26
the wells of revival i don't know if you
08:28
guys
08:29
know about a prophetess named fuchsia
08:32
pickett
08:33
but she was a prophetess back here in
08:35
the 70s i believe
08:37
and she i was reading some of her book
08:39
last night and she was talking about how
08:42
wellsprings of revival were going to
08:45
burst up in certain areas of this
08:48
uh of washington and this area over here
08:52
and so
08:53
i began to see a vision when i was
08:56
reading that
08:57
and i saw the lord show me that there's
08:59
been like
09:00
holes of revival in the grounds of the
09:03
earth here
09:03
and some people have sown seeds of faith
09:06
and they've prayed and they've prepared
09:09
the way
09:10
and revival has come up to the surface
09:13
a couple times but man put his foot
09:17
on the coals man tried to stop the move
09:21
of the holy spirit and what the lord is
09:24
saying to me
09:25
about these next few months is that we
09:28
are going to be led by the spirit the
09:31
spirit
09:32
is going to lead us man is no longer
09:34
going to lead the spirit
09:36
and it's i'm i'm excited i just feel
09:39
like the holy spirit what the lord
09:41
showed me in 2017
09:44
he told me that the holy spirit will be
09:46
given a platform
09:48
and that's what we're seeing in this
09:49
season a place
09:52
that is cultivating revival by letting
09:55
the holy spirit
09:56
lead amen and you know just uh just to
10:00
piggyback on that you know
10:02
really the next three months i want you
10:05
to hear these words
10:06
because the next three months there's
10:08
going to be
10:09
monumental momentum that's going to take
10:12
place
10:13
from now passover i wish somebody heard
10:16
me today
10:17
from today february 1 to passover which
10:21
is of course in the middle of april
10:23
for the next three months there's going
10:24
to be mega momentum
10:26
monumental momentum that's going to
10:29
shift you
10:31
into harvest and into miracles so
10:33
there's going to be a lot of setup
10:35
for financial miracles miracles in your
10:38
business and even salvation
10:39
in your family but from now to passover
10:42
begin to prepare
10:44
because there's going to be mega setups
10:47
for your divine breakthrough
10:48
now before i pass the mic over uh to the
10:51
woman of god
10:52
cancur i just want to read the scripture
10:54
because we're talking about whales
10:56
because i believe god is springing up
10:59
wells right now in the spirit
11:01
genesis 26 18 isaac
11:04
reopened someone said reopened which
11:06
means it was closed but he opened up
11:08
again
11:09
isaac reopened the wells
11:12
that had been dug up in the time of his
11:15
father
11:15
abraham which the philistines ding ding
11:18
ding key were
11:19
philistines which are enemy opposing
11:22
giants
11:23
the giants of the land the giants of
11:27
welfare of poverty of socialism the
11:29
giants of
11:30
human trafficking of the elitist the
11:34
philistines had stopped the whales
11:37
after abraham died and so
11:41
right now these giants of the land of
11:43
201 are trying to
11:45
stop the wells or stop the flow of your
11:48
finances stop the flow
11:50
of the holy spirit stop the flow of
11:53
revival but
11:54
god wants to anoint you to dig
11:57
up and open up again what has been
12:00
closed
12:01
by these philistines these opposing
12:03
giants
12:04
and god's going to be doing it from
12:06
today february 1st all the way to
12:08
passover so you watch
12:10
god's about to open up miss cat what are
12:12
your thoughts here what do you want to
12:13
say to the people right now
12:15
i i have to say exactly what the father
12:18
is continually saying to me
12:20
don't we don't lose that um that spirit
12:24
of celebration
12:25
and maybe you don't know this people but
12:28
celebrating in heaven is
12:29
mainly what they do it's one of the ways
12:31
they worship god it's one of the ways
12:33
they
12:34
are are thankful and grateful to him for
12:36
all the things that they
12:37
that he did for us while we were on
12:39
earth and also once they get to heaven
12:41
and so they are celebrating in heaven
12:43
already and i do
12:44
know another prophet uh hank kuhneman
12:47
who always talks about
12:48
january february and march that leads
12:50
into april
12:51
and he is almost in line with what
12:53
you're saying he says that january will
12:55
begin to bring justice
12:57
february will be all the fireworks of
12:59
the beginning of everything happening
13:01
and then marching into the end of the
13:03
march will be great celebration and
13:05
miraculous
13:06
so uh that's what he has heard from god
13:08
i can tell you that i continually hear
13:11
that justice is already beginning to be
13:13
served and all the stuff that's going on
13:15
and just let me add what the father just
13:18
shared with me
13:19
yesterday about all the stuff going on
13:21
we know
13:22
that those who are now sitting in seats
13:25
of authority
13:26
are illegitimate that's what the father
13:28
says is illegitimate
13:30
power in other words not power given in
13:32
the natural
13:33
not power given in the spirit you know
13:35
the whoever is the head of a government
13:38
it says that when the righteous are in
13:40
power the people rejoice but when it's
13:42
the wicked and the evil are
13:44
that great the sadness comes upon them
13:46
well i need to remind
13:48
everybody that right now those who are
13:51
in authority don't have power not
13:53
real power which will be shown and
13:55
proven when that great victory comes
13:58
and god will shift back what his
14:00
intentions always were
14:02
and the truth is this the one who is in
14:04
true authority even
14:05
right now yeah which is trump
14:08
he is actually a president he did win
14:11
the election
14:12
and he is the one in authority still
14:14
welcoming god still having plans by the
14:16
way he's still getting ready to work
14:17
plans i just have to let you all know
14:19
that
14:20
and it's beginning to be no secret that
14:21
that's happening so there's a lot of
14:23
people
14:23
right now in dc very afraid demons are
14:27
leaving dc like crazy i mean they're
14:29
just leaving racing out of there
14:31
and this is what god said that is
14:33
because it's
14:34
illegitimate power so those who are
14:37
righteous right now
14:39
they are still in power they're the ones
14:41
in power
14:42
and what he says what our president says
14:44
the true president says
14:46
is what will affect this cup this
14:47
country not just in the natural
14:50
but in the spirit realm this is what the
14:52
father says
14:53
the wicked and evil trying to rule they
14:55
have no power
14:57
no true power so they have no right no
15:00
portals
15:00
open to them to allow evil to flood this
15:03
country like people think is happening
15:05
i'm sorry but the devil isn't going to
15:07
be taking over
15:08
because there's no true portal or
15:10
opening you have
15:12
for that to happen that is shut you
15:15
should be rejoicing everybody because
15:16
this is going to be an accelerated thing
15:18
that begins to happen
15:19
with the revival going into the
15:21
habitation of god in this
15:23
in this country and all over the world
15:25
actually so
15:26
these are celebrator times these are
15:29
victorious times
15:30
these are not times to be crushed and to
15:32
be sad and to have fear in you
15:34
about the only thing the devil's getting
15:36
away with is bringing fear
15:38
all those regulations and all those laws
15:40
being made illegal
15:42
illegitimately will not stand
15:45
yes well this is why you should be
15:47
celebrating because we will have the
15:49
ability
15:50
to move unhindered all open country
15:54
as god moves and does the victory thing
15:57
and you will see it with your eyes
15:59
everybody will see it with your eyes
16:00
this is why it's so important to come to
16:02
these events right now
16:03
to get filled up to get excited to begin
16:06
to make plans with god himself
16:08
about what your part will be in this so
16:10
this is a strategic event
16:12
you don't want to miss this this event
16:14
because this is god's time to bring in
16:16
that double
16:17
decade the divine decades uh
16:20
back to back in this in this country
16:22
here and it's going to be so powerful
16:24
your life won't be the same
16:26
we don't want it to go back exactly the
16:28
way it was we want it to be greater more
16:30
powerful in god
16:31
that we will be more accelerated forward
16:34
and the law will
16:35
flow in this country especially between
16:37
the body of crisis was really needed
16:39
first
16:40
and i declared that that love will be
16:41
released because the other
16:43
can't be hell can't be released right
16:45
now people
16:46
if you get me in the spirit room if you
16:48
were a or you would understand
16:50
it's leaving hell is leaving
16:53
and so that leaves those who want to be
16:55
in power
16:56
power less they won't have the effects
16:58
they won't have the enticement they
17:00
won't have that
17:01
uh the captivation of hell and evil
17:04
although it's already in them
17:05
it will not be released or lose
17:07
throughout this land because there's
17:08
been no portals
17:09
open because the one in true authority
17:12
is not allowing it
17:14
come on that's so good and of course the
17:17
wells are actually
17:18
portals because wells
17:21
one more thing there are these massive
17:24
angels some of the hosts have already
17:26
been sent to some of these wells
17:28
and they have these swords probably
17:30
they're 15 feet high swords
17:32
and they're like standing there like
17:33
this over them about to hit
17:35
them when we declare something at this
17:37
event they will hit
17:39
these wells these drywalls and they will
17:41
literally be open
17:42
and they'll shoot on springs so this is
17:45
a
17:45
specific event planned by god so this
17:48
can happen so don't miss being a part of
17:51
uh having those wells open can i share
17:55
something with you really quick uh
17:57
that's what i was seeing in the spirit
17:58
when i was beginning to pray and see you
18:00
coming over to this area
18:02
i saw you just taking a stake and
18:04
driving it
18:05
into the ground and it just broke open
18:09
this area and i saw the wells begin to
18:12
bubble up and the the
18:14
springs just begin to spring forth
18:17
throughout the earth
18:18
in this area and it just goes all the
18:20
way
18:21
from this side all the way down into the
18:24
east coast
18:25
and i just believe it's going to start
18:27
something here in this area
18:29
that has not been done before i'm so we
18:32
are so excited
18:36
well absolutely the convergence that
18:39
happens
18:40
when the right anointings and mantles
18:42
come together
18:43
and and times uh you do not receive a
18:46
breakthrough
18:47
because there's an element that's
18:49
missing but i believe
18:51
again us coming together especially with
18:53
miss cat especially with the now
18:55
anointing and the now word that she
18:56
carries
18:57
sun is gonna break open in the pacific
18:59
northwest
19:00
so listen people of god you need to be
19:03
there at this event i mean we're pretty
19:04
much sold out i don't know if
19:06
we can do overflow open up the doors and
19:09
have people just sitting outside we may
19:11
have to do that honestly
19:12
because we're already sold out uh but
19:14
you know there's going to be something
19:16
powerful that's going to be released
19:18
that's going to affect all the regions
19:21
of states nearby i guarantee it i
19:22
believe witches
19:24
are going to come to jesus yeah people
19:27
who are in
19:27
new age are going to be delivered okay
19:31
to warlocks weekends people
19:34
moving in the dark and black magic and
19:37
dark spirits they're they're going to
19:39
feel the tremors of the wealth opening
19:42
up so it's going to be powerful
19:44
um you know again as we're talking about
19:47
all this again what god is doing
19:49
in america right now on the earth what
19:51
god is doing from now
19:53
february all the way to april passover
19:56
and now specifically for this conference
19:57
this event
19:59
the washington glory invasion you know
20:02
i'm just reminded of
20:04
again uh uh john g
20:07
lake how he started up the healing
20:10
whales and the healing rooms in spokane
20:13
washington
20:14
and you know there's something
20:15
supernatural
20:17
that happens in the pacific northwest
20:19
and i believe something's going to break
20:21
with that mantle
20:22
now prophet shirelle is there something
20:24
you want to share with us concerning
20:26
john g
20:27
lake the healing rooms and that well of
20:29
revival
20:30
that's about to burst open i just
20:34
know that we are getting close we have
20:36
been seeing
20:37
more miracles than ever before
20:41
in our second service we had a man come
20:44
in and walk out of a wheelchair
20:46
i mean when taylor ran up to me and she
20:48
was like mom there's someone outside in
20:50
a wheelchair and i was going
20:52
oh my gosh not a wheelchair on my second
20:54
service
20:58
but it was incredible it's just
21:01
awesome to be pioneering here what has
21:04
been in god's heart for so long
21:07
and i just what i'm seeing is that this
21:10
explosion that's gonna happen
21:12
no man can keep his foot on it then the
21:16
holy spirit is getting ready to explode
21:18
in this area i believe we're going to
21:20
see miracles like never before
21:23
i believe we're going to see limbs
21:25
growing out
21:26
more blind eyes and deaf ears being
21:28
healed but not only that
21:30
families being healed god is calling
21:33
whole
21:34
families in this season he's calling the
21:36
prodigals
21:37
home and i'm so excited to see
21:41
and be a part of this movement and it's
21:44
like
21:44
god is strategically placing people
21:47
the right people together people that
21:50
probably
21:51
really never wanted to do anything like
21:53
this i don't know about you cat but i
21:55
was just minding my own business when
21:57
the fire of god
21:58
fell on me in my living room and he told
22:00
me to go live on facebook and i was like
22:03
you want me to do what
22:08
so i just believe that god
22:11
is raising up a remnant in this season
22:14
in this hour he's the people that he's
22:16
bringing to the hub here
22:18
are just so hungry and they're tired of
22:22
church
22:22
they're tired of religion they're tired
22:25
of being
22:26
put in a box i took the box slacks
22:29
last week and i ripped it in half and i
22:31
threw it
22:32
and i stomped on it during the circuit
22:36
because i just believe you know when
22:38
we're led by the holy spirit
22:41
it's powerful yes it is we give him the
22:44
platform
22:45
and he does it all it takes the pressure
22:47
off of us
22:48
and we just give him the reigns and we
22:50
say have your way holy spirit
22:53
and i believe that's people like john g
22:55
lakes that's what he did
22:56
he probably surrendered his life to the
22:59
holy spirit and that's why god
23:00
used him so mightily and that's what
23:03
we're seeing right now
23:04
and another thing is i feel like
23:08
you know um god's using the most
23:11
unlikely people
23:12
yeah and people that are not really that
23:16
well liked people don't like cats pink
23:19
hair
23:20
people don't like my pink lipstick
23:26
but i'm just being obedient to god and
23:29
just saying
23:30
use me lord i surrender my life to you
23:32
and
23:34
he's gonna he's gonna do something in
23:36
this area that we have not seen
23:38
we are getting ready to see something
23:41
that we have never
23:43
seen i mean what are the odds of the
23:46
kansas city chiefs
23:48
going to the super bowl for a second
23:50
time
23:51
yeah that's incredible well well
23:55
once again god god is the god of the
23:57
miraculous and he's the god of the
23:59
double and the triple
24:00
so i believe in the season just like
24:02
prophet shirelle said
24:03
that the unlikely the no names the
24:06
faceless
24:06
those that objected looked down upon i
24:09
mean president donald j
24:10
trump took took it by storm and he came
24:14
totally from
24:14
left uh from the left side from you know
24:17
left wing
24:18
but again it's those types of people
24:20
where there will be a supernatural grace
24:22
to be an apostolic chief like the kansas
24:25
city chiefs
24:26
god's raising of apostolic chiefs
24:28
prophetic warriors in the season
24:30
who carry the now word of god and who
24:32
walk in signs
24:34
and wonders yeah uh of course we're
24:37
talking about this event
24:38
uh you know we're all going to be
24:40
together literally in a few days
24:42
i know my cities
24:52
uh talk to us what are you expecting for
24:55
this
24:56
event it's really not even an event but
24:58
it's
24:59
it's a family celebration it is because
25:03
it's actually an encounter um yes god
25:06
doesn't always call things events
25:07
anymore he calls them encounters
25:09
and those who are there or who choose to
25:11
encounter what he's got
25:13
those are the ones who will go away with
25:15
it to use it to release it for him
25:18
but something else about john g lake um
25:22
i remember one time when i was i was
25:24
under attack that was probably maybe 12
25:26
14 years ago when all that happened and
25:29
i was heading to
25:30
memphis to um release elvis's mantle to
25:34
be completed because it wasn't completed
25:37
and then he bought me every way i could
25:39
that's how important mantles are they're
25:40
so important
25:42
and i i told my husband knows throw me
25:44
in the back of the
25:45
truck there was a double cab and
25:47
margaret drove all the way there and we
25:49
were listening to
25:50
um billy brims tapes about had all those
25:54
who had passed on before
25:56
she had recorded things and i think john
25:58
g
25:59
lake's son-in-law was speaking and he
26:01
was talking about
26:03
um speaking in tongues and i'm telling
26:06
you it started to get really hot
26:10
it was so hot and all of a sudden the
26:13
holy spirit said
26:14
i want you to claim it and so he was
26:16
speaking under the anointing of the
26:19
lightning power of god that was one of
26:20
the things john d like operated in
26:22
it just blasts the enemy out it's still
26:24
a part of the fire of god
26:26
and god said claim your healing and i
26:28
yelled i couldn't speak up until that
26:30
point it said i
26:30
i claim it and all of a sudden a fire
26:34
came through the speaker
26:35
hit me at the end of my feet when i went
26:37
my body and drove the sickness out
26:40
and i was instantly and i was on fire it
26:43
started getting so
26:44
hot in the cab and i know the holy
26:46
spirit was just laughing he was so
26:47
celebrating
26:48
see because i out of an act of obedience
26:51
i was just dared to do it
26:53
and when we got to the event when we got
26:55
to the this place
26:57
in memphis where i was speaking about
26:59
albus and why god called him and
27:00
anointed him
27:01
and was talking about that mantle then
27:03
people ran forward to get prayer
27:05
the holy spirit said impart the fire of
27:08
the lightning power of god into them i'm
27:10
like
27:10
when did i get that and he said you said
27:12
you received it and i said
27:14
i thought i received him and he said oh
27:16
you have the mantle
27:18
of the lightning power of god that john
27:19
g lake operated in and since
27:22
that day i have used that lightning
27:24
power god it destroys the works of
27:26
darkness no matter what is
27:28
about and i did it so much so many times
27:31
john g lake actually showed up
27:34
at my event
27:37
there you could see by several people
27:40
who were present
27:41
and he was just watching me release the
27:43
lightening power of god i can tell you
27:44
what's going to be the lighting power of
27:45
god is going to be at that event people
27:47
and it destroys the warts of darkness in
27:50
your life
27:51
in cities and regions and i mean no
27:54
guess what it's probably going to show
27:55
up there
27:56
probably john g lake that's where he's
27:58
from
27:59
and so expect the lightning power of god
28:01
expect the miraculous to happen and i do
28:04
expect things to happen that never
28:06
happened before so it's going to be a
28:08
power
28:09
a power encounter of god of holy spirit
28:13
of jesus
28:14
of this whole area being least
28:17
at least released into its destiny
28:20
to bring the life and the power of god
28:22
into this country and then throughout
28:24
the world so
28:25
this is a major encounter time
28:28
on god's timeline so please don't
28:31
miss being there because we are all a
28:33
part of this when we come into agreement
28:36
great power is released
28:39
wow that is so powerful that's why uh
28:41
you know as
28:42
myself and prophet shiro we prayed about
28:45
a title for this encounter
28:48
you know uh the washington glory
28:50
invasion because
28:51
the lightning angels of course the
28:54
thunders and lightnings from his throne
28:56
are actually angelic hosts that are
28:58
being released from his throne
29:00

29:02
invading and they're they're already

29:27
what the world says there's a new wave
29:30

33:35
as cat was just talking the lord
33:38
reminded me
33:39
of an encounter i had last month
33:42
i was down in my living room worshiping
33:44
on my knees and i had my eyes
33:46
closed and i could see the biggest
33:49
angel i've ever seen in the spirit
33:53
his wings were stretched from each side
33:56
of my living room and right at that
33:58
moment
33:59
it hit my spirit and i just knew that it
34:02
was the angel
34:03
of awakening and revival and
34:06
he said one thing to me he said
34:10
it is time
34:13
and as cat was speaking i just
34:16
kept hearing that over and over it is
34:19
time
34:20
it is the time and we are standing on
34:24
this
34:24
we are believing it and we are going to
34:28
see it come to fruition in this season

03:51
splendor the splendor the wonder of you
03:57
inside of us I thank you for the father
04:00
and everyone said amen amen
04:04
[Music]
04:05
wow this is an awesome atmosphere thank
04:11
you for coming everyone the only thing I
04:17
like more about going to heaven is
04:19
sharing it I can't teach you how to do
04:23
that I have a commission to do that I
04:25
can tell you that he is catching people
04:27
up all over this world and showing him
04:30
his home for Christ said in my father's
04:35
house are many mansions and I can assure
04:39
you that his house is not a building
04:43
it's not a platform somewhere in the sky
04:46
it is a world bigger than our galaxy
04:52
even bigger than that there's no way you
04:56
can measure it or even understand how he
04:59
designed it it's always been his home
05:02
until the day he makes the new earth and
05:05
then we all have a home together I don't
05:09
know if you realize this he's actually
05:10
willing to leave his own home
05:12
to live with us Christ had to leave it
05:15
when he became down-to-earth and he
05:18
became flesh had flesh when he died on
05:20
the cross the Holy Spirit moved his base
05:22
of operations here because Christ sent
05:25
him here and then one day the father
05:28
himself will leave heaven and forever
05:30
live on the new earth with all of us and
05:33
that amazing that they had to be willing
05:37
to do all of that for us that's because
05:40
He loves you that's because you actually
05:42
came from him everyone who ever existed
05:45
came from him you didn't live somewhere
05:49
in heaven you lived in him he was your
05:52
very world the enemy is always trying to
05:56
copycat but God has he wants to be God
05:59
that's never going to happen it didn't
06:03
happen back in the ancient times when he
06:05
was thrown out of heaven when he was so
06:08
convinced he convinced himself he had
06:11
won he gotten a third of the angels on
06:14
his side which still is almost it makes
06:17
you undo that doesn't it they lived with
06:22
a God who made them and yet they chose a
06:24
creation over the Creator and let me
06:32
tell you just because God didn't say
06:33
anything Jim didn't mean that he didn't
06:35
know about it but the more he deceived
06:40
and the more God remained silent he
06:43
thought that he had won he thought it
06:45
was smarter than God and then he found
06:47
out in a second
06:50
he wasn't anything
06:53
it wasn't anything he was kicked out of
06:56
heaven all the angels were kicked out
06:58
with him they can never be restored and
07:01
I know you may hear people preach that
07:04
one day God will forgive everybody the
07:06
everyone will go to heaven he'll forgive
07:09
Lucifer he'll forgive the fallen angels
07:11
that will not ever happen their future
07:14
is already sealed in the lake of fire
07:17
they will not be anywhere near us on the
07:20
new earth it says the former things when
07:24
we remember no more
07:25
in heaven right now though you give
07:28
testimony of your life and the victory
07:31
that God gave you on this earth when you
07:33
get to heaven but one day none of the
07:35
things that that were a part of your
07:38
life without him
07:39
where you will not even be able to
07:41
remember them but I will tell you right
07:44
now even on this earth will become so
07:46
supernatural like him let's say this
07:50
together God said let us make man in our
07:57
image and after our likeness and let
08:01
them have dominion over the earth that's
08:07
his plan for you so people say that we
08:11
can't be like him they're wrong he would
08:14
have never said that in case you didn't
08:17
know after the likeness is the way they
08:20
operate so he didn't just make you in
08:23
His image he gave you things inside of
08:25
you so that you could operate like him
08:28
so who is he he's a creator right Jesus
08:32
Christ as a commander is that right
08:35
Holy Spirit goes everyone knows
08:37
everything all at the same time Holy
08:39
Spirit is an unlimited layered being
08:43
don't you like Revelation he has
08:48
unlimited layers of himself and every
08:51
layer of him is a whole of him so ever
08:55
he sends a layer of himself he knows
08:58
everything everywhere all at the same
09:01
time so for your information when you
09:05
invite Holy Spirit to and well you you
09:08
don't get a little piece of him he sends
09:11
a layer of himself which is a whole of
09:14
him who indwells you and that is what
09:17
makes you the Temple of the Holy Spirit
09:21
that is one of the most important things
09:24
you can do up to get born again it's not
09:26
even preached in some places right now
09:27
you know because enemy is terrified of
09:30
that happening to you because then
09:32
instead of walking beside you it says
09:35
the word when you get born again he
09:36
comes alongside you is that right
09:39
and he'll be there all the time until
09:42
you caught up to heaven one day unless
09:44
you do something about it
09:46
unless you choose to ask him to end well
09:50
you you have to invite him say we must
09:53
invite say we had to invite Christ to
09:59
indwell us we had in my Holy Spirit to
10:03
indwell us it's heaven protocol and the
10:09
reason for that is you had to make a
10:11
choice you chose with your will to
10:14
receive Christ and let me tell you we
10:17
actually have a new CD called born again
10:20
that the father had me just make it
10:22
tells you what happened in the spirit
10:24
realm what happened in eternity in the
10:27
scrolls of time and the Lamb's Book of
10:29
Life in Hell and inside your very being
10:34
that made you the new creation what
10:36
happened at that time at that moment in
10:38
time and it's on this CD God born again
10:41
it's one of the best witnessing tools
10:44
I've ever had or ever made it explains
10:46
why Christ why do you have to receive
10:49
him what happens when you receive him
10:51
what levels you can go after after that
10:54
happens what happens in Holy Spirit
10:57
indwells you what happens all around you
10:59
what happens with the hosts of heaven
11:01
what happens with your guardian angel
11:03
this if you're not aware of the spirit
11:05
realm the unseen realm I'm talking about
11:07
the unseen realm it says everything that
11:11
was made that you see was made by that
11:13
which was unseen that means the unseen
11:17
realm is the original realm not this
11:21
physical realm this physical realm is
11:24
temporal it's temporary that's what that
11:27
means but eternity is in this in the
11:31
spirit realm there's more activity in
11:33
the spirit realm than there is in the
11:35
seen realm there's it never stops
11:40
activity never stops in the unseen realm
11:42
not around you not around where you live
11:45
not in the atmosphere not into the third
11:48
heavens there's continual activity both
11:51
from heaven
11:52
and from hell and what you do in your
11:55
life
11:56
will draw one of the other to you that's
12:00
why you need to sermon that's why you
12:02
need a holy spirit that's why you need
12:04
to pursue an intimate relationship with
12:06
Jesus Christ there's a lot of stuff
12:09
going on in this world today even in the
12:11
body of Christ that shouldn't be
12:13
happening there's a lot of good and
12:16
there's a lot of God
12:17
I'm not going to discount that because
12:19
God is pouring himself more and more
12:21
into this world
12:23
Christ is making himself known to us
12:26
every day of our life you can increase
12:27
in that relationship with him because he
12:30
wants that kind of relationship with you
12:33
he's not sitting on the sidelines
12:35
watching your life go by no he armed us
12:40
when you were born again you got weapons
12:43
you got the anointing you got Authority
12:46
given to you because you are now a son
12:50
of the Living God your son or daughter
12:51
of the Living God and what you do with
12:55
your life after you receive him is
12:57
totally up to you but right now living
13:01
on this earth are many that he called to
13:04
demonstrate for him in the greater works
13:08
that Christ talked about they're beyond
13:11
your imagination to even consider or
13:15
think you might actually get to do some
13:17
of that like going to a funeral and
13:20
raising someone the dead that was
13:22
cremated
13:24
[Music]
13:26
I hope I got someone's attention
13:30
everybody say that's a greater work
13:36
people think well you know Lazarus was
13:38
dead for four days correct that's in the
13:42
scriptures he was dead he was thinking
13:44
his body was stinking Mary and Martha
13:48
were trying to show Christ it is too
13:49
late and let me tell you Christ did not
13:51
cry because the Lazarus died he said it
13:57
was going to be okay didn't he yeah
14:00
because he knew who he was
14:02
no he cried because they didn't believe
14:03
it
14:05
they were doubting him he had said yeah
14:09
he'll be resurrected yes we know on the
14:12
day that the dead in Christ is raised
14:13
he'll be raising who's trying to say no
14:15
right now you know he was there right he
14:20
knew what was going to happen let me
14:21
tell you people in Abraham's bosom were
14:23
shocked do we ever think of that how
14:30
many people don't know what Abraham's
14:31
bosom was let me see your hand it's okay
14:33
if you don't know a lot of places don't
14:35
teach that anymore before Christ died on
14:38
the cross and descendant in hell and
14:41
wiped up hell went up to heaven and
14:43
poured out his blood on the mercy seat
14:45
when people when righteous people died
14:47
that God called righteous they descended
14:49
into Abraham's bosom which was a
14:51
spiritual abode God made for his friends
14:55
they didn't sit on rocks
14:57
it was a spirit round place it had
15:00
golden buildings and had a sky and had a
15:03
magnificent river and had Kings tables
15:06
filled with feast for them to partake of
15:08
and below that was hell and there was a
15:13
great gulf between them this is what the
15:15
word says and those in Hell inside the
15:18
gates of hell you come up to the
15:19
courtyard of hell you can see up into
15:22
Abraham's bosom but she couldn't go
15:24
there they could see them if they came
15:27
close to there was like I'm trying to
15:30
think of where my mind's not in the
15:31
natural realm at all right now I like a
15:35
balcony raining pink your Holy Spirit in
15:37
this beautiful place he'd made for
15:40
for him Isaac Jacob Joseph who raised
15:43
Jesus right John the Baptist was there
15:46
is that true yes because they were
15:49
righteous they were accounted righteous
15:50
either because they believed in God
15:51
himself
15:52
and they extended the faith for that
15:55
when they died they went there they
15:57
didn't descend into hell that was for
15:59
the wicked dad but they could see each
16:02
other at one point and so people in
16:07
Abraham's bosom already knew the Messiah
16:09
was on the earth as soon as Joseph went
16:13
there they knew because he wouldn't stop
16:16
talking about it if you knew that and
16:20
you went there would you talk about it
16:24
yeah he non-stop talked about it and
16:27
then when John the Baptist went who was
16:31
his cousin he confirmed everything
16:34
Joseph said but he even knew more
16:36
because he was there after Joseph he was
16:39
still there living on yours after Joseph
16:41
went and descendant Abraham's bosom so
16:43
than John the Baptist was talking about
16:45
him he actually saw him right he
16:49
baptized him he wouldn't stop talking I
16:51
have baptized the Messiah he is here on
16:54
the earth he's here so they already knew
16:58
any bands living the Messiah was on the
17:00
earth so let me tell when he showed up
17:01
there they knew who he was
17:03
and he proved who he was because he
17:07
himself left for the first time left
17:10
Abraham's bosom and crossed over into
17:13
Hell on his own because he had an
17:15
assignment it was to take back our
17:19
authority and our Dominion that God had
17:24
given you know had given Adam and Eve
17:26
and then they they sold out but you know
17:28
what they were redeemed yester in heaven
17:30
say yay
17:32
Adam and Eve are in heaven how about
17:35
that they made it so sometimes you don't
17:42
really think about the whole scope of
17:45
this picture and so as someone else came
17:49
to Abraham's bosom they would tell them
17:51
what was going on on the earth because
17:53
they were new the new arrivals and it's
17:55
just like in heaven when somebody newly
17:57
arrives they'll chase you down they'll
18:01
start getting you in a minute you come
18:02
in the gate and you're still trying to
18:04
jump in the river water like okay da da
18:06
da da da
18:06
you would have weighed about this what
18:07
was it I heard this was going on what
18:09
about this is this true now I saw
18:10
something from the portal but they
18:12
didn't know all about so why don't you
18:13
why don't we go share somewhere they
18:15
want to haul you off somewhere and share
18:16
with you they want to hear what
18:18
when hear what you have to say and later
18:19
you're going to have meetings everyone
18:23
your family members had to stand on a
18:24
platform and share to the body of Christ
18:27
living in heaven about their life how
18:30
God redeemed and what was going on
18:32
around them and then what was newly
18:33
invented on the earth they won every
18:35
time somebody new comes they want to
18:36
know I promise you was the exact same
18:39
and Abraham is bosom okay you don't get
18:43
a chance to do it when you go to hell
18:44
okay you have no life in Hell been there
18:49
and seen it you don't want to go there
18:52
there's people right now saying there is
18:54
no hell they may find out one day their
19:00
death there definitely is it talks about
19:02
it in the word it exists it's there but
19:06
in Abraham's bosom life was amazing it
19:09
was beautiful they had feasts to eat you
19:13
don't get anything in hell there will be
19:15
no food in hell I love that one song
19:19
that says they don't see they don't
19:21
serve breakfast in Hell huh
19:26
Jevon heard it I think isn't it uh it's
19:30
called like my father's house in that
19:32
the name of the song might and but yeah
19:35
big big houses big big house and they
19:38
are telling people you won't get
19:39
breakfast in hell you don't but
19:46
Abraham's bosom has more than nothing
19:48
plenty they needed to enjoy their life
19:50
they were always excited when somebody
19:52
new came there and most of the time they
19:55
didn't have to ask him they came there
19:56
talking about it especially once the Son
19:59
of God and the Messiah was on the Earth
20:01
Day that was the number one subject they
20:02
want to know about I know I was taken
20:05
there I saw Abraham's bosom it wasn't
20:08
some little tiny hobble on a rock people
20:10
picture them sitting in the middle of
20:11
Earth you know trying to escape the lava
20:14
the spirit realm supersedes his physical
20:17
realm
20:18
that's why spiritual beings can pass
20:21
through the walls they can walk through
20:22
you your angel stands in you most of the
20:24
time yeah they sit on you too sometimes
20:29
especially if you ever get out on the
20:33
floor if you're knocked out by the
20:35
Spirit of God or the boy whatever it is
20:37
it get you on that floor and you can't
20:39
move your angel is sitting on you
20:43
you can't even crawl I've been there I'd
20:46
see him sit on me and they wouldn't get
20:49
up and all I could do was laugh I mean I
20:52
couldn't crawl I tell my family don't
20:54
bother me until I can crawl up to the
20:55
you know altar leave me there you'll
21:01
find out one day everything they did ok
21:02
for you into you but there was big news
21:08
in Abraham's bosom about the Messiah
21:12
once Lazarus came he was dead for four
21:18
days where do you think he was he was
21:21
the newest thing in Abraham's bosom and
21:23
that man who was one of Christ's best
21:26
friends knew beyond a shadow of a doubt
21:29
who he was he would not stop talking
21:31
about the Messiah and here he is like
21:33
into a starting his fourth day there
21:35
just going full steam ahead Wham they
21:42
lost her nothing jerk they heard a voice
21:49
Lazarus heard him he heard him calling
21:52
him from there did you think he's going
21:54
to say no one does it yeah
21:56
later when I'm done oh he did not care
21:59
okay
22:01
he called him to come forth he came out
22:04
of Abraham his spiritual body came at
22:05
Abraham's bosom back into the tomb
22:08
picked up his body and he came out of
22:11
that tomb still in the wrappings and he
22:14
wasn't stinking because he was fresh
22:19
alive by the glory of God raised up from
22:23
the dead to be a miraculous
22:26
demonstration of the power of Jesus
22:29
Christ which has been given to you and I
22:34
you should see it that way
22:36
we are joint heirs with him what he did
22:40
on this earth we have the ability if we
22:43
walk in and go after it to do that he
22:46
said that we have the ability to raise
22:48
the dead is right heal the sick raise
22:50
the dead cast out demons is that right
22:55
Trump is supposed to your rights with
22:57
the powerless if you believe you got to
23:02
remember that there are requirements to
23:05
all those who believe right these shot
23:08
designs shall follow them and so here
23:14
was Christ demonstrating it doesn't
23:16
matter how long it not matter if your
23:17
dad you know you know no matter if you
23:19
died right then raise him up know that
23:21
he was dead for four days so we're going
23:23
to do greater works that means it has to
23:25
be something greater than being dead for
23:27
four days he didn't mean being dead for
23:30
seven days he meant when you were ashes
23:35
I I was taken forward in time and I
23:38
literally was young this is one of the
23:40
greater works and Christ took me there
23:43
and I saw somebody raising someone from
23:46
the dead at a funeral that had been
23:49
cremated and everyone in the funeral
23:53
home Ryan down front Peters face on the
23:56
floor I began to cry out to Jesus cry
24:00
and I am absolutely what he shows me is
24:07
literal he doesn't show me symbolic
24:10
things ever he treats me like I'm a he
24:13
says I'm going to show you so you know
24:14
what I'm talking about
24:15
that is something that will happen I'm
24:18
sure we'll be go viral around the earth
24:22
so the knowledge of a glory
24:25
sometimes we'll go through the internet
24:29
did you think about that that's
24:34
something was watching over a few times
24:36
isn't that people watch laughing dogs 10
24:43
million times and I want to point out no
24:49
matter what tragedies and stuff are
24:50
going on out there
24:52
the laughing dogs top all the doom and
24:56
gloom and the wicked evil stopped
24:58
because people want something that
25:00
they're going to enjoy so why don't you
25:03
give them something to enjoy your
25:07
testimony should be filled with glory
25:09
power right victory that's the word of
25:13
your testimony you overcome with that
25:15
that's not the story of your doom and
25:16
gloom and and ten hours of your
25:18
sufferings that's a story a testimony is
25:24
how you were tested and you got big tree
25:28
and Christ gets all the glory for it he
25:33
actually told me to help you if you're
25:34
writing a book about your life make sure
25:35
he gets more than ten pages because it
25:40
won't be worth reading if you make
25:42
people suffer along with you through
25:45
your entire lives and yet
25:48
can you give an ounce of victory that
25:49
doesn't show them that they can overcome
25:52
even during them in the midst of what
25:55
they're going through
25:56
you should have victory every day of
25:58
your life because he delivers us out of
26:01
it all so started giving them the
26:05
victory the minute you step into
26:06
something start declaring you have
26:08
victory you're giving them the glory
26:10
it's because of him not you that you are
26:13
an overcomer because your words have
26:15
power if you don't remember anything
26:19
else remember to watch your words what
26:23
do you want in your life
26:24
what do you want your family's life what
26:28
do you want right now in your life
26:30
because what you say is what you're
26:32
going to get the word says you'll eat
26:35
the fruit of your lips that right
26:38
whatsoever you will have whatsoever you
26:41
say it loud you shall have whatsoever
26:43
you I think that means your words are
26:47
important
26:48
he made me count my words woman 9 every
26:53
time I open my mouth I had to think
26:55
about what I was going to say he trained
26:56
me to speak life and not negative not
27:00
negative unless he shows me something
27:04
that he has said I am to be aware of and
27:07
to not be a part of I don't run around
27:10
spending my life critiquing everybody
27:12
else's life and pointing out all their
27:14
weaknesses because you're not helping
27:17
them when you do that you're not you
27:21
need to talk about people's strengths
27:22
their gifts right God's plans for them
27:26
share the truth of them while you're
27:28
doing it because they're going to open
27:29
they're going to be open to you to speak
27:31
to them if you're encouraging them not
27:34
blasting them and I also know that you
27:37
help the enemy when you blast them it's
27:40
like you're part of the enemy's camp
27:42
this is my assignment to tell them how
27:45
wicked and evil they are how far they
27:47
have fallen from God that they're
27:48
walking in hopelessness they'll never
27:50
have anything no that is the enemy's
27:52
words
27:53
that's how we talked if you hear that
27:56
don't say it if you hear those words
27:58
turn wrong go I know who you are and
28:00
I'll have nothing to do with you you'll
28:03
freak him out
28:05
because most people just say what he
28:07
says right so if we're going to be like
28:12
Christ in the Earth's we have to be
28:13
careful what we say how we live the
28:16
choices that we make in our life your
28:20
soul is said every minute of the day by
28:23
what you say what people say to you what
28:25
you watch what you hear and places you
28:27
go your soul is going to be whatever
28:30
this is the way God said whatever you
28:32
enter into is going to enter into you
28:35
that's a quote a quote from heaven what
28:39
you enter into will enter into you that
28:43
means in your soul and that's important
28:47
because you are a living soul we've all
28:51
said you know we haven't we you know we
28:53
we we're a body we are a spirit we have
28:56
a soul no you are soul you are a soul
28:59
wrapped in your spirit man and you have
29:02
flesh on your body so you can have
29:03
dominion in the earth but you are a soul
29:06
and you choose whether it prospers or
29:10
not if you want to prosper and be in
29:13
health
29:14
then you guard what goes in your soul
29:17
you can change the way you think the way
29:19
you respond even what happens to you
29:22
tomorrow
29:23
by what you decide tonight to do with
29:26
your soul you can't take your soul and
29:28
set it on a shelf and pretend like it's
29:30
something bad because when I grew up in
29:33
denominational churches they always said
29:35
the soulless realm is bad your soul is
29:37
bad well then how come it got saved I
29:43
was eight now we have all these big
29:45
questions for people that didn't want to
29:48
answer if I soul just got saved right he
29:53
came to save souls right if I gave it to
29:57
Jesus and he moved in then why is my
29:59
soul bad I don't think anything bad I'm
30:04
not looking to bad stuff I mean just owe
30:06
me eight years old
30:07
they made decisions when I was young I
30:09
was going to be on the side of my
30:10
parents I was going to be on God's side
30:13
now it's going to help him he needed
30:16
help so I really consider what I do in
30:20
my life even when I was young I did so I
30:23
escaped even though it's raising a
30:26
teenager and the whole drug thing when
30:27
it first came out by the way marijuana
30:29
is bad no matter what they tell you
30:40
that's from heaven he did not make it so
30:45
you could smoke it I don't care if it is
30:48
a natural plant I will preach it I grew
30:54
up in that time when it first came well
30:56
in my era when it first came people lost
31:01
jobs they lost friendships they got
31:05
sucked into LSD and all the other drugs
31:07
I didn't do any of it I decided at 15 I
31:11
was having nothing to do with it and I
31:13
wasn't participating so I still have all
31:15
my brain I'm in great hell because I
31:21
never participated in the drug thing I
31:23
didn't need anybody else's approval I
31:27
wasn't part of a clique I didn't know
31:29
that peer pressure bother me actually I
31:31
tried to talk all my friends in high
31:32
school
31:33
well my acquaintances I didn't have a
31:35
lot of friends I had a head or tribe at
31:37
home I would tell the hologram I said
31:39
you're nuts for taking the stuff you get
31:41
a burn your brain cells up you know what
31:44
are you going to become you can't even
31:46
think right and people got I think I
31:49
think 60 out of 600 seniors are od'd in
31:52
my senior class all from drugs and all
31:57
of them started on marijuana every
32:01
single one of them they actually give it
32:03
to you free they give it to you free get
32:07
you hooked up then they bring something
32:09
stronger to you that's how it works I
32:11
was in the elevator in the hotel and I
32:14
heard a young man he said coming on
32:17
business to meet with some business
32:18
people here and he was saying
32:21
the phone not who I was we blasted him
32:24
with the anointing the whole time is and
32:26
when he love is that oh yeah I had a
32:28
great time my business meeting were very
32:29
productive he said these people they
32:32
were real real with me we drank and we
32:33
smoked some I knew what he meant okay he
32:38
didn't need it from the distal purposes
32:41
but these were leaders in a business
32:44
community that gave it to this young man
32:48
that's not even ethical it's not right
32:52
he hadn't even had it before but that's
32:56
the enemy's plan and he was a man this
33:00
was an amazing experience in my mind I'm
33:02
thinking devil you are not getting that
33:04
person man I stand right now releasing
33:06
the anointing him he walked out the door
33:08
we sent the host event I pulled all of
33:09
the strongholds of the demonic the
33:11
addictive demonic to toll that
33:12
stronghold off of him and pull it off of
33:15
him and we were sending on the glory
33:16
after him the anointing after him to
33:18
break the yoke of Darkness off of him
33:20
and went god I am not tolerating this
33:22
I'm not tolerating it and people were
33:28
Jesus didn't he said he talks about any
33:30
kind of Pharmacia
33:32
that was drugs even back in his day they
33:35
had them he talked about necromancer's
33:38
have nothing to do with a necromancer
33:40
that is witchcraft
33:44
there's no good witches and there's
33:48
people that really think there are there
33:50
are no good witches warlocks wizards
33:57
magicians
34:00
there was not one magician in the Bible
34:02
that was good and we sitting here we've
34:06
been so consumed with society and the
34:09
world itself that we've accepted a lot
34:12
of stuff but let me tell you he never
34:13
accepted it so we need to take a good
34:18
long look at herself and say where am I
34:20
where am i and what God has called me to
34:23
be what he what he showed me I am what
34:26
Christ gave me how did he walk where did
34:28
he do we had bracelets for ever what
34:31
would Jesus do
34:32
not a lot of what goes on now
34:36
because if we're witnesses our lives
34:40
supposed to be a witness right you
34:42
didn't know you're going to come to
34:43
church tonight
34:45
I'm saving the good step for next all
34:49
those in Abraham's bosom they lived a
34:52
righteous life according to you
34:54
receiving God okay they believed who he
34:58
was they believed when he spoke they
34:59
believed they followed him and what he
35:01
said and so they were kind of righteous
35:03
so they were they descended in Abraham's
35:05
bosom
35:05
but the minute Lazar showed up they knew
35:08
something was going to happen on the
35:11
earth not just to them then you somebody
35:14
change for them because their Messiah
35:16
had come they knew it they knew
35:19
something would be manifested in the
35:21
earth and it certainly was maybe not
35:23
what they expected but let me tell you
35:26
when Christ Himself showed up a little
35:30
while later with the sea from the cross
35:33
because when Christ gave up his spirit
35:36
he'd still be hanging there by the way
35:39
he did no one killed him he laid down
35:41
his life he actually had to make his
35:43
spirit man leave his body he himself
35:46
loosed it from his body yeah that's
35:50
going to be in a movie one day and then
35:53
you will see in the movie Christ
35:54
descending into Abraham's bosom him
35:57
sharing the good news with him all
35:58
receiving him as Christ as their Savior
36:00
and let me tell you when his spear man
36:05
entered into that ground there was such
36:06
an upheaval that they themselves walked
36:09
on the earth Deborah and Abraham's bosom
36:12
go read the scripture they were seen
36:17
walking on the earth is that crazy you
36:20
think they'd get a hint right okay uh
36:23
that one's from 100 years ago 300 years
36:26
ago he's walking on here something's
36:28
going on down there
36:30
[Music]
36:32
and Christ wasn't done because then he
36:34
was going to go wreck hell my favorite
36:39
one of my favorite times is when they
36:41
took me when they took me down into hell
36:44
and I was there on the third day when
36:46
Christ wasted them it will be in a
36:53
movie
36:55
[Laughter]
36:57
[Applause]
37:01
not even a world-class movie a heaven
37:04
class maybe they will be produced on
37:07
this earth by the best of the best with
37:10
the best special effects that will get
37:13
people undone everywhere
37:15
and they'll know what happened there's
37:18
actually a demand in Hollywood they want
37:20
to know what happened between the cross
37:21
and when you when you went back to
37:24
heaven they want to know they want to
37:29
know what happened now when he went back
37:33
when when his disciples saw him
37:34
ascending into heaven he'd already been
37:35
there did you know that because when he
37:41
came out of the grave whither do you
37:42
tell Mary I must go to my my father and
37:47
your father right yeah because he had to
37:50
pour his blood on the mercy seat in
37:51
heaven so when he said it was finished
37:55
on the cross that meant that every
37:57
sacrifice for all sin for all time was
38:01
once and for all never again when
38:03
something has to be sacrificed for sin
38:04
you would never again go to the temple
38:06
once a year to get forgiven did you know
38:09
that they went once a year to get
38:12
forgiven okay then they tried to do the
38:14
best all year they go back again and
38:16
then Hilary sigh questions they had this
38:18
whole thing that God had shown them to
38:20
do and then there's all kinds of things
38:22
you need to go back and read it anyway
38:24
that's the way you got forgiven that's
38:26
what that's what freaked out all the
38:28
high priests when John the Baptist
38:29
started saying you know repent of your
38:32
sins the kingdom of heaven is at hand
38:33
well they never heard that before that's
38:37
why they didn't like him
38:39
so when new revelation comes to the
38:41
earth there is always upheaval and
38:45
you're hearing the new what is the new
38:48
that means new things will happen new
38:50
ways will happen new words will happen
38:52
you're living in a time like that right
38:54
now
38:55
yeah because we'll be ruling and
38:57
reigning with Christ this is a whole new
39:00
time that was a new time a phonus of
39:03
time has come that with the fullness of
39:04
time so crisis we can having on the
39:09
earth before he ever went into hell then
39:10
you really wiped up hell because they
39:13
thought they thought they had won the
39:18
second time Satan had a brain free
39:25
honestly he did the father said he lost
39:29
something in his mind when he fell yeah
39:34
part of his memory banks because he
39:37
still thinks even now he's going to win
39:40
he's already been defeated what he's
39:42
totally defeated but I mean God kicked
39:45
him out of heaven he didn't win them
39:46
when he's going to take over and go
39:48
inside the Father and rule from his side
39:50
the Father and be over all the people
39:52
the people weren't on the earth yet that
39:54
was us inside God he knew we were in
39:58
there isn't that interesting he knew
40:03
about us for a very long time he didn't
40:06
know who we were he knew we were
40:08
important he knew we weren't angels
40:11
because God didn't just speak and make
40:13
us we lived in him forever until he made
40:16
this earth time space planet to send us
40:19
here and when he made Adam his body when
40:22
the word made out in his body in the
40:24
father leaned over and breathe Adam his
40:25
spiritual being his spirit of life into
40:28
his nostrils and he became a living soul
40:30
the enemy was right there watching
40:33
because he was thrown on the oars
40:35
remember yeah he was watching he knew
40:37
where that came from
40:38
he knew that was somebody that came from
40:41
inside God and then he was not well one
40:43
way wasn't happy because now God was
40:44
sending them which would mean a lot of
40:47
trouble for him if they ever found out
40:49
who they were
40:52
so God had a plan when he sent his
40:54
people if is to be like him on the earth
40:58
to take authority over all the power of
41:00
the enemy crush him push him back take
41:05
our rightful place at Christ one for us
41:07
he died for your sins but he went into
41:10
hell to get back your authority the atom
41:13
had given away because he was righteous
41:15
and they had no right to hold him so
41:18
Abraham his bosom was ready to see a
41:20
show and hell was ready to put on a show
41:24
there's only one person who put a show
41:26
on and made a show of it openly and that
41:30
was the Son of the Living God if you
41:38
don't think they like a show up there
41:40
you don't know him because God put on a
41:43
show was another show when he sent
41:47
lightning bolts from himself and took
41:49
Satan out right and then one third of
41:52
angels were all kicked out the same way
41:54
they were celebrating in heaven because
41:57
they had had it up to here with Lucifer
42:00
I don't know anyone in heaven that cried
42:03
when he was kicked out the Gabriel did
42:06
not cry and Michael certainly did not
42:09
cry because from that moment on he knew
42:11
who the enemy was because before that
42:14
happened there was no enemy heaven was a
42:18
delightful place it was a wonderful
42:20
place it was perfect in every way even
42:23
Lucifer was perfect in all his ways
42:25
until iniquity was found in him and that
42:28
was that he was greater than God he was
42:30
going to take over that didn't happen
42:34
either so he was kicked down to earth
42:37
and decided well I'm just going to take
42:38
over here on this nice place I'll just
42:41
take over here let me tell you what
42:43
happened when he first made those plans
42:45
that didn't work either
42:46
because then God bought the Ice Age and
42:48
he was sitting on a block of ice you got
42:53
to picture this
42:54
all right this is a reality movie from
42:59
heaven when he was first cast out of
43:04
heaven the dinosaurs were on the earth
43:06
there was there was no sin on you
43:09
there's no darkness on is an evil on the
43:11
earth okay he brought that with him he
43:13
began to make it a wilderness the
43:15
dinosaurs began to kill each other
43:16
because in the beginning they didn't I
43:18
saw it I saw those when he made it the
43:20
first time the dinosaurs walked with the
43:24
watcher angels they left footprints the
43:28
angels in the ground
43:30
and scientists are still trying to
43:32
figure out how they can make it into
43:33
cavemen because they have blocks of like
43:37
stone with a put a human footprint they
43:40
think and dinosaur prints God put
43:43
watcher angels on the earth to care for
43:45
them watch your angels yeah they had
43:49
flesh on them this is reality movie this
43:55
is reality movie night and they were
44:00
here to care for the dinosaurs in God so
44:04
I'm not tolerating this anymore you know
44:06
he's going to take over the earth so God
44:08
broke the water vapor shield that
44:09
covered the earth what mist on the
44:11
ground so the dinosaurs skin would fall
44:13
off there'd been no storms on the earth
44:15
at one point until of course they heard
44:18
cracks of lightning and then here comes
44:19
all the other stuff on the earth it
44:22
began to make it a wilderness God wasn't
44:24
going to tolerate it so the water vapor
44:26
shield he put around the earth which
44:27
every one of your family members has
44:29
already seen this in heaven you go into
44:32
this place called creation lab and God
44:34
recorded all of it you get to actually
44:35
see how he made the heavens in the earth
44:38
they know how all of it happened and
44:41
that amazing so everybody gets to find
44:45
that out they know a whole lot up there
44:48
and so yeah so God broke the water vapor
44:52
shield at flood of years totally covered
44:53
the whole earth and then he blew on it
44:55
and froze and there is Satan with all of
44:57
his plans wash down the tubes again
44:59
because now we've got a block of ice and
45:01
you can do nothing on it and there's the
45:03
Ice Age
45:06
somebody didn't enjoy it God removed his
45:11
glory all cos and I said darkness
45:13
covered the earth and then we have verse
45:16
2 that was all in verse 1 then comes
45:24
verse 2 and darkness was on the face of
45:28
the deep right the Spirit of God was
45:30
hovering over the waters is that correct
45:31
over the waters he didn't say that was
45:33
ground over the waters because in the
45:36
beginning he made it and it was good he
45:40
created in the beginning of time in
45:43
space
45:44
he made this plane to earth and it was
45:47
finished it was finishing it was good
45:49
created he created that was past tense
45:53
right and then we come to verse 2 so
45:55
something happened between those two
45:56
verses a whole lot because then he
46:01
starts to take it apart and put it back
46:03
together is that what he says yes there
46:07
was water on everything water on the sky
46:09
water on the land he took the water off
46:12
the permanent that was the air that was
46:15
the sky that was in the ground of the
46:17
ground I'm doing my emotions again
46:18
people my staff say don't do that but my
46:23
hands move ok I'm saying how BAM
46:28
he began to take it apart it clearly
46:30
explains to you what he did right so he
46:33
was going to recreate the earth or he
46:36
would not have told the animals to
46:40
replenisher
46:41
the earth did you get that word read
46:47
that's like you remodel your home you
46:50
can't remodel a home that was never
46:51
there
46:52
you can't replenish the earth if it
46:54
wasn't there before so that's what he
46:58
did everybody in heaven is already
47:00
seeing everything I'm telling you about
47:01
he began to take everything apart right
47:03
so that he could then redo the earth and
47:07
then he begin to make the animals and
47:08
all the life back on the earth all the
47:10
growth was back on the earth again and
47:11
then he did something different than he
47:13
hadn't done before he's going to make
47:16
man in that amazing
47:20
and then there was the word stepped out
47:23
of the fall to begin to form Adams body
47:25
and he looks pretty good I've seen Adam
47:29
and Eve in heaven yes they have clothes
47:31
and yes you will have clothing you
47:39
actually get a wardrobe he can afford
47:42
more than two garments for you aren't
47:47
you glad I get asked that question all
47:52
the time you well your souls exposed on
47:57
your shoes own the soul is exposed yes
48:06
ask somebody but the soul your foot is
48:09
if you need help just take your shoe off
48:10
and look at it the soles exposed on your
48:16
on the bottom of your foot you're always
48:18
touching the ground to heaven they still
48:24
have boots they have sandals they have
48:26
all kinds of shoes they are to wear
48:27
beautiful things amazing things and some
48:30
of them talk to you your clothing will
48:34
change colors and your clothes will
48:35
change on you while you're walking down
48:37
the street if you cannot decide what you
48:39
should have worn and you picked out
48:42
three things as you walk each one will
48:44
come on you women
48:48
[Applause]
48:51
heaven is not normal
48:54
concerning the service it's heaven where
49:00
I is not seen nor ear heard and entered
49:02
in the heart or mind of man regarding
49:04
favor those that love him except in the
49:06
last is revealed by the Spirit of God so
49:10
that means it can be revealed right he's
49:14
doing that at an accelerated rate and
49:16
he's shown me a lot on purpose so he
49:21
wasted hell I'm going to go back to the
49:23
third day that's okay he wasted how the
49:27
first day Christ goes along that contact
49:29
him I'll wait and see if God blesses him
49:30
and he didn't come and he had taken him
49:35
into the bay it grabbed him put him in
49:36
the far reaches up not the outer reaches
49:39
I've seen there gee don't wanna know
49:40
about the other witches of hell okay the
49:42
far reaches of hell they dragged him
49:44
back what could it gonna do it's a god
49:47
of she shows up right what are you gonna
49:50
do you can't hide anything nothing is
49:52
hidden from God but they thought well
49:54
we'll just put him back here and hold
49:56
him the second day came and he didn't
49:58
show up
49:58
so Satan thinking well I am and now I'm
50:00
stronger than him I was smarter than him
50:03
but it didn't work but he still lost
50:05
part of his brain because he really
50:07
thought he's going to win and he was
50:08
going to put on a show to torture the
50:09
son of God in front of all of his
50:11
hierarchy so he sent out a message for
50:14
all the principalities and powers come
50:15
in and sit on the front row and he moved
50:18
up from the back of hell to the front
50:20
where the gates out there's a courtyard
50:22
the gates of hell the really gates there
50:24
and they could see from Abraham's bosom
50:26
he says put a show on the only ones who
50:28
could see would be Abraham's bosom right
50:30
she's going to put a show on showing me
50:32
he's more powerful than God my church of
50:34
the son of God
50:35
he wasn't the one that was gonna torture
50:39
so here comes the third day right he's
50:43
got everything set up all the
50:45
principalities and powers the big guys
50:46
are all sitting right there in the front
50:48
row
50:48
I actually was I saw that I was there I
50:50
saw all the little demons screaming and
50:52
yelling all they did was scream and yell
50:53
and complain complain and yell and
50:55
blaspheme and complain and yelling
50:57
buzzing they all the time because
50:58
they're always everybody none of those
51:00
demons like each other they were to
51:03
outdo
51:03
out lie out cheat whatever they can
51:07
that's what they do to each other and so
51:10
they were like they were full of herself
51:11
because they were on the front row and
51:12
all the other ones were behind them in a
51:14
little while though they were going to
51:15
be glad they weren't on the front road
51:18
Satan put all his kingly attire on he
51:22
had made and all of his false gems well
51:26
he had the gems God still put on him if
51:28
you didn't know God put gemstones on him
51:31
for a reason he had a reason he put he
51:34
made mountings like in a ring and set
51:36
these amazing beautiful gems they were
51:39
like thousands of them on him and he was
51:43
glorious he was glorious so he still had
51:45
that glory he thought it was his he's
51:47
going to lose it did you know what the
51:50
word does it says Christ would he do say
51:54
it loud
51:55
yeah that's what he stripped he took
51:58
every single gemstone off of him that
52:00
God put on him so here's the shows about
52:03
to begin Satan's been upon show he was
52:05
talking all of his hierarchy right and
52:07
here's Jesus not saying a word just like
52:10
his father he wasn't saying a word and
52:12
then all of a sudden there was a roll of
52:15
thunder and all of his attention was
52:19
gotten because they remembered what
52:21
happens after that roll of thunder comes
52:23
lightning is going to show up somewhere
52:26
and then Jesus Christ stands up and
52:29
there is a shout from heaven and Jesus
52:31
Christ
52:33
starts releasing the fire of God from
52:35
himself and melted the faces of all the
52:38
hierarchy of Hell he began to fade began
52:41
to burn in the midst of Hell fire with
52:43
the fire of God literally like blue fire
52:46
was shooting on his hand and I saw them
52:48
melt like West's because as a little
52:50
girl I would see them in different
52:52
places I saw these demons and their
52:53
faces were melted like that and like wax
52:57
and I used to think what is that what
52:59
did that what did that was about to find
53:02
out and I mean literally saw them melted
53:04
it says he ruined and spoiled
53:08
principalities and powers and made a
53:12
show of it openly and that's what he did
53:15
he literally rule
53:16
they can't go back they've never been
53:18
able to fix their self okay Satan can't
53:21
fix you if you're in the army of
53:23
darkness and you get wounded he can't
53:24
heal you
53:25
they got parts missing you can't you
53:29
can't make them cease to exist but they
53:31
get wounded they don't get healed okay
53:34
I've seen them the Holy Spirit calls
53:37
them shabby debris and if you knew Holy
53:41
Spirit liked it that's exactly what he
53:43
would say because I see the host going
53:46
across the sky all the time I'm a seer I
53:48
see them I see the demonic armies after
53:51
they've been in a battle with the hosts
53:53
of heaven they're hanging on for dear
53:54
life because nobody wants to help each
53:56
other like hanging on they have these
53:58
horrific looks on their face because
54:00
they've just been wiped out by the hosts
54:01
of heaven and I said man they look
54:05
really bad in the Holy Spirit said I
54:06
call that shabby debris and I go I can't
54:11
think of a better thing to call it
54:14
because they look like debris
54:17
you know something washes up on the
54:19
shore where parts of it are missing that
54:22
was down
54:23
[Music]
54:28
we better be glad they don't work
54:30
together well right we're glad they
54:33
don't even like each other right because
54:35
the hosts look out for each other they
54:38
protect each other look out for each
54:39
other they're there for each other hell
54:41
is just the opposite nobody cares about
54:43
anybody so here comes shabby debris they
54:47
look like shabby debris that day in hell
54:50
and this is what Jesus was saying you
54:53
will never have the power to hold a
54:55
righteous man in this place
55:02
and anyone who received Christ they will
55:05
never be able to take you there or hold
55:08
you there amen and when he was done
55:12
wasting the principalities and powers
55:14
then he turns to their leader they ran
55:18
they didn't wait around to see what was
55:20
going to happen to him they abandon him
55:22
they left him they were running over top
55:24
of a little demons trying to get out of
55:26
the space they were happy they weren't
55:28
on the front row that day it worked on
55:32
their behalf and all of Abraham's bosom
55:35
were shouting and cheering and yelling
55:39
and celebrating because they'd already
55:46
given themself to him had their is their
55:48
Messiah wiping out the devil he
55:52
literally he literally ripped his
55:55
clothes off threw him on the dirt and
55:57
one by one took every single gemstone
55:59
away from him and he was left with none
56:01
it was ugly because all he had was he
56:04
spiky little settings that God had put
56:06
all over in his wings and his beings he
56:10
was decorated by God and now he has put
56:14
false ones in there he's made false ones
56:18
they don't look anything like what he
56:19
did but he was he was utterly totally
56:22
completely defeated
56:24
he is a doormat he is not over you he is
56:29
under you
56:30
he is under our feet so what is under
56:33
your feet on your feet is a doormat is
56:38
that what he says then don't be afraid
56:42
of him we're not supposed to have any
56:46
fear in us right and the fear of the
56:48
Lord is not that you will be afraid that
56:50
he will hurt you it is you're afraid you
56:54
will hurt him you so in love with him
56:58
you don't want to do anything that would
57:00
hurt the Lord that's what the fear of
57:03
the Lord is the fear of the Lord is the
57:05
beginning of wisdom and with all your
57:10
getting of wisdom get understanding
57:12
which is knowledge of
57:14
the holy one don't you don't you love
57:19
the word I love it in that good so there
57:22
you go that was a reality show from
57:24
heaven and then he did the the most the
57:31
greatest insult he did the Satan which
57:34
to take something that not just his he
57:36
took her you know he had no pride life
57:38
really early stripped him of all his
57:40
glory and he fell because of that glory
57:43
but he did something even worse than
57:45
that he took away authority he took away
57:50
authority that he had gained because
57:51
Adam gave it to him and he had been
57:54
ruling with that authority until
57:56
something changed that's one of the
57:58
reasons like Christ had to come he had
58:00
to come he had to walk as a man like you
58:03
and i choosing not to friend say not to
58:05
sin he had to choose that with his own
58:09
will not to sin because him being not
58:12
just righteous but holy okay and then
58:15
him being going into hell may think that
58:18
they could keep him it was devastating
58:20
to the enemy when he realized we should
58:22
have never taken him cuz i said if they
58:23
had known they would have never done it
58:26
right
58:27
it was bushwhacked time the enemy was
58:31
bushwhacked by the Son of God and so he
58:34
expands our F he stripped almost all the
58:36
gemstones off of them he reaches down
58:38
and takes away the keys keys represent
58:43
authority they have always represented
58:47
Authority and you know that if the
58:50
wealthiest man in a city back in Christ
58:52
time and even before that the wealthiest
58:55
people were given the keys to the city
58:58
did you know that that's not just
59:00
something we do here on earth you know
59:03
when you see someone comes to Halloween
59:05
order they come to a state they does
59:06
something great like Oral Roberts was
59:09
actually given the key to Oklahoma City
59:11
by the mayor the mayor the governor one
59:14
of them and they actually redeemed their
59:16
self because they weren't on on God's
59:19
high list because of the way they had
59:21
treated Oral Roberts they scorned him
59:23
they made fun of him they judged him
59:26
criticized him
59:27
in the media and the newspapers but
59:30
before he died
59:31
somebody got smart and they apologized
59:35
to him in public they gave him the key
59:38
to the city not just the city after the
59:40
game to see the key to that city but
59:43
also I think the governor in the mayor
59:44
were both there apologized repented on
59:47
behalf of all those who had mistreated
59:48
him recognized him for the contribution
59:51
that he had done for them and so they
59:53
gave him the key to the city that's
59:55
still significant today when you have a
59:58
key but the wealthy people were always
60:01
sat in the city gate back in Jesus times
60:04
and before that in Abraham's day the
60:06
wealthy people sat in the city gate with
60:08
the elders and they were recognized
60:10
because they gave contributions to help
60:13
the city and said they were given keys
60:16
and they were given money bags and they
60:20
had Authority they had to say over what
60:22
went on in that city they were
60:24
recognized by the wisdom because of the
60:26
wealth and so that's just something
60:27
that's always been well he lost all of
60:29
it and held that day he lost all of his
60:32
authority all of his glory all of his a
60:36
lot of respect from the demonic because
60:39
they realized then at that very moment
60:41
our lives aren't going to be the same
60:43
because now we can be wasted by anyone
60:46
who is righteous can waste us everyone
60:49
who receives him will now have power
60:52
over us so their lives were changing
60:57
even say his life was changing he had to
61:00
get a lot better at deception because he
61:03
no longer had those keys to hell death
61:07
and the grave and I probably won't have
61:11
time to go into tonight but Christ uses
61:12
those keys he uses them for us you
61:18
should be really happy about that amen
61:21
we have so many promises given to no one
61:24
no one else in the earth except those
61:26
who receive Jesus Christ you have great
61:29
power on the inside of you have great
61:30
authority you have already been given
61:32
Dominion on the earth don't don't act
61:35
like you're nothing don't say you're
61:37
nothing
61:37
you have great value everybody person
61:40
every
61:40
one here is valued by God everyone here
61:43
was given a gift to use in the natural
61:46
realm in heaven you're going to use that
61:51
gift whether it's baking cookies making
61:55
a really amazing barbecue designing
61:58
apparel designing interior design
62:00
designing amusement parks making movies
62:04
in heaven
62:05
sports in heaven our plate is worship
62:10
yellow really quiet how many people have
62:12
never heard me talk about this before I
62:14
know someone who has let me see your
62:16
hands okay it makes sense because God
62:21
gave you that gift
62:22
they are irrevocable as a matter of fact
62:26
even the wicked have their gifts and
62:28
they won't be taken away from them you
62:29
choose how to use that gift in the earth
62:32
that's why there's people who belong to
62:34
Satan and they have gifts to act or sing
62:38
or whatever it is and what they produce
62:40
is dark because their heart is dark
62:44
they're going to have the gifts no
62:45
matter what amen but your gift is so
62:50
important that that God calls it
62:52
precious is something special he called
62:55
you you are a gift every good and
62:58
perfect gift that's you comes down from
63:02
the Father of lights that was you you
63:06
were like you were made of light
63:08
he knit you together in your mother's
63:10
womb at the time of conception the
63:12
spiritual body made our light was knit
63:14
together with that physical little dot
63:16
of flesh and that's when life begins but
63:19
when you came you had you were that gift
63:22
already whether it was someone who was
63:24
going to sing or be a musician dance
63:27
create a clothing apparel food spices
63:31
roads highways anything you see in this
63:36
place was created by somebody it was
63:38
designed and invented by somebody you
63:40
wouldn't have anything to wear to walk
63:42
on to sleep on to sit on to look at
63:45
entertainment places to go and enjoy
63:47
yourself you wouldn't have highways to
63:49
drive on planes to go in those were
63:51
gifts God
63:53
people to be and all those gifts are
63:57
used in heaven for everybody who lives
64:00
there
64:00
so it's not boring yes they have
64:06
stylists there they have salons there
64:08
they color your hair with light this is
64:13
heaven culture everyone in heaven has
64:15
color in their hair so we're at it's
64:23
like art it's considered a form of art
64:26
okay they also have the culinary arts in
64:29
heaven everybody eats food and they love
64:33
it
64:34
it tastes better than anything you've
64:36
had on the earth and don't argue with me
64:39
because the mirror supper of the lamb is
64:41
not grapes and crackers if the Lord of
64:47
glory was going to have a supper he made
64:51
everything never insisted he's not going
64:53
to give you just grapes
64:56
they'll be unending food everywhere
65:01
everything you've loved to eat with no
65:03
weight gain or food allergies and I
65:09
happen to know that that wedding supper
65:12
is going to last a long long time he has
65:22
a really big house this is just reality
65:30
time I guess we're having a reality
65:32
heaven show of things that happened
65:35
throughout time okay
65:37
even Elijah loves to tell the story of
65:40
the profits of ale because he saw what
65:43
happened in the spirit realm when all
65:45
that went on so when you go to heaven
65:48
now and he shares that has a whole
65:50
different meaning like when you get to
65:54
heaven and you get to see how Christ
65:56
wasted hell you will shout and scream
65:59
forever there was a day Satan was kicked
66:05
out there was a day he was crushed down
66:08
he had authority stripped from him he
66:11
was unseated from his authority that he
66:14
operated in the earth for generations
66:16
and ages because something new was
66:19
happening the Messiah was on the earth
66:21
and then he went and died for us so that
66:26
every everything you ever commit when
66:28
you repent and say when I repair it will
66:31
be forgiven he will cleanse me from all
66:34
unrighteousness like it never happened
66:43
heaven absolutely celebrates every time
66:46
somebody gives yourself to Christ
66:49
especially all the family members who
66:51
never get to never missed that every
66:52
family member saw all of your family get
66:55
born again they saw the babies being
66:58
born they saw the weddings every
67:01
birthday on your birthday they go in
67:03

and there's your food right there where
69:25
you watch the movie the movie that is
69:28
being captured probably not far from
69:31
where you're at
69:32
showing instantaneously Indy Cedars in
69:34
heaven they're called reality theaters
69:36
it was a very first place they took me
69:40
they could have taken me anywhere 1996 I
69:44
was caught up to have him for the first
69:46
time Jesus warns me walked through the
69:49
wall in my home I was doing dishes
69:50
although I spent a lot of time in prayer
69:53
it wasn't during that time he walked in
69:54
while I was washing dishes not my
69:57
favorite thing to do I tell people I'm
69:59
not Susie homemaker okay I am a business
70:02
person but of course I raised three
70:05
daughters I was a wife I had to take
70:08
care of my home while I was doing
70:09
everything else at the same time and so
70:12
Jesus walked through the wall on my home
70:13
he said go sit down the father and I are
70:16
going to start taking you on tours of
70:17
heaven and I didn't say no and the first
70:23
place it took me was still a fun place
70:25
because I knew there was a throne room I
70:28
knew there were certain places already
70:30
in heaven I knew they were there I knew
70:31
about the River of Life it talks about
70:33
it in the Word of God it says heaven is
70:35
a country and it's a city so I knew they
70:37
had both even if I hadn't seen him I
70:39
knew they were both there go read
70:40
Hebrews eight correct it's in Hebrew a
70:43
writer says heaven is a city it's the
70:45
country yeah so go read and Hebrews
70:48
actually talks a lot about heaven that's
70:50
what the great cloud of witnesses has
70:51
talked about the great people of faith
70:53
have passed onto so go read Hebrews it
70:56
talks about heaven
70:57
so I knew there were certain things
70:58
there cut and I was delighted I thought
71:02
there was probably something fun to do I
71:03
didn't realize that heaven is almost
71:05
50/50 have fun and have profound because
71:12
when his children came on me I have
71:13
something for them to enjoy and do and
71:16
so yeah I was the first place I was
71:18
taken Jesus came into person yes I knew
71:22
it was him I'd actually seen him quite a
71:24
few times on the earth before he walked
71:25
through the wall of my home I've known
71:27
him since I was four years old I got
71:29
saved twice h4 and h5 and this was 1996
71:34
when this happened so I had had and
71:36
encounters with angels I could see I was
71:39
always a seed see the demonic operations
71:41
I see Heaven's operations all around me
71:44
my grandmother had some of that and her
71:46
my dad had encountered angels it was a
71:49
way of life
71:50
it wasn't like strange something strange
71:52
to me but it was absolutely delightful
71:55
to see that there's so many fun things
71:57
to do in heaven and what's in my books
72:01
our encounters I had and how people got
72:04
stunned when God would take me up let me
72:06
stand by the family members who had just
72:07
passed away I heard them talking about
72:09
their life on earth I knew the family
72:11
members names I knew what they look like
72:12
even though I had never met them on the
72:14
earth then God would walk me through the
72:16
mansions I would see how the mansion was
72:18
built I knew what was on their property
72:20
and then he would bring me back down and
72:22
then he would give me their family
72:24
members names and phone numbers on the
72:26
earth if he can take you to heaven and
72:30
show you stuff if he knows every hair on
72:32
your head
72:33
he knows all your phone numbers right
72:37
and I would write it down he'd have me
72:39
call it he had me type everything down I
72:41
heard and saw and then I would call
72:44
these people and say I didn't have pink
72:46
hair back then managed to do that okay
72:48
he still shows me people but but when I
72:50
started this whole thing I didn't have
72:52
being care and I say I believe God has
72:55
shown me something about your family
72:56
member and have them would you like to
72:58
know what it is and I didn't know these
73:00
people I didn't know they didn't know
73:01
how I got their number I didn't want to
73:03
tell me I got the number I just said God
73:06
has shown me something and they will go
73:08
who are you talking about and I say
73:09
their family members
73:10
name he would get David I couldn't see
73:14
buddy they were shaking on the other end
73:16
of the line they go yes I want to know
73:21
will you meet me at the mall will you
73:23
meet me at the park because they sure
73:25
weren't going to invite me to their home
73:27
they never want to take me to their home
73:29
they never ever ever took me to their
73:31
home and I would show up and I would
73:33
have everything typed down on a piece of
73:35
paper God even gave it a title did you
73:38
know God loves name things he gave it a
73:40
title like it was a script and I wrote
73:43
it like it was a script I put to
73:44
everything in clothes that Jesus said
73:46
that I heard them say you know I
73:48
described the aromas the emotions the
73:52
colors everything the frequencies that
73:56
were there how they traveled what was in
73:59
their mansion what it looked like what
74:00
their favorite colors were what their
74:02
gift was because they were using their
74:03
gift and I didn't know anything of them
74:06
and I tell them to sit down and I would
74:08
hold the paper up here so I didn't look
74:10
at him and I just began to read and I
74:12
would hear then laugh and cry and cry
74:16
and laugh and laugh and cry and they
74:18
would shake and when I was done I'd say
74:20
do you believe God showed me just about
74:22
your family member and happen and it
74:24
wasn't for me it was for them and they
74:27
go I don't know you I never met you but
74:31
you told me things only my family member
74:33
would know so I have to believe you saw
74:36
my family member they were so absolutely
74:39
undone and then they began to tell me
74:41
they confirmed what I saw because I knew
74:43
what they were doing in a new third it
74:45
was because you use that gift in heaven
74:46
whether they were a florist in heaven or
74:48
they're designing apparel in heaven
74:50
whether they were over the use in heaven
74:53
which the thirteen-year-old girl was put
74:55
over the youth of heaven and she was 13
74:57
and her whole life she planned to be a
75:01
youth pastor and she mentored kids in
75:05
her elementary school in her middle
75:06
school everybody loved her I heard from
75:10
her mother after I shared all the stuff
75:11
I saw her with a great grandfather that
75:12
looked like he was in 20s and he was
75:14
taking her on rollercoaster rides in the
75:16
amusement park and I mean huge roller
75:20
coasters like the biggest ones called
75:21
the rush at leasts off the track goes
75:23
across the sky
75:24
to another part of the track yeah I
75:31
thought it was pretty cool and the wild
75:35
thing was the Angels were riding them
75:36
too they were riding them too I could
75:45
not see the end of this amusement park
75:47
up in there three times I could not see
75:48
the end to it
75:49
kids got in bubbles and rode over in
75:52
bubbles or you went by you and learn how
75:55
to fly like Superman then you flew over
75:57
it guess who teaches you how to fly
76:01
[Music]
76:02
Christopher Reeve I hear your thoughts
76:10
he got born again he got born again what
76:17
did you do on earth it was Superman
76:21
right he teaches you to fly in heaven so
76:29
I'm telling you this is all this is in
76:31
my first trip to have it and I remember
76:34
every aroma every emotion I remember
76:37
every word that people said I remember
76:39
every creature that I saw what they look
76:41
like the flowers saying they change
76:42
colors the hosts of heaven were there
76:44
there was beautiful angels that were
76:46
green like dust like green emerald us
76:49
except Dells or waterfalls and they care
76:51
for the waterfalls and the streams in
76:52
heaven and they were feminine-looking
76:57
they were so captivating this song was
76:59
so captivating so I remember all that
77:02
and my first trip in Christ remember
77:05
Christ took me aside before he brought
77:07
me back and he goes I want you to tell
77:09
them on the earth there'll be many
77:11
people in heaven they never expected to
77:12
see there but they prayed them in
77:16
if they don't give up on them we will
77:19
not give up on them if you belong to me
77:22
I won't let your words drop to the
77:23
ground and I got undone I think it was
77:27
the most spectacular thing that happened
77:28
when I was there was when he told me
77:30
that because he said it will give hope
77:32
to so many people because he's a good
77:35
god
77:35
isn't he and so I saw this young girl
77:39
was talking to a great grandfather as
77:41
they're walking down this path going to
77:43
when you're going into a new part of
77:45
heaven there's gates that are always
77:46
open there's just like columns of gates
77:48
as not walls inside heaven and that's
77:52
they were going through these big purple
77:53
and gold gates and they were going to
77:55
the amusement park I didn't know that at
77:56
the time and so the Lord said get up
77:59
there so you can hear what that young
78:01
girl's saying and she was talking about
78:02
her mom that they had a great
78:04
relationship my mom again I'm going to
78:05
kiss her in both cheeks I'm going to
78:07
share everything has happened to me up
78:09
here in heaven I wish she knew I was a
78:10
youth leader in heaven and then she just
78:14
kept talking then I saw them going to a
78:16
rollercoaster rides and then Christ
78:18
brought me back and I got her mom's
78:20
number in Colliver and the funeral had
78:23
just happened and she was at that time
78:25
her only daughter and although I was
78:29
told later that she was profited over by
78:32
a prophetess that she would have a very
78:33
short life but she wouldn't act the
78:35
whole world for Christ which she was
78:38
because of the testimony and so when I
78:41
was sharing this with her mom
78:42
outside JC Penney's at a table at the
78:46
mall she got undone and she began to
78:50
tell me after I told her all the stuff I
78:51
saw I saw on the roller coasters I heard
78:53
the words that she said and she was
78:56
crying and weeping and she said that
78:57
what I told you I've never known you
78:59
never met you I don't know you but you
79:02
said things only my daughter knew she
79:03
goes the day before she died the day
79:05
before they buried her I was in her room
79:07
and I saw a journal under her bed that
79:09
was written she was like 7 her daughter
79:11
was 13 when she passed away she said I
79:13
start to go through it look at the pages
79:15
and I found written on the pages these
79:17
words last night I dreamed I died early
79:20
and went to heaven early I saw my
79:22
great-grandfather and I went on
79:23
rollercoaster rides
79:24
I didn't know that journal is a derp it
79:29
was wonderful but he only gave me a peek
79:31
so as fast as a rollercoaster I fell
79:33
back to earth and her mother was the
79:36
only one who knew about that journal and
79:38
I didn't know her mother you know what
79:41
God was doing he was givin me evidence
79:43
that heaven was not only real but it was
79:45
fun she said her daughter every day
79:48
would kiss on both cheeks before she
79:50
went to school when she came home she
79:51
shared everything that had happened to
79:54
her life in her life during that day and
79:56
she had planned her whole life to be a
79:58
leader a youth pastor and a leader that
80:01
was her goal and she was doing that in
80:03
heaven at age 13 I heard her say you
80:07
know that I'm cheering my mom on you
80:10
know she didn't know she couldn't see me
80:12
okay people never saw me in heaven but I
80:15
heard all these words and she said that
80:16
she was a cheerleader and her favorite
80:19
colors were blue and white she was
80:20
learning a blue light tunic top and pant
80:22
when I saw her it was her favorite color
80:24
even on notice so you still have your
80:26
favorite colors in heaven and so all
80:28
these things everything I said that I
80:30
wrote down that I remembered was
80:32
significant to her she'd never been the
80:34
same since then she said she was my only
80:37
daughter they tell me I can't have
80:38
children God said tell her that she will
80:40
have children I'll give her children and
80:42
she has two twins right now ten year old
80:45
twins with strawberry blonde hair like
80:47
Marissa head blue eyes and star brave on
80:49
here twins and they have encounters in
80:51
heaven so we have a good God that cares
80:58
about you that cares about me you won't
81:00
miss your destiny when you go to heaven
81:03
none of your children will mr. destiny
81:06
whatever he chose them to be here and
81:08
that gift he gave them it was a dancer
81:11
to be a dancer in heaven if it was a
81:12
cookie Baker to be a cookie Baker in
81:14
heaven if it was a fisherman there'll be
81:16
a fisherman in heaven if it was to
81:18
create and invent all kinds of neat a
81:20
high-tech gadgets actually have a place
81:23
called techno city in heaven where all
81:26
the geeks live
81:28
and they can create all kinds of just
81:32
the wildest craziest things you even
81:35
beyond what we have here on the earth
81:37
although I saw some of those being
81:39
brought to the earth because they have
81:41
ideas owned in heaven and you see all
81:45
these little sparkles in it like a
81:46
million little pieces of glitter and
81:49
every one of them is an idea and
81:50
invention and God sends he takes a wave
81:53
of that and sends it over the earth and
81:54
it drops all these ideas and inventions
81:56
in our minds and whoever grabs that idea
82:01
and creates that idea that's why I see
82:04
things on the earth already that I've
82:06
seen in heaven because they come from
82:10
him does it say that they come from him
82:12
yeah that's how we send them and then
82:16
amazing so God has a lot of plans for us
82:21
right here on this earth right now
82:23
everybody in here is special because
82:26
you're alive right now
82:27
everyone in heaven is cheering you on to
82:30
run your to run your race right now in
82:32
this kingdom age to live heaven culture
82:35
to demonstrate and manifest for God it's
82:38
not about how much education you've had
82:40
it's not about what race you're born in
82:43
it has nothing to do with any of that it
82:46
has to do that you belong to Jesus
82:48
Christ that you have given your life to
82:49
him you've received him he put you here
82:52
for a purpose he gave you authority
82:54
power weapons he's now going to add to
82:57
that creativity and invention say I
82:59
receive it and he's also right now in
83:03
this time and people are always asking
83:05
me you know when you're going to start
83:08
creating things and put it in the
83:09
marketplace because I will create heaven
83:11
on earth not just reveal heaven on earth
83:14
my first assignment was reveal it my
83:16
second one is to create it we're going
83:19
to create many products and things they
83:20
haven't haven't apparel games things for
83:23
children we're going to produce movies
83:25
in the earth places to go for
83:26
entertainment for everybody to enjoy
83:29
architecture and interior design we're
83:32
going to create walls that will talk to
83:33
you and it will have movement in them
83:37
you won't just paint your walls anymore
83:40
you don't paying them you want wallpaper
83:42
you're going to get parts of heaven and
83:44
put them on there your new technology is
83:47
coming where you'll learn how to paint
83:49
masterpieces with a light wand
83:51
I saw people with drive-through tattoo
83:57
parlors and they put it on with light
83:59
like what marking belongs to God it was
84:06
stolen by the enemy and he put his marks
84:09
on people for generations there's a
84:12
scripture in Psalms that says some
84:15
people worship me in in song some and
84:18
dance and some will put my marks on them
84:22
Joyce Myers read that now she's getting
84:24
a tattoo if Joyce Myers can do I don't
84:29
know who can say I'm not going to do it
84:30
I don't know anybody here's this
84:34
conservative hosting reel as Joyce I
84:38
love Joyce everybody say thank God for
84:41
Joyce she keeps us real doesn't she I
84:45
can't wait to see what she's going to
84:47
pick we're living in a new time like I
84:51
was explaining John the Baptist brought
84:54
a new time with him there were new ways
84:57
to do things okay that had nothing to do
85:00
with the past and a lot of people
85:02
rejected it because they knew God had
85:05
said to do it this way
85:06
well in that time he did things a
85:09
certain way he himself doesn't never
85:10
change but he is a great creator and he
85:12
does bring new things to the earth all
85:14
the time and people go well if I can't
85:17
see it line by line written well it
85:19
doesn't say he's going to have
85:20
microwaves do you have one
85:22
it doesn't say you'll have cellphones
85:24
but do you own one okay it doesn't even
85:27
talk about cars but do you have one yes
85:31
because as time goes by new things are
85:35
brought to the earth and invented that
85:37
we use to improve our life is that
85:40
correct that so that doesn't mean
85:44
there's going to be that you won't see
85:45
new things you've never seen before and
85:47
these are things I'm talking about that
85:50
will help all of humanity to either in
85:52
to either make your life easier
85:54
or to make you have a happier life a
85:57
healthier life a more informed life
86:00
there are new things coming to this
86:02
earth
86:03
I saw roads that we traveled on that
86:05
were made out of light and the fuel was
86:08
the light I glad something's excited I
86:16
was shown these new things we will have
86:19
hologram computers we can reach in and
86:23
take the things out of the light and
86:24
look at them then put them back in there
86:26
I saw several major diseases including
86:34
cancer that did not even exist on the
86:37
earth it will be abolished just think
86:42
how much that will change your life new
86:44
fuels one is coming from outer space are
86:48
[Music]
86:51
y'all excited say Amen because you're
86:54
staring at me do you know how much that
87:00
will change our life we won't need the
87:05
fuel from the desert or the sheiks we
87:10
won't even need the coal from
87:12
underground ok we won't even need solar
87:15
energy I'm not talking about solar
87:17
energy a whole fuel that God already put
87:21
up there and all they need is the night
87:24
the right receiver to bring it down in
87:27
the transmitters in everybody's home to
87:29
fuel your entire home and I saw what
87:31
they look like they're about this big
87:34
and you can move it wherever you want to
87:38
you got in the middle of desert and camp
87:40
and have have energy
87:45
your bug zappers won't be flyswatters
87:48
anymore because I take one when I go and
87:55
I want one that big because I don't like
88:00
bugs when I 16 at a youth camp and I was
88:05
finally invited to a banquet by someone
88:06
who was brave
88:08
my mama bought me this pretty dress had
88:11
white lace sleeves here my neck was up
88:13
to here and I went and took that thing I
88:15
was hanging in the cabin I went on walk
88:16
out to go meet my date for the banquet
88:18
and something was moving up my sleeve
88:21
how are you told you I don't like it
88:24
want no little bug it was just big and
88:27
it was crawling up my arm this way and I
88:33
was really shy so I was going to tell
88:35
anybody it was one of those grasshoppers
88:38
black and red ones you know those things
88:41
look like they came either from hell or
88:44
from some other planet those like they
88:48
could take over the world and wanted to
88:51
they had an attitude if you ever looked
88:53
him in the eye I wouldn't I wouldn't
88:56
suggest you do that when I'm here like
89:00
this right trying to calmly talk first
89:05
time in my life I went anywhere with the
89:07
opposite text at all I got this pretty
89:11
dress on and in the sleeves you know I
89:14
was I was real skinny I mean real skinny
89:16
and so that's the only reason why that
89:18
thing was able to get up there and I've
89:20
got lace you know lace does not move
89:22
okay you can't open it up and shake
89:24
something out so this thing is crawling
89:26
further and further and I'm like I'm
89:28
trying to hang on to it right and I'm
89:30
like I thought it was going to faint in
89:32
front of the house that's not going to
89:35
be a good first impression
89:37
I want to excuse me and I was a really
89:40
fast runner I chased my brothers all the
89:42
time for my momma I ran so fast at that
89:45
cabin locked the door and I threw
89:47
everything off I was going to take
89:49
everything and there was that big ugly
89:50
thing this big
89:52
I didn't kill it I didn't want to go
89:54
anywhere near I'm like oh my what I'm
89:56
gonna do I had to wait for it to walk
89:57
away from my clothes so I could put him
90:00
back I to go back out there you know
90:02
about 15 minutes later and he goes are
90:04
you okay I am I'm really good I'm all
90:08
good right now
90:09
and I sent my friends in the cabin to
90:12
for the demise of the grasshopper so
90:16
when I go camping I take big things to
90:19
deal with the bugs but when you get this
90:21
energy from space okay you can get the
90:23
biggest bug zapper and probably put it
90:27
around your entire can't so anything
90:29
that comes up there is going to get
90:30
zapped before it ever gets hot it was
90:34
the most amazing thing it was just like
90:36
a they had this thing that you pulled it
90:38
down from space and everybody had them
90:41
they just had them in their homes
90:43
I saw them line highways and a hologram
90:46
light they don't have lamppost like
90:48
solid like this they have little things
90:50
like this and all they did was have to
90:52
place them where they went and attach
90:54
them to the ground they have one little
90:55
station a little kind of a thing like
90:57
that and when they hit it the light shot
91:00
up from the ground and let the entire
91:01
highway all the way down you didn't have
91:06
to dig in the ground plant wiring run
91:09
all the way down somewhere and hook it
91:11
up to something this was a new form of
91:14
energy that will change our world
91:17
the missionaries wherever they are they
91:20
can have power all the time no matter
91:23
where you are out in the ocean on a boat
91:25
it doesn't matter where you are because
91:26
it's going to draw it down from space
91:28
and he took me quite a while showing me
91:32
this took me into the future and show me
91:33
what this is going to be a great day for
91:34
everybody and he said in your light in
91:37
your lifetime which is probably before
91:39
ever it is going to happen ha ha ha ha
91:42
I'm not planning to die I don't know
91:44
about you I'm staying till he's done
91:49
with me I'll let him choose that man I'm
91:54
not planning to escape on my rapture rod
91:57
because even we can't decide that right
92:00
so I'm just trying I'm just trying to
92:02
share a little bit about what is coming
92:05
into your
92:05
lives it will affect you your kids your
92:08
grandchildren great-grandchildren
92:11
great-great-great great-great-great
92:15
grandchildren there have been quite a
92:19
few people that have been caught up and
92:22
taken over a hundred years into the
92:24
future I've been taking almost 150 years
92:27
into the future and the perilous times
92:30
had not happened but it got better and
92:33
greater and more powerful because the
92:37
body of Christ was standing up and being
92:39
who God called them to be they're no
92:41
longer tolerated darkness or evil they
92:44
weren't participating with it by by
92:46
complaining and saying what they didn't
92:48
have and who they weren't they stopped
92:51
saying words of negativity you can't
92:54
live a positive prosperous life if your
92:58
soul is continually being fed negative
93:00
words you just can't do it and actually
93:03
if all you do is take in the doom and
93:05
gloom you're not even going to be happy
93:07
do you know God told me in order to
93:08
create invent you had to be happy you
93:12
had to be happy you know actually isn't
93:15
happy better than sad do you know
93:19
there's more things released in your
93:21
body that are good when you are happy
93:24
when you're sad and oppression comes
93:26
things stop changing even inside the way
93:30
that your body is forming I don't know
93:32
all those details about that okay I
93:34
don't know those details don't care
93:35
about them I just know that your inward
93:37
workings of your body begin to not be
93:39
good and if you live around negativity
93:43
all the time then that's not good for
93:45
you but you can change the atmosphere
93:47
even where you live go in your room and
93:50
say I'm not participating with all these
93:51
words I'm evicting all these words out
93:53
of the atmosphere of where I live I
93:55
don't have to tolerate them I'm reaching
93:57
the life of God the power of God the
93:59
presence of God right here this is the
94:01
atmosphere I'm going to breathe it
94:02
doesn't matter who owns that place if
94:04
you were there you have the right to
94:06
change the atmosphere you live in you
94:10
can imagine if the body of Christ ever
94:12
gets this about the new time it starts
94:14
operating like that how much change are
94:17
we going to bring we were sent
94:19
here to help change things is that right
94:21
Christ came and changed many things just
94:24
a few short years he was here he rocked
94:28
this world it's our time to put on a
94:33
show this is all about the show begins
94:38
you saw it you heard about the show in
94:40
heaven and let me tell you when all that
94:42
was going on of the deception of the
94:44
Angels it wasn't just like calmly
94:47
quietly done that's not the way it was
94:48
done it was great deception and Lucifer
94:52
never told them I'm going to take over
94:53
me evil and killed still in the story he
94:56
didn't say that to any of those angels
94:57
he said I'm going to be greater than God
95:00
I care more I'm wiser he doesn't know
95:03
what I'm doing he doesn't know what I'm
95:04
saying so I'm going to make sure
95:06
everybody has wealth everybody has power
95:08
we can all celebrate together while I
95:10
rule and then he would have his own
95:13
concerts it said he'd trafficked his
95:15
wares he showed off that he could create
95:19
because he was highly anointed for that
95:22
and he would do then you draw angels to
95:24
himself let me tell you a third of them
95:26
followed him but two thirds didn't
95:29
follow him and angels are real beings
95:33
like you and I they're not married okay
95:36
God had some mercy on him
95:44
I'll be married 40 years to the same
95:47
human being this November and I'm not
95:52
picking anyone else okay been through it
95:55
once didn't you survive Victoria
95:58
actually is still very much in love with
96:00
my husband and everybody knows it's a
96:03
journey isn't it you learn to love and
96:07
die and love and die and love and die
96:10
and loving to hide it to someone dies
96:13
more than the other there's a lot more
96:14
love and then you keep loving you having
96:17
gray so they can finish dying to
96:19
themselves and then it's wonderful but
96:29
you won't be married in heaven
96:30
you'll be best friends you remember you
96:34
were married you'll do things all over
96:36
heaven together and you will show off
96:39
who's your husband who's your wife on
96:41
the earth you celebrate all over heaven
96:44
you go look it isn't she gorgeous
96:46
the most beautiful thing you've seen
96:48
this is who I was married to on earth
96:51
yeah and they won't talk about any of
96:54
the hard times they won't talk about any
96:58
of the crazy times okay oh you share
97:03
them if you had cats you share them
97:10
because you live right next door and
97:14
you're your bot oh you were better
97:21
parents
97:24
they'll probably visit you more often
97:31
you share them it's like children like
97:34
when when um when parents come home to
97:36
having a few if you had a miscarried
97:37
little baby and you get that little baby
97:39
you share them they say with mothers
97:41
they're the father but this is that most
97:43
of those people go everywhere together
97:45
in heaven and and there's no like
97:48
there's not like sleepovers okay
97:49
although people move in and stay with
97:51
you for why I'm just preparing you I'm
97:54
giving you a heads-up warning right now
97:56
when you come home to have it all of
97:59
your family will move into your mansion
98:01
they probably already got their space
98:04
picked out because they have missed you
98:09
and they want to be with you okay this
98:12
is a good news if you're going on a tour
98:14
tell them to enjoy themselves to get
98:16
back only they're probably going to
98:18
follow you on the tour everybody goes on
98:20
tours of heaven it doesn't matter if you
98:25
stay with each other it doesn't matter
98:26
okay I saw oh I call them community
98:29
mansions it was like a big hub like a
98:31
big huge massive common area like
98:34
probably like half a Denver and all for
98:37
this this comes a common area which was
98:41
so supernatural as things you all enjoy
98:43
doing together on the earth it was uh
98:44
even if it could include outdoor stuff
98:46
by the way you can't say was all like
98:48
under a building no I'm talking about it
98:50
was everything you enjoy doing on yours
98:52
together as a family and then off of
98:54
this are all these massive mansions
98:57
coming off almost like a wheel with
98:59
spokes and every spoke would be like I
99:02
don't know
99:02
I saw mansions the size of a city so I
99:05
can't ever even say how big these
99:07
mansions were and so everybody had their
99:10
own space because you come home as his
99:12
son and his daughter okay that's how you
99:17
come home because he is your father when
99:20
you come home you recognize your son and
99:22
your daughter and he gives everybody
99:23
their own space and you will be very
99:25
glad you have it you will love whatever
99:28
it gives you if you're so super now too
99:30
you could never afford to pay for buy or
99:32
even build it here and it's going to be
99:34
built around your gift the thing that is
99:36
your
99:36
action that you love the most and then
99:40
you go on tours all over heaven and
99:42
Christ invites you to his own private
99:43
mansion where he's always a big party
99:46
for you and invites all the disciples
99:47
the Apostles the prophets to come and
99:50
see you and they're coming there to meet
99:51
you
99:52
he sends a special chariot or cherrish
99:56
to come and pick you up and then he has
99:59
you decked out like a king or a queen
100:01
and then you come and he escort you into
100:04
his place and introduces you and
100:06
everybody celebrates that you're there
100:09
and then you eat like forever he has a
100:14
massive ballroom is the biggest part of
100:17
his mansion because he loves to dance
100:18
and on although all down the walls are
100:21
like Kings tables laden with every kind
100:23
of dessert you can imagine and his
100:27
mansion sits in this field of flowers
100:29
that are like six foot tall
100:31
all of them sing the most glorious songs
100:34
they are worshiping the Lord of glory
100:36
they will all know your name they were
100:38
all welcomed you as you come down this
100:40
magnificent drive to say everybody say
100:43
Jesus deserves his own place just like
100:48
us and he has won but he made a way so
100:53
that you won't ever be away from him
100:55
yeah like this reality show tonight some
101:01
people are hearing it for the first time
101:02
if we're live streaming or realized
101:03
streaming some some of these people for
101:05
the first time in their life are
101:06
probably getting rocked you know their
101:09
mind is probably so going bonkers the
101:11
first time I talked to him about
101:12
something because that's what heaven
101:15
does to you when you get there you walk
101:16
around like you don't even know what to
101:21
say you're looking at everything you're
101:23
undone by the ground by the grass by the
101:26
sky by the beings by the sounds the
101:28
images of frequencies people riding on
101:30
the worship you know I mean beams of
101:33
light shooting by and it's a person
101:34
coming from somewhere in heaven you step
101:37
into his transport kiosks that are light
101:39
beams shooting out and you ride on the
101:40
light to places Rania and you're walking
101:43
down these streets of gold if you can't
101:45
you can look in them you can it can
101:47
actually see your image in the streets
101:49
ago it looks like
101:50
I don't know it's transparent gold but
101:53
it's beautiful you can't even tell the
101:54
depth of it you can't
101:56
there's gems everywhere massive gems
101:58
everywhere the mulch and the flowerbeds
102:00
are gems like real gems and the angels
102:04
will come to numbers and grab them up
102:06
and throw them down to the earth and
102:07
that's how they get in the meetings so
102:12
your Europe your being undone by
102:13
everything that you're walking by
102:14
everything that you're seeing in heaven
102:16
and you'll never stop feeling that way
102:19
you will never stop being undone that
102:22
matter of people have been there five
102:24
hundred years a thousand years two
102:27
thousand years they're still surprised
102:29
by God he's always creating new things
102:32
putting new things through they're
102:34
discovering new things it's so huge a
102:36
massive you know I mean one day I don't
102:38
even know if I'll get to see Ellis
102:39
before he makes a new earth and that
102:42
amazing I I love him I love him more
102:48
every day if you go off can you carry
102:51
that because he lets me he lets me carry
102:55
it I have a I have a can you remember in
102:58
the natural I have words anymore I have
103:01
a photographic memory he gave me that
103:04
from the time I was a little kid it
103:05
helped a lot in school I look at a list
103:08
one time you never have to look at again
103:09
I remembered everything it said I'd read
103:11
one thing like you know two weeks later
103:13
we had a test and I would pass every
103:15
test because I remember but he wanted
103:17
somebody with a with a photographic
103:18
memory to do this so they can remember
103:21
everything I remember the thousands of
103:23
times I've been there I remember
103:24
everything I remember every detail
103:28
I remember the aromas will get you
103:30
undone Christ Himself carries an aroma
103:34
and I can go places and I know he was
103:37
there it's beautiful it's a beautiful
103:40
smell but also smelled the other side I
103:43
know when they've been in places and
103:46
it's putrid it smells like death so yes
103:51
they both exist heaven exists hell exist
103:56
just like the Bible says okay you have
103:59
to read the word to know it
104:01
if you don't know the words then it
104:04
can't bring it alive to you if you don't
104:07
read the words you can't bring if you
104:08
can't highlight stuff I know how many
104:10
people ever happen you read a scripture
104:12
so many times in one day you read it and
104:14
it comes alive to you if you read the
104:19
word you are storing it in your soul and
104:22
in a moment when you need it that's how
104:25
come it comes up in you because you put
104:28
it there yourself when you read it I
104:30
play the Bible somewhere in my house and
104:33
it's always feeding my soul you can feed
104:36
your soul at night while you're sleeping
104:38
and I don't know why more believers
104:40
don't but I play powerful anointed
104:44
worship 24 hours a day in my home
104:46
because he inhabits the praises of his
104:49
people whether it's in person or whether
104:52
it's on a CD okay there's anointed sound
104:56
songs frequencies if you play and put
104:59
them in your home it will draw heaven to
105:01
your home you know that's what we should
105:04
all put there right so y'all stand up
105:07
for a minute I want to thank you for
105:08
letting me share I don't want to keep it
105:10
really long because I know I have to be
105:11
back in the morning I was supposed to
105:13
share about some of my products I
105:15
there's one called revealing of the
105:16
Kings it's the spiritual Kings in case
105:20
you didn't know this revelation this is
105:23
the day he's revealing the spiritual
105:25
Kings who will walk in the earth that
105:29
whoever runs after that those are
105:33
eternal levels of authority Christ said
105:36
you will rule and reign with me now
105:38
right
105:39
in the ages to come he will rule with
105:41
him throughout eternity
105:42

105:45
there's lords priests and kings and he
105:51
told me face-to-face
105:52
what I have written on my thigh is not
105:55
natural kings I am the king of spiritual
105:59
kings who will walk in high levels of
106:02
authority in the earth no man can give
106:04
them that title
106:05
they will demonstrate they operate in
106:08
that authority and Dominion in the earth
106:10
and that's how people will know who they
106:11
are
106:12

106:15
we are priests and kings to our God and
106:21

today so far and we haven't seen
02:37
anything yet and so again we want to
02:40
welcome you to the Healing Rooms
02:42
Apostolic Center and you know I I just I
02:47
always say this because it happens
02:48
almost every time we meet together you
02:50
just may be healed it happens in the
02:53
glory here all the time we have so many
02:55
angels here on assignment and I just I
02:58
just got a feeling some of New York and
03:00
just going to get healed you know a lot
03:02
of times it happens during worship
03:03
happens during the word and so we
03:07
definitely haven't opened heaven and
03:08
this is a place where miracles happen
03:10
so when you feel the presence of the
03:12
Lord we like to say it like this just
03:14
reach out reach out and touch him and
03:17
receive your miracle tonight all right
03:23
it's been excited we were living in
03:27
supernatural times and this has been a
03:29
supernatural week I'm sure every
03:31
here knows that Paul Kane went to be
03:34
with the Lord last Tuesday evening and
03:36
today was the afternoon when his body
03:39
was laid to rest in Santa Maria and just
03:43
different the signs and wonders
03:44
happening throughout the week and and so
03:47
I know that we're in the midst but we're
03:50
always in the midst of the supernatural
03:51
but it just seems like something special
03:53
and so we invited Kat a while ago and of
03:56
course nobody but God knew that Paul was
03:59
gonna go home and actually be buried on
04:01
the first day when she's speaking and I
04:03
know that it's not a coincidence I don't
04:05
know exactly what it means maybe she
04:07
does but I know stuff like that is not
04:10
just a coincidence so we're really
04:12
blessed and honored Kat to have you here
04:15
again and I'm sure how many of you have
04:17
never been in a live cat care meeting Oh
04:20
a lot of you good you're in for a treat
04:22
so why don't you can make your way up
04:25
Kat you need to come up around this way
04:26
and yeah you ready oh and while she's
04:32
coming up somebody dropped their glasses
04:34
so if that's you you probably can't see
04:36
but here they are when I put them up
04:42
here so Kat
04:43
um well brought those in you don't know
04:46
the Lord's been taking her to heaven for
04:48
several years and showing her things and
04:50
bringing her back and allowing her to
04:51
share with us so let's just welcome cat
04:54
Kirk
04:54
[Applause]
05:00
Wow
05:02
[Applause]
05:06
I know some people know why I'm saying
05:12
that some may not when the army of
05:16
heaven goes to battle against the
05:18
darkness that is their war cry why
05:25
because they're excited you're gonna
05:28
crush the enemy's plans over you right
05:30
they're gonna crush them they're gonna
05:33
pull down strongholds that have been
05:35
rising against you that's why they were
05:38
created news flash from heaven they
05:41
weren't created to protect heaven they
05:45
were made by the creator of heaven they
05:48
didn't get to kick Lucifer and one-third
05:51
of the angels out then you get to do
05:52
that
05:53
Michael hell them and the Father sent a
05:56
lightning bolt a million megawatts of
05:58
love from himself and took him out and
06:01
then one third of angels went out the
06:04
same way so they've been waiting a long
06:07
time to war on our behalf full time amen
06:13
I may or may not give you scripture for
06:16
that tonight go look it up I think most
06:20
of us know that Jesus was the lord of
06:24
state loud the host is the name of the
06:30
army of heaven yes they're still part of
06:32
the angel tribes but they're different
06:35
in many ways the ones under Gabriel have
06:40
many different positions and jobs in
06:43
heaven and on the earth and they look
06:46
more like us
06:47
they're the ones who look more like us
06:48
the army of heaven mostly does not look
06:51
anything like us they're creatures most
06:53
of them are creatures they're fierce
06:55
looking they're not gonna be pretty boys
06:57
with harps so what the Holy Spirit says
07:02
they're not gonna be pretty boys with
07:04
harps however there was one time when
07:08
they had to take the place of the
07:10
worship angels which were the one-third
07:12
that were kicked out the only ones
07:15
Lucifer got were the ones he was over he
07:17
was over one-third of the angels
07:18
was the worship angels obviously if he
07:22
was the one who led them in worship all
07:24
the time in heaven I'm just gonna give
07:27
you full out Revelation because I want
07:29
to take advantage of all the time I have
07:31
so if you didn't know this he used to
07:33
step inside God to lead worship he
07:36
covered over the very heart of God with
07:38
his wings which were embellished with
07:40
gems he had gems on his back on his
07:43
front people go well he had just a few
07:45
no he had really hundreds of them on him
07:48
and when God made him he made mountings
07:51
like in a ring and every gem was mounted
07:54
and amounting like a ring that you would
07:56
wear like this one here and he was
07:58
beautiful which is one of the reasons
08:00
why he ended up by falling from pride
08:02
from his beauty also he thought he was
08:05
smarter than God and that was a that was
08:08
busted mythbuster it's okay to laugh cuz
08:18
you're gonna laugh a lot tonight
08:19
alright heaven laughs every time the
08:23
devil loses down here all of heaven
08:25
roars yes they know what's going on and
08:29
today they were attendants for Paul Cain
08:33
with Paul Cain not talking about the
08:37
body talk about his spirit man everyone
08:42
gets to see their own homecoming isn't
08:44
that nice
08:45
so we're colors and play lots of music
08:48
and dance because that's what they'll be
08:51
doing in heaven news flash from heaven
08:54
number two they don't have a funeral in
08:56
heaven when you come home say Amen you
09:01
shouldn't expect one we should have a
09:04
party zone down here when we send people
09:07
off instead of a funeral home someone
09:09
opened a party zone I promise you'll
09:11
make more money than other people with
09:12
funeral homes cuz even the world will
09:14
want to send theirs off wherever they
09:15
think they're going they'll pick a party
09:19
anybody say Amen so that is a witty idea
09:24
I've been giving up for years I don't
09:25
think anybody's done it yet so there you
09:27
go the more real heaven becomes to the
09:32
body of
09:33
people will want to send them off with a
09:35
real celebration because of the reality
09:40
of what heaven is and what they're going
09:41
to be experiencing there it won't make
09:43
sense to have a sad funeral while
09:47
they're watching from the party I'm a
09:51
seer that means I see in the unseen
09:57
realm okay mister
10:01
I'm really happy Danny because I got to
10:04
experience all that heaven was doing and
10:06
what was going on with Paul Kane and his
10:09
mother and his sisters you know his
10:11
family that's up there and the others
10:14
who were attending up there watching his
10:16
service he enjoyed every funny thing
10:19
that was told he likes to be real so he
10:22
liked all the reality of who he was he
10:24
liked that personal side of him being
10:27
talked about so next time you plan a
10:30
family members homegoing service tell
10:33
some jokes because they will laugh I was
10:39
at a service one time and back home and
10:42
it was um trying to member the guys name
10:45
I remember told McClellan he was part of
10:47
story side B and he died suddenly and I
10:52
came into his service I didn't know
10:54
anyone but I was coming to bring some
10:56
books about heaven to his family the
10:57
Holy Spirit told me to and I saw him
11:00
watching from the portal that was really
11:03
difficult you know to try to pretend to
11:06
be sad and I never wear black it's okay
11:12
if you if you go to somewhere where
11:13
they're expecting you know to do what is
11:15
proper not to upset them but no one's
11:19
wearing black in heaven they're not and
11:22
they aren't having to partying there was
11:25
I saw Ron McClellan thank you my best
11:27
friend Holy Spirit he makes up for what
11:30
I don't know you know helps my human
11:34
head lots of times
11:35
because they kind of took that away from
11:37
me I used to be kind of brilliant
11:40
really then they made me like eight
11:42
years old
11:43
life is much easier being that way you
11:46
know what you don't worry about things
11:48
you don't think about what's gonna
11:49
happen five years down the road when you
11:51
don't even know or you already planned
11:54
you know prepare for disasters or
11:55
something I never got that really if
11:58
we're over the weather then we shouldn't
11:59
be concerned about the weather we rule
12:02
over it amen
12:03
okay she didn't know news bulletins
12:06
number three writes number three are you
12:07
keeping track you're gonna get a gift
12:11
number three
12:13
Jesus was over the weather we are joint
12:18
ears we get to be over the weather and
12:20
that great you're gonna see that more
12:23
and more I'm serious you're gonna see it
12:25
more and more things stop like stop
12:27
can't wait for that to happen
12:30
meteorologists might have to get another
12:32
job not making fake news by the way
12:37
they don't work now and it's not gonna
12:39
work when it's not actually happening
12:41
what was I talking about
12:46
number three boys over over the weather
12:52
Jesus was over the weather and he tried
12:54
so hard to teach his disciples he really
12:56
was in case you didn't know they were in
12:58
boot camp with him for three years it
13:01
wasn't just watch what I do
13:03
it's learn what I do and then do it
13:06
right he was gonna go he's gonna go back
13:09
for some R&R and he had to make sure
13:13
they understood how this whole thing
13:14
works being a joint heir with Christ
13:17
what do you have we have he said so
13:19
himself the things I did how point-blank
13:22
can you get the things and the works I
13:25
have done you will do well you forgot
13:30
the first part you will do also okay
13:34
these are just the works you got to do
13:36
the works say we got to do the works
13:40
then we get to do the greater say it
13:44
louder okay like you're excited well I
13:50
don't just try things I actually do them
13:54
there's a difference I'm just gonna try
13:57
that means you're not making much of a
13:59
plan about that right but doing it the
14:05
works I did you will do they do also and
14:11
greater works you will do I think that
14:18
means we're socially doing something
14:22
we're entering into a busy season a busy
14:26
season operating in the supernatural not
14:29
just talking about it a busy season
14:32
handling the wealth of the wicked not
14:34
just talking about it a busy season
14:38
living not just existing doing the more
14:43
say the more the more is amazing are you
14:49
getting better I am just as passionate
14:56
about living holy as I am about being
15:00
funny and I will tell you I I have to I
15:04
have to give you both sides of heaven
15:07
there's two sides in heaven there's holy
15:10
profound the other whole half of heaven
15:13
is funny say funny everybody have
15:19
they've thought for ever and for ages
15:22
that it would be boring in heaven maybe
15:24
because all they do is worship let me
15:27
tell you you stand in front of him it's
15:28
not boring
15:30
whether you're staring feeling like
15:33
you're going to faint melting to the
15:34
ground you know you feel like you don't
15:37
have breath in you because of just being
15:39
near him yeah it is an honor a privilege
15:42
and amazing when you worship and it's
15:44
not normal not even worship as normal in
15:48
heaven you ride on it you create things
15:53
as you're worshiping him you're creating
15:56
when you worship given the devil a big
16:00
black eye and a very bad day when you
16:04
worship Him you are shredding bashing
16:07
and crushing his fake little wannabe
16:09
Kingdom
16:10
in the second heaven when you worship
16:12
Him it's amazing from doing one thing
16:17
for him to honor him to bless him to
16:21
adore him
16:22
what destruction you do against the
16:24
kingdom of darkness that's my favorite
16:27
second thing I don't do demons I do do
16:34
Jesus though I love him I honor him I
16:38
can't do anything without him it's
16:40
because of him and with him and it is
16:43
his plan even the pink hair is his plan
16:47
because he's not boring there's nothing
16:51
boring about him there's absolutely
16:53
nothing boring about heaven there's
16:55
nothing boring about our future
16:58
that's like in the next few days the
17:03
more you believe things are real the
17:06
more real they will become and that is
17:10
actually a spiritual truth it's a spirit
17:13
realm truth the more you believe it is
17:15
real and talk about it being real and
17:18
write about it being real and actually
17:20
acting in it being real the more real
17:23
it's going to become to you it's the
17:26
original realm it's the eternal realm
17:29
it's not the temporary realm this is a
17:32
temporary life for you
17:33
it's a temporary place to live a
17:36
temporary to do things because this
17:38
earth is not eternal I know people have
17:41
worked it out in their own mind with
17:43
their head research and they're looking
17:45
up stuff and sometimes assuming because
17:49
I've read a lot of translations and
17:51
someone kind of miss it I know because
17:54
the Holy Spirit shows me those
17:55
scriptures then he'll show me 30
17:58
scriptures of it being translated I take
18:04
the word for the value it gives it's
18:07
real it is for us to repair us to
18:12
accelerate us to propel us into high
18:15
places you never dreamed of doing things
18:18
you never dreamed of we are living
18:21
examples of the
18:23
Father Son and Holy Spirit on this earth
18:26
that's why you're here you here to be
18:29
like them look like them and act like
18:32
them I don't see any failure in any of
18:36
that I don't see hopelessness
18:38
worthlessness I don't see fear at all
18:43
one of the first things the Holy Spirit
18:45
gives me these Kingdom quotes it's what
18:47
we decided to call him there's so many
18:49
we don't know what to call and we didn't
18:50
just say a quote the Holy Spirit is a
18:52
Kingdom quote was don't let fear
18:55
interfere that was a good one right
19:00
teach me never to fear never say never
19:03
at all in any way fear does not control
19:09
our life we do not partner with fear he
19:12
didn't put fear in us when he made us
19:16
we're supposed to be fearless and
19:21
timeless everybody should be yelling I
19:24
receive it say timeless we're supposed
19:31
to be timeless he said you had to die
19:38
I'm being serious not funny now serious
19:42
John didn't have to die did he say no
19:52
didn't Jesus say to the disciples what
19:55
is it so in other words he's saying it
19:56
doesn't matter what they think
19:58
you probably actually said that he's a
20:01
character he's the son of God but he is
20:04
a character the problem with the biggest
20:06
characters in heaven except for Holy
20:07
Spirit Holy Spirit has gotten beat by by
20:09
that much who they called the drama King
20:14
Jesus is the king of kings Holy Spirit
20:19
is a drama King you haven't only seen
20:22
just a little bit of his activity so far
20:24
waiting to the full fledge release on
20:27
this earth
20:30
he's excited he's excited about what's
20:34
about to happen in us they've been
20:37
waiting a long time say they've been
20:38
waiting a long time if I say the word
20:42
day I mean the Trinity they're not
20:46
boring
20:47
none of them they know how to step
20:50
inside of each other and be one one
20:52
thing that's how it happens I know I was
20:56
eight years old father caught me up
20:59
before the throne and said I'm going to
21:00
show you how the three can be one and a
21:03
five-year-old can understand that man's
21:05
head knowledge has expanded it and
21:08
expanded it and all kind of could use
21:10
every other kind of word explaining that
21:12
you know multiply it whatever you want
21:13
to call it made it look amazing powerful
21:15
and hard to understand it's simple they
21:21
can step inside of each other Jesus said
21:24
father I pray that one day that they be
21:27
one even as we are one because he steps
21:31
inside his father all the time when he
21:35
was the word he did the same thing I
21:37
didn't forget I was only on number three
21:40
bulletins by the way I've got some more
21:41
I was the least likely person to anyone
21:49
on this earth would have chosen to do
21:50
this okay I'm from a tribe like a real
21:54
one 15 people in an alligator and an
21:59
iguana innumerable amount of toad frogs
22:02
and lizards and spiders we grew up with
22:06
them in our home I had seven brothers
22:10
what did you think in Florida
22:12
you add that up that's what that comes
22:14
to sell your bike to some kid for a pig
22:17
bring him home wrap him up and close and
22:19
you have a new pet overnight we never
22:23
knew what was going to be in our home so
22:26
I didn't need anyone's opinions I was
22:29
never part of a group or a clique I had
22:30
a tribe God did that to kill me I'm a
22:35
dead person standing before you dead
22:39
people are wonderful for God to use
22:42
they're not full of self they don't have
22:46
their own opinion and the devil cannot
22:49
use a dead person the more dead you are
22:54
to yourself the more dangerous you are
22:57
against hell there are many ways to kill
23:02
me
23:03
before I even grew up and you know it
23:06
doesn't matter I mean I love everyone in
23:08
this room I loved all my siblings I
23:10
survived I conquered I was a leader
23:13
wasn't liked all the time but I was a
23:18
big help to my parents I honor my
23:20
parents greatly every day of my life I
23:22
loved them I didn't want to hurt them
23:26
they needed help say parents they need
23:31
help pastors they need more help
23:39
I'm grateful people can start a church
23:41
Oh No I've already died I don't need a
23:45
church I don't need a whole
23:47
congregations of people although I love
23:50
them I bless you all but I really bless
23:53
the pastor because they die every day to
23:58
be that amen
24:00
you'll notice that God didn't actually
24:04
send his son to be a pastor did you ever
24:07
notice that they actually sent him as a
24:10
businessman
24:11
God loves business people they're easy
24:14
they know how to listen they know how to
24:17
complete things that are given to them
24:19
they don't leave things out forget
24:20
things ignore things they do a job amen
24:24
so he sent his son as a businessman who
24:26
could easily connect with the sinners
24:30
and he did they ate with him all the
24:34
time they liked him he was exciting he
24:38
was interesting he was funny his
24:42
favorite job was to offend the hierarchy
24:47
he was good at it
24:50
and yet lived holy did miracles raise
24:54
the dead they took money from people for
24:57
spotted lambs they weren't high on God's
25:01
list and he had to train his disciples I
25:12
know he only had him for three years and
25:15
I think most of them finally got it
25:17
after he left but they did give him
25:21
credit they did but in the beginning I'm
25:25
sure Jesus would go to the Father when
25:27
he went to the mountain all the time and
25:28
say are you sure I have to that fight
25:33
all the time
25:34
they brawl over women I have one who
25:38
wants to be everything until everybody
25:40
that that would be Peter I have a
25:43
treasure you know that cheats all the
25:45
time right you know that you know he
25:48
takes money all the time I know you know
25:50
that too
25:51
and I have a tax collector and every
25:53
time you walk down the road to go
25:55
Minister we get stones thrown at us
25:56
because they don't like him I don't know
25:59
anybody who likes tax clusters they
26:01
didn't back then either so he did not
26:05
give him the best or the easiest to
26:08
Train and I know I was saying something
26:12
to God about my some of my staff and he
26:16
said I didn't make it easy for my son in
26:18
my conversation ended with that subject
26:22
especially when he caught me up me took
26:24
me back and I got to walk through a
26:26
whole day of their lives
26:28
like in their first year of being
26:30
together all right God I can make it God
26:38
has a plan for you every single person
26:41
is important to him and I do know this
26:44
your birth was timed on this earth God
26:50
created time he knew you before you were
26:53
born because you played inside of him he
26:56
saw you if there was time he saw you all
27:00
the time how great is
27:03
see that he was huge he could make
27:05
himself as big as he wanted to and he
27:07
walked on the mountains he was out where
27:10
there was nothing and he spoke and the
27:12
world would step out of him and make
27:13
space that God would make himself small
27:21
enough to step inside himself and play
27:23
with you he did say he's not a man he's
27:32
God and even being that great he knew
27:36
everything about you knew the mistakes
27:40
knew our faults knew everything that had
27:43
great hope and great plans for you to do
27:47
great things so it's no mistake you're
27:49
here now in this age instead of the ages
27:53
before this time you're here right on
27:55
time for the accelerator time for the
27:59
more of God for the kingdom age for the
28:05
time to command the hosts of heaven
28:07
handle the wealth by host cities for him
28:12
to use because he's not poor he knows
28:18
the names of your children that you'll
28:20
have even before you get married he
28:22
knows them and he put them in your
28:25
family line on purpose in this
28:29
generation that's here now this is a
28:31
special generation for God it's the
28:34
beginning of the group and type of
28:36
people that will remain until all things
28:39
be fulfilled some well the Bible says
28:47
there'll be a group of people like that
28:48
a group and type of people a generation
28:51
that we're generation means a group and
28:54
type of people it doesn't mean like 30
28:56
years or actually that word in the Bible
28:59
that says Jesus says that there'll be a
29:03
group and Type O people on earth that
29:04
will be here when all things be
29:05
fulfilled including the coming of him
29:08
that word means a group and type of
29:11
people that work generation means that
29:14
there will be a grouping type of people
29:16
on this earth that also says in the
29:18
Bible that would taste of the powers say
29:21
powers of the age to come that would be
29:29
the Millennial age of course there's
29:32
people now let's say they're not going
29:33
to be in millennium I go about what the
29:37
Bible says there will be a millennium
29:40
there will be a Tribulation God caused a
29:43
bump in the road it will happen that's
29:48
on his timeline in heaven so no matter
29:53
what other people have come come up with
29:55
or assume or have putting in
29:56
translations I promise you it's going to
29:59
happen and you can't make it happen or
30:01
not happen anyway so to me it's not
30:02
worth agreeing over God's gonna work out
30:06
his plan all the way to the end right
30:09
I'm excited to know that I'm part of
30:12
that generation that will tasted the
30:14
powers of the age to come
30:16
that's why you need revelation because
30:21
that that all that comes from the heart
30:24
of God he already knows what it's going
30:27
to look like she knows what's gonna
30:28
happen
30:29
so he chose you to be here to be a part
30:32
say Amen that word means so be yet might
30:39
as well say it gonna happen there's no
30:43
one on the earth in the earth around the
30:47
earth say it's round I gotta say that
30:50
the Holy Spirit won't let it go okay so
30:54
that's him say the earth is round not
30:59
flat they don't have edges you may say
31:03
that property does not have edges there
31:05
you go
31:06
Holy Spirit truck can we use proper
31:08
grammar Ben m8 that's how they say it
31:14
there is a whole group of people that
31:16
sincerely spend so much time and money
31:20
to try to prove the earth is flat I'd
31:23
rather use that money in that time and
31:24
energy ruling
31:26
right I've flown many times and I didn't
31:31
get halfway around the world then all of
31:32
a sudden here's the flat earth and I'm
31:35
flying it didn't all of a sudden go wait
31:36
shh now you're on the other side no I
31:40
went around besides I've already been up
31:44
over the earth it's round
31:48
God made it round he says he sits on the
31:52
circle of the earth not the square you'd
31:58
be surprised how serious they are they
32:02
think NASA has spent billions of dollars
32:04
faking it and none of that stuff is real
32:08
I don't know who got that thought but it
32:11
didn't come from heaven a man so just
32:17
rest assured that it's around okay been
32:21
there seen that it is round and when I
32:24
almost shown it God caught me up in
32:25
space up and do like like first space
32:28
not I've been way up there but the first
32:30
time he caught me up and showed me the
32:32
earth he put a grid you know like a grid
32:35
you know what that is yeah a grid was
32:38
round and he put it right on the earth
32:40
cheol-ho together and then they begin to
32:42
draw things on this grid that was his
32:45
plan that was called space planning that
32:47
was also the Holy Spirit's joke he's out
32:50
in space put the grid than planned right
32:53
uses every opportunity to be funny so he
32:58
did show me his space planning for like
33:01
the next hundred years that was probably
33:06
15 20 years ago when he showed me that
33:09
that doesn't mean the earth is going to
33:12
end in a hundred years
33:13
except been taken further than that and
33:16
no tribulation had happened I know some
33:20
people think it's supposed to be right
33:21
now well if it was it would be people
33:26
get to heaven they all find out man we
33:29
wasted so much time sitting on our
33:30
rapture rug
33:36
she to roll it up put it in the closet
33:43
well you've you've been around a long
33:45
time you realize I went to church
33:48
everyday it was open and every day
33:51
someone said Jesus could come tomorrow
33:54
and in my I'm like little this is like
33:57
little I had these thoughts why would he
34:00
have all these plans in the Bible and go
34:02
okay not forget that we're just all
34:03
going home I mean he gave my dad a long
34:08
plan I mean my dad knew him he gave him
34:11
a long plan I mean he's not going to
34:12
where we haven't done what God told us
34:14
to do yet
34:15
and God said well many people are in
34:18
fear and they know one day that will
34:21
happen so they want it to come so to
34:24
them that's logical they don't
34:25
understand a lot especially in the book
34:27
of Revelation say revelations means
34:31
revelations that means something you
34:35
don't know so God said I'm calling you a
34:39
Revelator me you know why he did that so
34:41
people couldn't call me a false prophet
34:43
they don't know what a Revelator is so
34:45
they didn't never say nothing against it
34:50
they couldn't say well she's not a
34:54
terrible pastor no he can't call an
34:57
evangelist she doesn't go out and win
34:58
lots of millions we can't call her that
34:59
huh can't call her prophet she's a
35:03
Revelator don't know what that is so
35:04
we'll ignore all of that a Revelator is
35:10
someone who reveals like John did caught
35:14
up showing the future the future no know
35:17
what that was that was a bling glitch
35:19
write that down and don't forget it I
35:21
know Jen is writing it down right now if
35:25
I say word she goes you did a bling
35:26
glitch that means you blended some words
35:28
together okay I won't explain it yes
35:35
you've been there I'm sure people been
35:37
there right you've been there well at
35:40
least I'm not talking about noses
35:42
putting the animals on the art tonight
35:44
that's Moses and Noah doing it together
35:50
when Donna even said Adam did it I did
35:55
hear from people I have a bloopers thing
36:00
one day and just put them all on there
36:01
go there and look at it but now I forget
36:07
we're talking about who is listening
36:12
Revelator you're right so see I hear
36:22
them all the time I have to fight when
36:25
you're eight you need help so he didn't
36:31
pick me to be a professor you know I was
36:34
graduated middle of my class like
36:37
literally middle we had six hundred
36:40
graduating students we have a lot of
36:43
people coming to Florida to go to school
36:45
I guess they like it we're pretty
36:47
laid-back there you know and so it's a
36:51
nice place to live if you want to come
36:52
live someplace different go good
36:55
vacation time try not to come in August
37:00
really hot so being a Revelator's a
37:07
little bit different that usually
37:09
doesn't mean profit just so you've
37:10
wondered you know John was a men and
37:16
it's okay I love doing that but I love
37:20
being with my father my heavenly father
37:24
him all the time I know why Jesus loved
37:29
him so much I know why he wanted to be
37:31
with him I know why he went away to the
37:33
mountain to spend time with him I know
37:36
how hard it was for him to leave home
37:37
and come here okay he was not poor he
37:42
didn't live poor say Jesus was not poor
37:48
he became poor when he left heaven
37:52
because heaven is certainly not poor
37:56
there's nothing poor up there nothing
38:00
splendor and wandering beauty you
38:03
couldn't afford to build the house that
38:05
you're mentioned that your mother lives
38:07
in you wouldn't even have the right
38:10
substances to make it the walls sing
38:15
literally they sing they leave you go on
38:18
tours come back they sing hello to them
38:21
the trees uproot their self and they
38:23
come and sit in your house and be your
38:27
friend for a while they'll go back to
38:29
the friendly forest is this ok it's not
38:36
gonna be normal no you can't be normal
38:41
you've been going to heaven for 20 years
38:43
you be normal to heaven they tell funny
38:48
stories a lot Bob Jones hasn't stopped
38:57
most people when they go there no matter
38:59
how they were here they're all happy
39:01
they love jokes they love to tell funny
39:03
stories hear funny stories they love it
39:06
they make plans for people before they
39:08
come they knew Paul was coming they all
39:15
knew Paul is coming there's a place you
39:19
go in heaven where you find that out and
39:24
you go in this beautiful amazing
39:26
building and these supernatural monitors
39:29
much better than ours but these are good
39:32
and you can see who's coming home who's
39:35
about to come home to heaven everybody
39:37
starts getting things ready they're so
39:38
excited they're there beside their self
39:40
they want to make sure they're all there
39:42
say all to meet you at the gate they
39:48
have a huge celebration they plan one
39:51
themselves heaven plans one the throne
39:53
room plans one people have celebrations
39:56
in the street over someone coming home
39:59
stay home it's because that's where you
40:03
came from we were alone to the earth for
40:07
a while when you go home
40:09
you are really home and you're not dead
40:13
they don't throw parties for people who
40:16
aren't alive they have huge celebrations
40:21
lots of music lots of food everyone
40:25
meeting one another
40:26
visiting Jesus welcomes you if he isn't
40:31
taking you himself sometimes he does
40:34
take people he comes into his own
40:35
chariot flaming horses picks you up and
40:38
takes you up to heaven then when you get
40:42
out you see the sea or the mass of
40:44
people waiting to greet you and then
40:49
Jesus walks you up the steps of the
40:51
throne to give you back to the Father
40:54
and then the father reaches out of that
40:58
glory that moves in and out of him the
41:01
Living colors of the bow coming in and
41:04
out his eyes flames of fire passion for
41:07
you just glowing and he reaches his arms
41:11
out and grabs you he says welcome home
41:14

41:17

41:20
offspring every morning gets their own
41:24

41:27
your brother or sister I'll have my own
41:31

41:37
would love it but it's made with his
41:40
presence in the walls and the floors and
41:42
it's not gonna be a normal shape trust
41:45

41:59
members will all have gifts for you for
42:01
every year you've been apart they will
42:03
get a gift that represents that year and
42:05
put it in your mansion after your
42:08
welcome home party in the throne room
42:10
which could last for quite a while
42:13
your family will come get you and take
42:16
you to your own mansion then they'll
42:17
have another celebration
42:22
everybody laughs and filled with joy to
42:27
see all the ones they loved before
42:29
little tiny babies they never got to
42:31
raise they get their children given to
42:33
them to raise the same one that you that
42:37
didn't make it all the way through amen
42:41
God keeps them they live with your
42:44
grandparents or whoever when they get
42:46
there they'll go get them and help raise
42:48
them for a while I love the story of a
42:51
mother they lost their son he was either
42:55
7 or 8 he was hit by a car and they of
42:59
course they they grieved over him but
43:01
knew he was in heaven and I think it was
43:03
like 20 years later or 30 years later
43:05
one of the other huh
43:06
she died on the operating table and was
43:10
caught up to heaven saw her
43:12
seven-year-old son playing in the
43:15
streets of gold he goes mom Wow mom
43:18

43:20
your mom I'm so glad you're here and you
43:22
cuz what have you been doing goes I've
43:24
been playing with my friends what you
43:25

43:29
with his grandfather and playing with
43:31
all these friends and the streets to go
43:33
they were playing and he was laughing
43:35
and he said but you can't come yet
43:37
because it's not your time
43:38
and so she came back never forgot it and
43:43
her and her husband went around the
43:45
world talking about it you will be known
43:48
as you are known except you look better
43:53
like a whole lot better you'll have hair
44:01
most guys wear their hair about down to
44:04
their shoulders don't have you know
44:06
that's gonna change y'all I'm just
44:08
letting you know I can't change guys
44:10
unless you really want like a buzz cut
44:13
or something no Marine Corps or my
44:18
husband may still have one I would might
44:20
be surprised to see him alive yeah he's
44:25
still with me by the way another way to
44:26
kill me but that was okay
44:34
it's all worth everything it's worth it
44:40
all no matter what you surrender give up
44:44
miss doing it's worth it and you'll be
44:49
so happy when you stand before God and
44:52
you're welcomed home knowing that you
44:55
gave everything you could not saying you
44:58
have to walk around poor okay that was
45:00
the devil's plan not God's his plan is
45:04
to bless us say bless us and prosper us
45:10
it'll be worth it some people have
45:13
already seen Jesus here right how many
45:15
people have seen Jesus let me see either
45:18
in a vision or dream or in reality if
45:20
you've seen him how many people have
45:22
been encountered an angel there's
45:24
usually a lot there's a lot of people
45:26
here it's going to happen that's part of
45:28
the acceleration that's part of the more
45:31
it's a lot of them more actually that we
45:35
will see angels and they will probably
45:37
be talking to us they came from God
45:41
ignore what we've all been told our
45:42
whole lives don't talk to angels they
45:46
did in the Bible amen
45:49
there's gonna be a lot more of that
45:51
angelic not just visitation because what
45:55
we're going to experience is the
45:56
habitation heavens not coming for a
45:59
visit a heaven
46:01
is not coming for a visit they're coming
46:04
for a habitation you're part of the
46:09
habitation you are all of you sitting
46:11
here say I'm alive and breathing I'm
46:15
part of the habitation but God is about
46:22
to do on this earth does not just take a
46:25
territory here and there what the
46:28
habitation will be is in us say in us
46:34
that's the part of the habitation that's
46:36
why me and won't be able to control it
46:38
like they have in the past say God will
46:42
be in charge
46:45
it's a habitation and it will remain for
46:49
a long time he's gonna transform this
46:53
world right now he is shifting
46:55
government so he can shape Nations it's
47:04
part of the platform he's giving us in
47:06
the habitation
47:07
he's got platforms for us that's the
47:12
place that we will operate from and
47:14
speak from shake things cause things to
47:19
be released to change for him it's not a
47:26
lot of how it's always been in the past
47:28
that's why it's a new thing say a new
47:30
thing it's time for the new thing it's
47:37
where we will be ruling it's one of the
47:40
purposes that Christ died for us that's
47:43
why he went into hell and wasted it took
47:47
back the authority and Dominion the Adam
47:49
had given away he gave it to us he also
47:54
gave his power over all the power of the
47:57
enemy say we have power over all the
48:03
power of the enemy say he did not give
48:10
that to the Angels that's why we need to
48:16
command them they can't just go tear up
48:20
any demon they see they just can't do
48:23
that
48:23
they do it in in the past it was from
48:25
answers to prayer and prayers never
48:27
going to go away it's never gonna go
48:29
away
48:30
he loves prayer prayer is powerful it's
48:33
gonna get even more powerful especially
48:37
when you command part of an army of
48:38
heaven and they pull down strongholds
48:41
for you and crush the plains of darkness
48:46
we need this say we need it
48:49
to rule in this day say every King gets
48:55
the Kingdom and gets an army if we're
48:59
part of the kingdom we get part of the
49:03
army did you ever see a king a natural
49:08
King on this earth title rule with that
49:09
one they wouldn't go very far with a
49:13
they'd be overrun beaten up things
49:17
stolen things killed someone's like the
49:20
devil he comes to kill steal and destroy
49:30
that's what the army prevents heavens
49:35
army was designed created and made every
49:38
one of them unique and different but
49:42
they are fierce they have one job the
49:47
ones under Gabriel have many different
49:49
jobs many different positions to do many
49:52
different things but but Michael is over
49:56
one specific part and that is the army
50:00
they have a headquarters they have
50:02
barracks they have training fields
50:05
they're all in the sky of heaven Rand
50:08
maneuvers for ages in the past Jesus
50:12
would go send up Michael to gather the
50:15
army from the far ends of heaven to
50:18
fight on behalf of Israel people say
50:20
Amen
50:20
it's in the Bible go read it sometimes
50:25
they even fought the flesh did you know
50:27
that yeah some of them could fight the
50:30
flesh in this time on earth it's mostly
50:36
battles in the spirit battling the
50:39
demonic even those in the high places
50:42
the principalities and the powers the
50:46
things the beings in wickedness in high
50:48
places many of those high places will be
50:51
shredded and pulled down say our weapons
50:58
they are mighty to the pulling down of
51:03
strongholds that's one of the things the
51:07
army does I can only share what I have
51:13
been told and I can only tell you what I
51:16
have been shown shown and told that's
51:21
what I talk about but they didn't just
51:24
show me things and tell me things I had
51:26
to live it every way something mom is
51:29
trained in it was for the body of Christ
51:32
so I had to live it to let you know it's
51:36
real and it really does work she follow
51:39
heavens protocol see on earth as it is
51:44
in heaven
51:45
that's what we've been asking for for
51:49
generations we should have expected it
51:56
jesus bushwhacked us all he did he told
52:01
me is it I knew if I taught them that
52:03
and said you say that eventually it
52:06
would come you mean one thing I could
52:10
get them to agree on no matter what
52:14
denomination they rod to clear that
52:17
prayer because they need us to call
52:21
things in is that right you have not
52:27
because you ask not
52:31
if you've ever said to Jesus I'll give
52:34
you anything you want no matter what it
52:36
is where it is what time it is I give
52:39
you permission to use me as anyone ever
52:41
says something like that let me see your
52:44
hands
52:45
well I'll get ready because he's calling
52:51
in those words yes it's gonna be amazing
52:56
say amazing heaven is amazing it's gonna
53:01
be amazing here we can live on earth
53:04
like they live in heaven which is mainly
53:08
his will being done
53:11
his way say his way not our way that's
53:18
part of the more she's gonna do new
53:21
thing he goes revelation and then ways
53:25
for you to use that revelation it means
53:28
a lot of things are gonna change so if
53:31
you're stuck in your own mind or your
53:33
own mindset of what you think is gonna
53:35
happen and because it didn't it's not
53:37
going to you need to just so that away
53:40
because he does have a timeline in his
53:44
own throne room and those dots on that
53:47
timeline is when his things are going to
53:50
happen regardless of what anybody on the
53:54
earth is doing it's his sovereign will
53:57
and what right now this time we're in
54:00
it's on his timeline it is many of the
54:04
generals are going home doesn't mean
54:07
they'll be oblivious to what we're doing
54:10
that means they'll know all about it
54:12
after they get there and the thing
54:13
they'll be celebrating is us who are
54:15
still down here being a part of it so
54:21
God really needs us right now he's
54:34
intimidating me although I probably
54:36
would have never chosen except when he
54:40
asked me I said yes say it's important
54:44
to say yes to being chosen many are
54:50
called but few are chosen because they
54:55
don't choose that's why many aren't
54:59
chosen he can't make you do it right
55:04
you're called you're being called but he
55:07
can't make you do that you have to
55:09
choose yes and when you do that you're
55:11
saying yes I want to be chosen and then
55:14
you're chosen what does it take to be
55:15
chosen say choose yes
55:21
then you got to be willing he makes it a
55:23
little bit you know gotta be willing and
55:25
obedient say willing obedience next say
55:35
surrender is not control a lot of people
55:42
think it is because you know God does
55:45
have he does have I'm trying to think of
55:52
the natural earthward it's like not
55:54
there he does have guidelines is that
56:00
right even Jesus had them that he
56:03
operated by Jesus didn't just pick
56:06
things on his own all the time where did
56:10
he say I do yeah what his father said
56:17
right but he showed him and what he told
56:20
him that's what he did that's why we
56:24
need revelation otherwise we're gonna
56:27
get man's mind set on everything and
56:30
that hasn't worked well has it he's not
56:36
going to abandon the church I've heard
56:39
all kinds of things when people's gonna
56:40
abandon the church it's just gonna go
56:42
away burn down we don't need it anymore
56:45
let's get rid of it when he's not saying
56:47
that to me he's going to set it on fire
56:52
amen this is a time to be willing and
56:56
obedient if you want to eat the fat of
56:59
the land and Jesus did ask us to pray
57:03
about one other thing pray that my
57:05
people say we are his people be willing
57:11
and the day of his power well obviously
57:16
if he's going to give us revelation to
57:18
operate like he does and part of that is
57:22
power
57:22
he says he'll give you power over all
57:25
the part of the enemy there's one right
57:26
there
57:26
he's given us power and he does have
57:31
power
57:33
so if this is the day of his power the
57:36
biggest thing the most important thing
57:37
is remember the willing and obedient
57:38
thing what he asked probably won't seem
57:42
natural or normal to you wasn't natural
57:46
normal to ask me to have pink hair I
57:49
wasn't a pink haired person I liked it
57:53
he wouldn't have asked me it's better
57:57
than camel hair I like pink here any day
58:02
over camel hair it smells it's stiff not
58:09
comfortable and he had to wrap himself
58:11
in it okay my pink hair is a test it
58:18
divides asunder the Spirit from the
58:21
flesh so those who trash or bash it or
58:26
in the flash are we still so walking the
58:30
flash say no we're supposed to walk in
58:35
the so people don't have to tell me if
58:40
they're hearing their flesh or hearing
58:42
their spirit it's the way they react to
58:45
the pink care now people who like pink
58:48
hair they think is amazing so the world
58:49
must be passing their tests because they
58:53
all love it that's amazing you look
58:56
amazing what do you do I'm a
58:59
spokesperson for haven't I've been there
59:02
and then they all say the same thing
59:05
they don't say you're liar your father's
59:07
property was that they go what was it
59:09
like what was it like is it beautiful is
59:14
it amazing is it real is is God real is
59:16
there a god and go oh yes there is a God
59:20
and you lived inside of him before you
59:22
came here okay that makes him interested
59:26
not bashing amen
59:30
try that next time you did live in him
59:36
you moved in and out of him he was your
59:39
very existence you had your very
59:40
existence in him that's why he knew you
59:43
that's why he saw you before he sent you
59:46
here you're wonderfully and perfectly
59:51
made your souls were the most amazing
59:54
parts of you of all you change your very
59:57
life by what you feed it you change how
60:01
you feel about things by what you say
60:04
yourself if you don't like you then
60:08
change change what you're saying change
60:12
what you're watching change what you let
60:14
other people say around you because you
60:16
need to guard your heart what goes in
60:20
there is what you will become
60:22
amen if you've never heard that before
60:26
it's Revelation on your soul your soul
60:28
is what you are people say well I'm
60:32
missing that no Adam became a living
60:36
Saint loud he became a living soul
60:43
that's how important it is to God that's
60:45
why he gave you a soul you could choose
60:47
yourself you could choose with your will
60:50
you can think about things choose it and
60:52
then you do it and then your emotions
60:56
display who and what you believe with
61:00
your life it's probably one of the least
61:03
talked about things in the church it's a
61:06
soul growing up I always heard that it
61:09
was bad and went but God made it right
61:13
he it's one third of us is that right
61:16
we'll always have our soul
61:18
why would he make it bad it's a powerful
61:22
thing and it's a good thing because you
61:25
can feel yourself with God and then
61:26
you'll be like him you can talk about
61:29
him then you really believe he is real
61:32
you can feed your soul 24 hours a day
61:36
your body gets fed a few times a day
61:39
your spirit man gets fed once a week
61:43
most people go to church once a week but
61:48
your souls fed all the time by what you
61:52
watch what you say what people say to
61:54
you you can be crushed by tragedies and
61:57
you can't you can't forget it you hang
61:59
on to it somebody
62:00
you wound and hurt eunuch stays there
62:02
forever your soul has layers and it
62:06
collects things in those layers that's
62:09
why you have a memory but your layers
62:12
are supposed to be used for different
62:13
something different than that every
62:16
layer of you looks like you who wants
62:19
revelation on the soul let me see your
62:20
hand I was shown one and the father
62:26
spent four hours with me earth time I
62:28
never usually know but I looked at my
62:30
clock and I was talking to him then he
62:32
just catches me up and begins to show me
62:35
a human soul what it look like how he
62:37
made it why did he make it that way how
62:39
people can cause her soul to prosper all
62:41
the time and then they live in divine
62:43
health there was a requirement about
62:47
that prospering it says even as your
62:51
soul prospers you will prosper and you
62:55
will be in health that where B means lib
62:59
it's called divine health so I since I
63:05
learned about the father taught me about
63:07
that he said people can loose with the
63:09
keys of the kingdom you can loose things
63:10
out of your soul when you loose it it's
63:13
gone
63:14
and that doesn't matter what it is he
63:17
started giving me this very long list of
63:19
things that you can loose from your soul
63:21
and he said I know most people buying
63:24
the devil but the keys to the kingdom
63:26
but they mostly never talked about the
63:29
loosing thing what are gonna do with the
63:30
loosing key and yet the binding key is
63:34
more important to bind the things of God
63:37
to your soul because then they can't be
63:38
taken away what you choose to bind to
63:43
your soul about God will never be taken
63:46
from you and so people I know you know
63:51
if you still want to bind the devil go
63:52
ahead and do it I'd rather loose the
63:56
stuff out of my soul that he tried
63:57
putting there you know if you have an
64:00
anger issue in your anger anger angry
64:02
all the time you don't even know you're
64:03
just angry it's all it comes out of you
64:05
it's in your soul you choose with your
64:08
will to loose that's that anger then
64:12

65:15
amen tomorrow night we're gonna have
65:19
some fire sent the Angels already
65:22
outside waiting but they're gonna do
65:24
that tomorrow night I did this recently
65:27
where I mean people were literally
65:28
flaming like they were flaming because
65:34
this is time just darkening I want to
65:37
say drops of it the fire of God is
65:41
amazing it comes from himself inside him
65:45
say our God is a consuming fire I'm
65:49
about to get consumed it's one of the
65:54
most asked asked things by the body of
65:56
Christ send the fire I want the fire
66:01
give me the fire let me be consumed let
66:03
me burn for you it burns everything off
66:07
the walls of your heart I mean literally
66:09
make sure your heart white you are
66:15
filled with boldness like you've never
66:16
had before in your life you're fearless
66:20
you're bold you you got filled with God
66:23
the fire it burns it out then he puts
66:28
him in
66:28
selves in there he heaps more stones of
66:31
fire inside of you those came from God
66:35
two stones a fire I find a one
66:39
translation said that they were they
66:41
were flaming stones that Satan left on
66:43
some other planet that was in a Bible
66:48
and I already knew what they were so God
66:51
made me look up like 29 different
66:53
translations to go see what they say it
66:54
is like they missed that one no they
66:59
didn't ever belong to Lucifer okay they
67:03
were inside God or he burns with this
67:07
fire for you under the water they burn
67:11
in the River of Life that's in him the
67:14
river flows out of him the gemstones
67:17
flow out of him even the steps of the
67:19
throne room have gemstones they flow out
67:22
of heaven and become the crystal see is
67:24
called the crystal see because there's
67:26
gemstones in it not sand
67:30
that's why it's cut crystal faceted
67:33
gemstones they're all over heaven they
67:36
all come from one place when the father
67:38
and the firewood burn inside of him and
67:41
Lucifer would step in and there's his
67:43
holy mountain inside God say God is not
67:47
a man he doesn't look the same inside
67:52
that we do but we lived there that's why
67:57
we like sparkly things way back in our
68:01
way back in our spirit man we remember
68:06
that we met we remember that there's
68:09
something that connects when we look at
68:11
something that's brilliant and beautiful
68:13
gemstones represent the love of God his
68:17
love his revelation upon this rock I
68:21
know he said Peter was a rock when God
68:24
says rock in the Bible he's talking
68:25
about a gemstone you know that white
68:29
rock that white rock rock or stone
68:31
you're gonna get when you go home to
68:32
heaven and there's a name under the only
68:34
he and you know it's a white diamond
68:37
it's not a River Rock
68:40
every syllabus I ever saw showed a river
68:43
rock when it talked about that that
68:46
stone so inside his eternity you never
68:52
see at the end there's no end inside of
68:56
him no end and we ran up and down this
69:00
mountain and we slid down the river of
69:02
life and would jump on the stones of
69:04
fire through the flames we lived in
69:07
those flames you're about to get
69:10
baptized with him it's amazing I don't
69:16
even know what time it is I better check
69:17
what time is it oh my my see gem she's
69:31
at it you didn't finish talking about
69:35
Ron McClellan remember I was at his
69:41
service right and I can I come in with
69:44
these books in his parents and
69:46
grandparents are sitting on the front
69:47
row I didn't know him so but I knew a
69:49
couple people there at celebration
69:51
Church they let me come in and I just
69:53
was going to wait till everything was
69:55
over and they were everybody with their
69:57
line going by the casket and he had this
70:01
bright yellow suit on I mean bright with
70:05
his big white tie and and he had the
70:07
biggest fro I've ever seen on a human
70:09
they had to stick it down in the casket
70:12
and as I was walking I was walking up I
70:17
looked up I was trying not to laugh out
70:21
loud because it was an open portal and
70:24
he was watching his service and now this
70:27
is a band right band in a van travelling
70:32
telling jokes non-stop doing sock
70:35
puppets you know crazy stuff he did
70:37
crazy things in the van with the guys
70:39
and his band was there and they were
70:42
telling the funniest stories and every
70:44
time they say something funny he would
70:45
go like this is here we go
70:53
so here I'm looking at the casket and
70:56
then I look up there
71:00
he was alive for now and there was a lot
71:02
of funny stories right so I'm like this
71:04
is just this crazy it was so much fun
71:06
and so I went back sat down and then it
71:10
came up when I gave out the books and I
71:13
didn't know who his parents were I knew
71:15
who his wife was and her mom dad were
71:17
there and I gave them one and I didn't
71:21
know that was his father sitting there
71:22
so I was telling you know his wife this
71:24
is a book about heaven I really think it
71:26
a bless you and I started to turn away
71:28
and and the Holy Spirit to tell me take
71:30
an extra one so of course willing and
71:32
obedient I had an extra one in a little
71:35
bag wondering who was gonna give it to
71:36
and he grabbed my arm II said did you
71:38
say that book was about heaven
71:40
I said yes I I've been there he says can
71:42
I have that book and I said yes yes you
71:45
can have and he goes well I'm Randstad
71:48
well was then this was for you because I
71:51
didn't know you were gonna be here but
71:53
he told me to bring it so this is your
71:55
book and a few months later I get a
71:57
phone call it's always in the middle of
71:59
night and it's his parents and they're
72:02
undone they were so full of joy in
72:04
celebration after reading about what
72:07
heaven was like they already knew what
72:09
their son would be doing having a band
72:10
and he does have a man and it's called
72:12
the other side of the story his heaven
72:17
he went from story side be to the other
72:20
side of the story that was his bayum but
72:23
in the band
72:24
angels were playing and singing with him
72:27
because he said he wouldn't let anyone
72:29
take the place of his band when they
72:31
came to heaven which I told their band
72:34
and so his parents called they were
72:37
really excited about everything and and
72:39
then I they gave me their daughter's
72:42
phone number he and his sister were
72:43
really close together and so I called
72:46
and just spoke to her for a few minutes
72:48
and and then about I don't know it was
72:50
probably a year later she called me she
72:51
goes today is my birthday my 30th
72:55
birthday and I just wanted to know does
72:57
my brother even remember me does he
73:00
still think about me because we had
73:02
planned a big celebration on this day
73:04
we didn't know he'd go home so I while
73:08
she's on the phone to me God caught me
73:09
up to heaven and I saw her brother
73:13
standing at a portal
73:15
this goes sound wild but it didn't
73:17
matter he was throwing Cheetos at her
73:19
from the portal and he was singing the
73:24
worst rendition of happy birthday I've
73:27
ever heard and this is a guy who sings
73:28
sent was singing for a living right
73:30
like me and this that's awful that's
73:33
awful
73:33
and then God sends me back and I'm she's
73:38
still going on the phone I said wait a
73:39
minute wait wait wait wait wait I got to
73:40
you hey I don't know what you can think
73:42
about this but I got to tell you what
73:43
what I just saw in heaven I saw your
73:46
brother and he was throwing Cheetos over
73:49
the portal at you and she starts to yell
73:52
and scream she goes that that's she said
73:57
he even had a throw by he run by what do
74:02
you want a Cheeto throwing whatever he
74:04
had her fro to so he said his greatest
74:07
thing to do was run through the room and
74:10
throw as many Cheetos in her fro that
74:12
would stick there and she said he did it
74:16
all the time and I was so irritated but
74:17
now it's the most precious thing in the
74:19
world that you told me that because I
74:21
know he didn't forget me this is on her
74:23
birthday remember and I said oh I don't
74:25
know how to tell you this but he he
74:26
sounded the worst I have ever heard
74:29
for someone who's anointed to sing she
74:31
said was it the worst happy birthday you
74:33
ever heard in your life I want ya she
74:35
said he did that every year too so she
74:39
was so blessed to find out she that he
74:43
had not changed he still remembered her
74:46
he was still himself and she was so
74:50
blessed by that so now if Jen there Jen
74:53
I finished the story I'm done with okay
74:56
so I want to encourage you to understand
75:00
that your family still loves you no one
75:04
has forgotten you
75:06
they're making plans for you in this
75:10
little vapor of time that we're in right
75:12
now on this earth use it powerfully
75:17
to love to forgive and to be willing and
75:22
obedient understand John
75:26
his last message loved one another that
75:31
should be the thing we do the most amen
75:33
don't forget to love if you get a choice
75:36
forgive people who are bashing you when
75:39
you do that it really does wound the
75:41
demons and it is our time to torment the
75:44
Nieman's say it's our honor and
75:49
privilege to torment the demons those
75:57
demons ask Jesus have you come to
75:58
torment just before our time that meant
76:01
that was going to be a time when they
76:02
would be tormented is that right but he
76:07
didn't do that he gave us power right so
76:12
stand up for a minute I'm sure that Paul
76:20
is still enjoying his celebration party
76:23
it goes on for quite a while I know that
76:27
has something spent planned for him for
76:30
anyone who ever wanders he made it no
76:36
matter what you thought about his life
76:38
or consider for him he loved God he had
76:44
Christ in his heart he made mistakes he
76:47
repented for them amen and he's highly
76:52
honored and recognized in heaven for
76:54
what he did for God and they're happy to
76:58
have him home and so is his mom amen so
77:03
let's make a declaration I love to make
77:05
declarations say father thank you for
77:11
timing my birth on the earth for right
77:17

79:46
minutes I'd rather do that amen so I'm
79:55
guest tonight because tomorrow night I'm
79:58
probably getting the lightning power God
80:00
last time I did it John G showed up
80:05

80:11
came and stood right next to me
80:12
other seers saw him it was really zap
80:16
BAM time but tonight I really want to
80:21
give out a measure of the fire amen I've
80:24
had a measure of baptism and fire and
80:26
let me tell you I've not ever been the
80:28
same so I want you to take it home with
80:31
you let it burn on the inside of you
80:34
don't let the fire go out what you're
80:38
really doing is preparing a place for
80:39
more to come say more say when I receive
80:44
some of something from God I can have
80:49
more
81:03
I know there's major things that are
81:05
about to happen in your lives shifts
81:08
because this is the time to shift
81:10
there's a lot of shifts the other thing
81:13
is suddenly those are two different
81:17
things a suddenly comes when you least
81:21
expect it but just one suddenly can
81:25
change your life it will fill you so
81:28
full of faith when God moves his hand
81:31
for you it's always a good thing
81:33
say suddenly are good things because God
81:39
is preparing you to receive more of him
81:42
amen suddenly just send you over the
81:46
edge probably about half the time
81:52
suddenly czar about finances or wealth
81:56
like a lot not like wow someone gave me
82:00
a hundred dollars like a lot we've had
82:04
quite a few sudden ease ourselves so I'm
82:06
asking God to give you some of those
82:08
also amen
82:10
so when I when I heart fire to you I'm
82:15
gonna add suddenly okay say I want the
82:20
Sun lease say I expect them I'm getting
82:25
ready for them I'm serious I really
82:29
wanted God I'm a suddenly son or
82:33
daughter so send it there you go now you
82:39
set yourself up so I just want to get
82:43
ready to lay hands on people it doesn't
82:48
matter how old you are you can have a
82:49
suddenly and you can also have the fiery
82:51
men I see some kids running around
82:56
they're gonna be fierce I'm talking
82:59
about children yeah I have several
83:05
grandchildren that already are fierce so
83:10
I expect them to be fierce amen say
83:13
fierce
83:15
is a good word in this more time of God
83:20
it's passionate remember the word says
83:25
we take it by force so don't do don't be
83:32
mediocre don't be lukewarm you have to
83:38
take it by force amen
83:41
in the time of John the Baptist until
83:43
now the Kingdom of Heaven stirs up and
83:47
encourages for us to be fierce amen and
83:54
dangerous and violent
83:58
say violence in the spirit realm is a
84:04
good thing when we have it that word
84:10
suffers does not mean that heavens being
84:12
beat up by somebody however back to the
84:15
translations God said go read some of
84:20
the translations and see how they have
84:21
translated or interpreted that verse
84:24
from the time of John the Baptist until
84:26
now the Kingdom of Heaven suffers
84:28
violence and the violent take up by
84:30
force and it literally said people are
84:32
running into heaven and stealing things
84:34
I don't know where they got that heaven
84:38
is under attack no I don't believe that
84:42
for a second it's us who are supposed to
84:47
be violently passionate against the
84:51
enemy and we had the right to take back
84:54
whatever he has taken from us because he
84:57
had no right to it Amen I love giving
85:02
revelation in the word - it actually
85:04
makes sense amen training up your child
85:09
and the gift God put in them whether
85:12
it's a drummer or a baker or an interior
85:14
designer in the never depart from that
85:19
gift because they'll be doing the thing
85:22
they love the most that word in there
85:26
says train up a child in the Ben
85:28
or the way he made them that means who
85:34
he sent you as what gift he made you and
85:36
sent you here every good and perfect
85:38
gift comes down from the Father of
85:40
lights and God said everybody sits on
85:42
the few of the chair every Sunday trying
85:45
to figure out what their spiritual gift
85:47
is but one of the most important gifts
85:52
he gave you is your natural gift your
85:54
passion what you love what he made you
85:57
to be or do in this earth that's not
86:00
your job it's the thing you're the most
86:03
passionate about you know your child is
86:05
a drummer if they beat everything
86:07
everything they have they beat on the
86:08
table with it you know straw spoons
86:11
forks whatever it is you buy them a farm
86:15
you know the farm is set for Christmas
86:17
and they pick them up and start beating
86:18
on something with them the cow and the
86:20
horse here they go take them in a
86:22
restaurant they use the straws take them
86:24
outside so they'll be quiet and then
86:26
they break branches off the bush and
86:27
start drumming with the bush say I think
86:31
they're a drummer so raise them up as a
86:35
drummer and they'll never run around the
86:38
world trying to figure out who they are
86:39
does that scripture make sense it's a
86:43
revelation that's how important your
86:46
natural gift is because when you go to
86:49
heaven he plans to use it it's
86:55
irrevocable you meant to be a baker make
86:58
the best brownies or whatever it is you
87:00
make everybody in the neighborhood loves
87:02
them that everybody tells you to sell
87:03
them when you go home to heaven you're
87:05
going to make that and everybody will
87:07
have it for free and everybody will love
87:10
you they have rodeos amusement parks
87:13
because people have gifts that do that
87:16
is that right that's why we have fun in
87:19
heaven and it's so natural they walk in
87:23
heaven and here's all the stuff they
87:25
need to design and to put together
87:26
something that won't take forever to
87:29
make it you're gonna be a baker as part
87:31
of your mansion you have a full out
87:33
kitchen with supernatural devices to use
87:36
and all the supplies you need and then
87:39
out in the front you have a bakery where
87:41
everybody comes body
87:42
your stuff Jesus will visit you
87:45
regularly he has a sweet tooth that's
87:51
why he liked honeycomb remember we
87:54
served on the beach to his disciples
87:56
remember he served him a meal he gave
87:58
them what fish and say honey when it is
88:05
cousin eat locusts and it ran in the
88:10
family say I'm in the family now I know
88:15
why I have a sweet tooth amen
88:20
okay we're going to we're going to do
88:22
this amen so I guess you can get people
88:25
organized unless I tell everybody to
88:28
come one row at a time and I'm gonna
88:30
come down here you're gonna walk up to
88:32
me I'm gonna just zap you with the fire
88:34
God and then what do you want them to do
88:40
next you want him to come and sit yeah
88:42
Margaret stone I couldn't do this
88:45
without mark or actually my team really
88:47
I have a team I have like 15 people now
88:50

00:18
that year and put it in your mansion
00:21
after your welcome home party in the
00:23
throne room which could last for quite a
00:25
while
00:27
your family will come get you and take
00:29
you to your own mansion then they'll
00:30
have
00:31

[Applause]
01:05
i know why jesus loved him so much i
01:07
know why he wanted to be with him i know
01:09
why he
01:09
went away to the mountain to spend time
01:11
with him
01:13
i know how hard it was for him to leave
01:15
home and come here
01:18
okay he was not poor he didn't live poor
01:21
say jesus was not poor
01:27
he became poor when he left heaven
01:30
because heaven is certainly not poor
01:34
there's nothing poor up there nothing
01:37
splendor wonder and beauty
01:40
you couldn't afford to build the house
01:42
that your mansion that
01:43
your mother lives in you won't even have
01:47
the right substances to make it
01:50
the walls sing
01:53
literally they sing they leave you go on
01:56
tours come back they sing
01:57
hello to them the trees uproot
02:00
themselves and they come and
02:01
sit in your house and be your friend for
02:04
a while
02:06
to go back to the friendly forest
02:11
is this okay it's not going to be normal
02:16
no you can't be normal if you've been
02:19
going to heaven for 20 years
02:21
you'd be normal to heaven
02:25
they tell funny stories a lot
02:28
bob jones hasn't stopped
02:35
most people when they go there no matter
02:36
how they were here they're all happy
02:38
they love jokes they love to tell funny
02:41
stories hear funny stories they love it
02:44
they make plans for people before they
02:46
come
02:48
they knew paul was coming
02:52
they all knew paul was coming
02:55
there's a place you go in heaven where
02:57
you find that out
03:01
and you go in this beautiful amazing
03:03
building and
03:05
these supernatural monitors much better
03:08
than ours but these are good
03:10
and you can see who's coming home who's
03:12

03:32
a people have celebrations in the street
03:34
over someone coming
03:36

03:39

03:42
we were loaned
03:43
to the earth for a while when you go
03:46
home
03:47
you're really home and you're not dead
03:51
they don't throw parties for people who
03:53
aren't alive
03:54
[Laughter]
03:57
they have huge celebrations lots of
03:59
music lots of food
04:02
everyone meeting one another visiting
04:07
jesus welcomes you if he isn't taking
04:09
you himself
04:10
sometimes he does take people he comes
04:12
in his own chair flaming horses
04:14
picks you up and takes you up to heaven
04:18
then when you get out you see the sea
04:20
and the mass of people waiting to greet
04:22
you
04:26
and then jesus walks you up the steps of
04:28
the throne to
04:29
give you back to the father
04:32
and then the father reaches out of that
04:36
glory that moves in and out of him the
04:38
living
04:40
colors of the bow coming in and out his
04:42
eyes flames of fire

04:49
you he says welcome home my son

05:13
it's made exactly the way you would love
05:15
it
05:16
but it's made with his presence in the
05:18
walls and the floors and
05:20
it's not going to be a normal shape
05:22
trust me it's not
05:24
all your pets will be there they'll be
05:25
waiting to greet you
05:28

05:41
that represents that year and put it in
05:43
your mansion
05:45

05:47
throne room which could last for quite a
05:49

you to your own mansion then they'll
05:54
have another celebration
06:00

amen god keeps them they live with your
06:21
grandparents or whoever when they get
06:24
there they'll go get them and
06:25
help raise them for a while i love the
06:28
story of a mother
06:30
they lost their son he was either seven
06:32
or eight he was hit by a car
06:35
and they of course they they grieved
06:37
over him but knew he was in heaven
06:39
and i think it was like 20 years later
06:42
or 30 years later one of the other
06:44
she died on the operating table and was
06:47
caught up to heaven
06:48
saw her seven-year-old son playing in
06:52
the streets of gold
06:54
he goes mom wow mom you're here this is
06:57
so exciting
06:58
your mom i'm so glad you're hearing she
07:00
goes what have you been doing goes i've
07:01
been playing with my friends
07:02
what do you think i've been doing
07:06
he'd been living with his grandfather
07:08
and playing with he
07:09
all these friends in the streets of gold
07:10
they were playing and he was laughing
07:12
and he said but you can't come yet
07:14
because it's not your time
07:17
and so she came back never forgot it and
07:20
her and her husband went around the
07:22
world talking about it
07:25
you will be known as you are known
07:28
except you'll look better like a whole
07:32
lot better
07:34
you'll have hair
07:39
most guys that wear their hair about
07:41
down to their shoulders
07:43
don't have you know that's going to
07:44
change y'all i'm just letting you know
07:46
it's going to change guys unless you
07:49
really want like a buzz cut or something
07:51

07:52
marine corps
07:55
my husband may still have one i might be
07:58
surprised to see him
07:59
here he's still with me by the way
08:03
another way to kill me but that was okay
08:12

02:25
how exactly how does the father look
02:28
like
02:29
and what are their operations actually
02:31
in the heaven
02:32
i can tell you're very excited you have
02:34
a lot of questions
02:36
yes yes i do heaven is beyond uh
02:39
the beauty of heaven is is filled with
02:42
wonder
02:43
and splendor every part of it now
02:46
there's amazing parts those profound
02:48
parts like the throne room of god
02:51
where you will actually see the seraphim
02:53
they dip down out of this glory cloud
02:56
over his throne they're continually
02:59
worshipping him
03:00
and the people are in there also the
03:03
redeemed souls the people are in there
03:05
worshiping all the time
03:06
but they have many other things to do
03:08
that god prepared for all of us
03:10
to to enjoy our lives in heaven to be
03:13
with our families and to meet some of
03:15
the apostles and the
03:16
and the prophets i mean they're there
03:18
you can actually see them and meet them
03:20
there
03:21
but there's such honor for each other i
03:23
think one of the most outstanding things
03:25
i noticed when i was there
03:26
how much everybody honored one another
03:28
there's nobody up there that's going to
03:30
reject you
03:32
and nobody's going to hold anything
03:33
against you you know jesus christ
03:36
died for all of us and when we receive
03:38
him as our savior
03:39
that is going to be our home that will
03:41
become our home one day
03:42
amen yeah and so there's many beautiful
03:45
things to see
03:46
and do around heaven uh the the cherubim
03:49
of course they're around the throne of
03:51
god
03:51
all the time declaring holy holy holy
03:55
the throne is kind of high and lifted up
03:57
it's in the middle of the throne room
03:59
it's not like way on the back wall then
04:01
nobody can see
04:02
uh the father or the son they're right
04:06
in the middle
04:06
so people can come up there and see them
04:08
whenever they want to
04:10
and they will hold you and tell you how
04:12
much they love you and they're so glad
04:13
that you've come home to heaven
04:15
it's just a beautiful place there's
04:17
waterfalls everywhere in heaven
04:19
filled with green light and these
04:21
beautiful angels step out of
04:23
the waterfalls they have different
04:25
tribes of angels are created in tribes
04:28
some take care of the forest the
04:30
waterfalls some serve in the throne room
04:33
many you will get to meet when you go to
04:35
heaven your guardian angel
04:37
goes back to heaven when you go there
04:39
the army of heaven is in a different
04:41
area of heaven
04:43
and those angels they call the hosts
04:45
they're very
04:46
powerful and right now they have flooded
04:49
this earth
04:50
right now in this very time that i'm
04:51
speaking and they're here to protect us
04:54
they're here to defend us against the
04:56
enemy our enemy is satan
04:59
satan hates everybody he has no friends
05:01
he doesn't even like his own demons
05:04
and right now when people act like satan
05:06
is because they're being controlled by
05:08
him
05:09
but right now uh where our heavenly home
05:12
is waiting on us
05:13
from the moment that you're born on
05:15
earth when god sends you from himself
05:18
to earth to be born he begins to work on
05:21
your mansion
05:22
so it's not like he does nothing then
05:24
all of a sudden you show up there
05:26
uh it may take many years or even
05:28
generations to finish building your
05:30
mansion because it's so beautiful and
05:32
amazing
05:33
in heaven but when it's done when your
05:35
mansion is done
05:37
that's when you're going to go home to
05:38
heaven sometimes it's when you're very
05:40
old sometimes it's not when you're old
05:42
but no one there is no fear in heaven
05:45
everyone will know you they'll know you
05:47
by your name
05:48
and so these mansions are just
05:51
unspeakably beautiful
05:52
they're not made by human hands they're
05:54
not made by humans who died and moved
05:56
there
05:57
they're made by jesus christ and by his
05:59
father and i'm sure some of the angels
06:01
are also
06:02
involved with building helping to
06:04
embellish the mansions
06:06
but you they will help you find your way
06:08
all around heaven to see other beautiful
06:09
things that god put there
06:11
but his very presence jesus's very
06:14
presence in heaven
06:15
is felt no matter where you are there is
06:18
a way that everyone can be with him
06:20
individually uh many times he'll walk
06:23
around the masses in heaven
06:26
the beautiful thing is even the flowers
06:28
will sing to jesus christ
06:30
so heaven is a little bit different than
06:31
this earth like uh the creatures which
06:34
we would call animals on the earth
06:36
many of them also worship even the ocean
06:39
in heaven the crystal sea
06:41
even it worships jesus christ and you
06:44
will walk over these rainbow bridges
06:46
uh to get to the other side even the sea
06:49
creatures worship
06:50
everything worships the lord in heaven
06:54
and so uh people get so undone when they
06:56
first go there
06:57
when you get to heaven your family
06:59
members will be waiting on you
07:01
and trust me if you belong to jesus
07:03
christ there's no way
07:04
that you won't go to heaven you have to
07:07
understand of course that
07:09
that is the only way to heaven is
07:11
through the blood of jesus christ
07:13
and he is aware of what's going on down
07:15
here
07:16
he's with us all the time even while
07:18
we're here and so the throne room is one
07:20
of the most beautiful places in heaven
07:23
uh there's like gold golden the stone is
07:26
like gold
07:27
the rainbow moves in and out of the
07:29
father you see all the waves of the
07:31
rainbow moving in and out of him
07:33
it's very beautiful to experience just
07:36
being in his presence
07:37
and you really understand that he is
07:39
your father in heaven
07:41
and that he did send his son to die for
07:43
all of us here on this earth so
07:46
i have to say love and love is probably
07:49
the most
07:50
wonderful thing all over heaven
07:52
everything is just bathed in love you'll
07:54
never feel alone
07:56
you're never concerned um everything
07:59
that
07:59
you you need is given to you and there's
08:02
also
08:02
places to go in heaven that god made for
08:05
us to enjoy
08:06
there's beautiful art being even people
08:08
can like paint the skies of heaven
08:10
you don't have to just paint like a
08:12
canvas uh
08:14
so many ways that people can do things
08:16
in heaven that we can't do on this earth
08:18
and god prepared all of that for us the
08:21
bible says in my father's house
08:23
are many mansions and i've seen many
08:27
many of those mansions in heaven some
08:29
are very different
08:31
um a lot of people would like to be like
08:33
near the mountains
08:34
so the mansions could be built in the
08:36
mountains in heaven or by the crystal
08:38
sea
08:39
many people's mansions are built there
08:41
uh it's just a beautiful place
08:44
and i know there's peace i know there's
08:45
peace because christ is there
08:47
you have no more laborers you know you
08:49
get to use the gift that god made you to
08:51
be on the earth
08:53
if you work with fabric you'll do it in
08:54
heaven and make beautiful things for
08:56
jesus christ and other people when they
08:59
come to heaven they'll make beautiful
09:00
things that that you can put in your
09:01
mansion
09:02
there's no money in heaven so nothing
09:05
cost anything
09:06
all these things are freely given or
09:08
made by people
09:09
and that's their delight to do that so
09:13
you're never going to have an argument
09:14
in heaven you're not going to be
09:15
rejected in heaven
09:17
it's just the most wonderful place that
09:19
you would want to be and
09:20
there with your family members even all
09:23
the little babies are there
09:24
waiting on their parents to get there
09:26
those that didn't make it all the way to
09:28
birth
09:29
so it is beyond your imagination
09:32
and that and yet we all have a loving
09:34
father we have the same loving father
09:36
in heaven and when you go home you go
09:38
home as his son or his daughter
09:40
and he's already made that beautiful
09:42
place for you if anybody has recently
09:44
lost somebody i don't know why they use
09:47
the word lost
09:49
because if you're going to heaven you're
09:50
not lost okay
09:53
you're moving it's like you're moving
09:54
from this place
09:56
into a beautiful place in heaven being
09:58
somewhat i tell people that's how we
10:00
need to look at it just like that that
10:01
we're moving
10:03
your body may be sleeping but your
10:05
spiritual body inside of you looks just
10:07
like you it's
10:08
young and uh there's nothing no sickness
10:12
no disease no handicap people in heaven
10:15
everyone is made whole
10:17
and so it's just really everybody
10:19
celebrates in heaven
10:21
even when one person comes home there
10:23
they celebrate
10:24
so it's really a beautiful place thank
10:27
you thank you so much
10:28
you know cat i was listening i have been
10:29
listening to you since 2012.
10:32
maybe you may not know about it but i
10:33
was i know
10:35
every uh every i have covered every
10:37
session of yours
10:38
every session i know all the answers you
10:41
know for all the questions that i have
10:42
jotted down
10:43
but the thing is i want all my indian
10:45
friends and the believers
10:46
to know about heaven to know about god
10:49
the characteristics of god
10:51
hallelujah so the second question is can
10:53
you talk about
10:54
trinity and brief us on each personality
10:57
father son and the holy spirit yes well
11:01
i think one of the most
11:02
wonderful times i was caught up to
11:04
heaven the father wanted to
11:07
show me what the trinity was because
11:09
everyone
11:11
knows that they call themselves the
11:12
three in one
11:14
yeah the triune godhead and that
11:17
actually means there are three
11:18
individual beings
11:20
that have the ability to go inside of
11:23
each other i know it's a satin strange
11:25
but this is exactly how he showed me he
11:27
caught me up
11:28
and there was a father sitting on the
11:30
throne there was jesus christ next to
11:32
him
11:32
and the holy spirit and i know he's sort
11:34
of invisible but you can see the fire
11:36
going around him
11:37
or bands of color so you know that is
11:40
holy spirit right there
11:41
he actually does have a body on earth
11:43
that would be invisible in heaven not
11:45
not so much invisible and the father
11:47
said here we are
11:49
three individual beings father son and
11:52
holy spirit
11:53
all three are gods and he said and then
11:57
he said my son will step inside of me so
12:00
jesus got up and stepped right inside of
12:02
his father
12:03
and then the holy spirit came and
12:04
stepped inside of the father and the
12:06
father said now we are the three
12:08
and one so the three separate beings
12:11
all of them gods and our gods and so
12:14
jesus christ came you know to die for
12:16
our sins the father
12:17
is the one who carries all of life in
12:19
him and when the baby is born on the
12:22
earth
12:22
at the time of conception holy spirit
12:25
brings that little baby spirit that's
12:28
living inside the father literally and
12:30
he brings it and knits it and attaches
12:32
it to the mother's womb
12:34
now many people know the scripture says
12:36
i knit you together
12:38
in your mother's womb but they don't
12:39
know that means a literal he really does
12:42
that little spiritual being that's you
12:44
gets attached at the time of conception
12:47
and then your body and your spirit will
12:49
become one
12:50
until of course the day that you die and
12:53
when you die
12:54
the mystery about that is this body
12:56
remains behind
12:58
but your spiritual self that is you that
13:01
you really can touch
13:02
feel eat enjoy yourself in heaven
13:05
that is taken home by your own angel
13:08
takes you back to heaven
13:09
and gives and jesus takes you and gives
13:11
you back to the father
13:12
and so jesus is probably the king of
13:15
course he's the king
13:16
he's more of the the warrior type but he
13:19
also
13:20
loves not each one of them love but they
13:22
each have a different
13:23
thing that they mainly do the father
13:25
carries life inside of himself
13:27
the rainbow is generated from inside
13:29
himself it says lightnings and thunders
13:31
come from him
13:33
but those lightnings in heaven that come
13:35
from him are love
13:36
they're like love and so holy spirit of
13:39
course
13:40
he carries he is the spirit of god and
13:42
he comes down to this earth and he
13:44
he he you know calls people to
13:48
become to a savior i mean a savior
13:52
he calls you to the savior so that you
13:54
can become born again
13:55
the holy spirit also comes alongside you
13:58
when you're on the earth
13:59
and he helps to guide you and he shows
14:01
you the word of god
14:03
and so he also will fill you with
14:05
himself
14:06
and then you can speak in that heavenly
14:08
language you can speak in tongues
14:10
and actually when you speak in tongues
14:11
that's a language when you speak in
14:14
tongues and you pray in tongues
14:16
the enemy the devil cannot understand
14:18
what you're saying it's like a part of
14:20
heaven that gets put in you and you
14:21
communicate directly
14:23
with the father with the son with the
14:26
holy spirit
14:27
so holy spirit definitely causes all
14:29
kind of drama on the earth
14:31
when uh you know when he moves upon
14:33
people to draw you to christ
14:35
and there's going to be a lot of
14:37
movement of the holy spirit on the earth
14:38
right now
14:39
drawing many people to jesus christ so
14:42
they each have
14:43
a different type of a personality uh but
14:46
they're all still
14:47
god amen amen thank you so much
14:50
right uh how often you go to heaven
14:54
can everyone go heaven and if yes how
14:58
i am just caught up usually by the
15:01
spirit of god
15:02
unless jesus comes in person and just
15:04
takes me i'm not taken in this physical
15:06
body my physical body stays behind
15:09
my spiritual body is taken up to heaven
15:11
whenever they want to show me something
15:13
or teach me something to teach believers
15:16
on the earth
15:17
sometimes they'll take me forward in
15:18
time and show me something
15:20
that's going to happen it's
15:23
almost always good news i'm not one of
15:26
the prophets that
15:27
maybe be shown great destruction and
15:30
wicked things you know so that people
15:32
are warned by that
15:34
god shows me the celebrations the moves
15:36
of god
15:38
his plans for different parts of the
15:40
earth right now he's moving over the
15:42
whole earth
15:44
it could be any time i usually go more
15:46
than once a day
15:47
most days and sometimes they'll just
15:50
jesus would like
15:51
walk through the wall of my room and
15:53
you'll sit and talk with
15:54
me and i know some people that sound
15:56
strange it's
15:58
normal it's like breathing to me it's as
16:01
simple as breathing i don't cause it to
16:03
happen
16:04
i have a i have a commission to be a
16:07
revealer i reveal heaven to the earth so
16:10
therefore
16:11
they call me a revelator and uh holy
16:14
spirit has caught me up the father has
16:16
caught me up
16:16
jesus has caught me up at different
16:18
times and usually i will be like if i
16:21
was sitting here
16:22
and all of a sudden they came and took
16:23
me i would just sit here and not
16:25
speak my body would just remain here if
16:28
my husband comes looking for me
16:30
and i'm not moving or saying anything
16:32
he'll just say well i'll come back later
16:35
and then he leaves and whatever god's
16:37
doing with me
16:38
he waits of course to avenge his then he
16:40
come back and he just sticks my spirit
16:41
back in my body
16:44
and i've seen many places in heaven or
16:46
you show me things about to come on the
16:48
earth
16:48
and i'm like i feel like a little child
16:51
when i'm up there
16:52
so when he speaks to me he doesn't speak
16:54
to me in big words that people would
16:56
have a hard time understanding
16:58
he speaks to me like i'm about eight
17:00
years old i feel like i'm about eight
17:02
years old when i'm in heaven
17:04
i'm always excited i'm always happy
17:07
i'm always blessed that they allow me to
17:10
do that
17:11
and they've been doing it for over 20
17:13
years so i stopped counting
17:15
a long time ago it's not about how many
17:18
times he took me it's the purpose he
17:20
wanted me to go
17:22
is so that people would know that he he
17:24
exists that he loves them
17:26
how heaven operates was the right word
17:28
to use because
17:30
they do have a way to operate god puts a
17:32
gift in every person when he brings us
17:35
here to the earth
17:36
when we come here as those little
17:37
spirits we are have a like
17:40
my gift actually is a photographer and
17:43
it
17:43
is my passion it's what i think about
17:45
all the time unless
17:46
he's showing me things to talk about i
17:49
want to take pictures
17:51
i love it i know that when i go to
17:53
heaven one day i will have my own studio
17:56
and there'll be even more fantastic ways
17:58
to
17:59
make photographs so even though i i'm a
18:02
prophet
18:03
and a revelator and of course i have
18:05
many other
18:06
things that god asked me to do but my
18:09
number one gift besides being a daughter
18:11
of god
18:12
and you know um a believer in jesus
18:15
christ
18:16
is a photographer so whatever that
18:19
passion maybe you like to work with
18:20
fabric maybe
18:21
maybe you like to bake things or or
18:23
create things or design
18:25
things and you love that that's not
18:27
necessarily a talent it's something that
18:29
you were just
18:30
born with to do maybe it's singing mine
18:33
is not singing
18:35
but i can share i'm taken and i have a
18:38
photographic memory which means
18:40
i remember everything i saw all the
18:43
words i heard the music i heard
18:45
if i tasted food what did that taste
18:47
like and so i
18:49
store all that in my soul
18:52
and it just stays there i don't forget
18:54
it so i don't have a very normal
18:57
job of course it's not but i'm just
19:00
sharing with everybody
19:01
what they also will experience one day
19:04
when they go to heaven
19:05
and that's really the father's purpose
19:07
for taking me
19:08
and i've seen so many i've seen
19:10
thousands of places in heaven
19:12
and uh there's different areas actually
19:15
that god has things in heaven
19:17
like valley the falls or passionate
19:19
paradise is about worshiping christ
19:22
there's a friendly forest i could just
19:24
go on and on the mountain of spices
19:27
i've seen all these beautiful places in
19:29
heaven and then he asked me to write a
19:31
book i didn't plan to write a book jesus
19:33
came in person to me
19:35
and said the father and i want you to
19:37
write books about heaven
19:39
so people on this earth will know it's
19:41
real that it's not something that's made
19:43
up
19:44
is something that we want to invite them
19:45
all to be a part of
19:47
you know by receiving of course christ
19:49
saying this by receiving me as your
19:51
savior christ as your savior
19:53
and so that's why i get taken but as far
19:56
as when i get taken i could be pulling
19:58
in my driveway and i turn the car off
20:00
and they take me i could be in the
20:02
grocery store reaching for something on
20:04
the shelf
20:05
and in the time it would take someone to
20:06
put their hand on that thing
20:08
and then hesitate for a second
20:11
and then put it in their cart i could
20:13
have been maybe into five places in
20:14
heaven
20:15
it's that quick because there's no time
20:18
and having there's no clocks there's no
20:20
calendars so there's no limit to what
20:22
you can show me
20:24
in those few seconds of taking that
20:26
touching that
20:27
and then putting it in my cart and so
20:29
i've been many places sitting on the
20:31
front row in the church waiting to speak
20:33
he'd catch me up to heaven and show me
20:35
somebody who had just arrived in heaven
20:37
and want me to testify to that i could
20:40
be walking somewhere and he would take
20:42
me
20:43
and i could even be visiting people and
20:45
he would take me
20:46
so sitting in a restaurant uh sometimes
20:49
he actually comes in and sits next to me
20:51
in the restaurant
20:52
and i begin to shake and he'll begin to
20:54
speak to me and then sometimes he'll
20:55
take me
20:56
now if he takes me my body remembers
20:58
just gonna sit right there
21:02
it i never know really i almost never
21:04
get a warning he just comes and just
21:06
takes me
21:07
and i don't say i don't say no i say
21:10
yeah
21:11
he's i mean uh we going to heaven is it
21:14
only limited to certain number of people
21:17
or is it totally dependent on the
21:18
relationship
21:20
that you build with god
21:23
i mean is it very selective is it very
21:25
selective i mean it's a question it's
21:26
just a question
21:28
i mean we going to heaven is it like
21:30
this is it like
21:31
god is selective about people or it
21:34
belongs to everyone you know based on
21:37
the relationship that they build
21:39
with the father oh are you talking about
21:42
whether he takes you to heaven or not
21:44
yes without dying is that what you're
21:46
saying no no no what i'm saying is
21:48
we going to heaven is it i mean yeah
21:57
the only way you can go to heaven anyone
21:59
who receives
22:00
jesus christ as their savior repents of
22:03
their sins and receives him as their
22:05
savior
22:06
that washes all your sin away that's
22:08
what gives you entrance into heaven
22:10
and anyone who does that no matter where
22:12
they are in this world
22:14
how old they are what their position is
22:16
uh up until that moment
22:18
until you receive christ you don't have
22:21
the right to enter into heaven
22:23
because you know we're born into sin but
22:25
anyone who receives him no matter where
22:27
they are
22:29
yes they're they are going to go to
22:31
heaven and that's the purpose of christ
22:33
coming to deserve
22:34
the bible says that god desires that
22:37
none
22:38
should perish that none should end up in
22:40
hell but
22:41
there will be people who refuse christ
22:43
or just decide they don't want him
22:46
and so it's very important to make sure
22:48
that even young
22:50
that people receive jesus christ i was
22:52
four years old and i knew exactly what i
22:54
was doing
22:55
i knew i was receiving christ as my
22:57
savior i'm sure i couldn't have
22:59
committed
22:59
many sins at that time but i still
23:01
repented of them anyway
23:03
and i actually i had this sounds up
23:06
without
23:07
i'm also a seer which means i see in the
23:10
spirit realm the bible talks about the
23:11
unseen
23:12
realm and so that's why i'm able to see
23:14
angels all the time or demons all the
23:16
time
23:17
and so when i received christ as my
23:19
savior i actually saw him step inside of
23:21
me
23:22
it says in the bible that he indwells us
23:24
you know that he
23:26
he remains inside of us and i know he
23:28
can be in people many people everywhere
23:30
all at the same time
23:32
but when you receive christ that's what
23:34
gives you entrance into heaven
23:36
and then after you receive christ you
23:38
continue to pursue
23:40
a relationship even when you're on the
23:41
earth to spend time with christ
23:43
even if you don't see him you need to
23:45
say you're you're
23:47
so blessed that he received you that he
23:49
is your king that he is your savior
23:51
and you can't wait to be with him in
23:53
eternity and so no
23:55
it's not for a special group it's not
23:57
for a special
23:58
even you know denomination everybody has
24:02
now i will say this
24:04
jesus christ you can you can pick any
24:07
religion you want to
24:08
but not all of them take you to heaven
24:11
the one that says you must receive jesus
24:13
christ as your savior in the bible
24:15
john 3 16 that right there is what gives
24:18
you entrance into heaven but it is
24:20
available to anyone who wants to do that
24:23
okay i'm talking about in this life like
24:25
you you you are being caught up like
24:27
john the revelator
24:28
oh okay like johnny
24:32
about people you know who is going to
24:34
caught up to heaven or
24:35
anybody who desires i'm sure the father
24:38
has
24:38
everything to do with who comes um it's
24:41
his home right
24:42
didn't jesus say in my father's house
24:44
heaven is the father's home
24:46
and i'm sure that i know that he catches
24:49
many different people up
24:50
and i tell people you can ask him and
24:52
after you ask him thank him that you're
24:54
going to get to go
24:56
but i myself i never asked to be caught
24:59
up to having
24:59
shown anything i was born again for many
25:02
many many years i was born
25:04
again in 1956 and then in 1996
25:08
jesus came to me and said the father and
25:10
he were going to start taking me to
25:12
heaven
25:13
for the purpose to reveal heaven to
25:15
earth so they told me i would be going a
25:17
lot
25:18
all the time whenever they chose to take
25:20
me whatever they showed
25:21
they chose to tell me or show me that i
25:24
was allowed to share on the earth
25:27
so that's the commission it's a little
25:29
bit different than just being
25:30
you know it's not that i'm better than
25:32
somebody it's just i have a
25:34
it's like my my commission from god
25:37
himself
25:38
i have a photographic memory i'm like
25:40
seventh generation christian which made
25:42
me
25:42
a lot more open to the father saying i
25:45
need you to share this
25:47
i'm going to show you this you know i'm
25:49
delighted no matter where he takes me
25:51
and if you stop taking me i'd still be
25:53
happy
25:55
i don't want to stay in heaven actually
25:56
when they show me things i can't wait
25:58
for them to bring me back so i can share
26:01
so it's a little bit different i just
26:03
know that as
26:03
years go by he's taking more and more
26:05
people just to give them a glimpse of
26:07
what's up there
26:08
and we all know paul saw heaven we know
26:11
john the revelator saw heaven in the
26:13
book of
26:13
uh revelations and also in john so um
26:17
there were people even in the bible that
26:18
were caught up to heaven without dying
26:20
it was for god's purpose we know ezekiel
26:23
saw isaiah
26:24
saw it i mean abraham saw parts of it
26:26
and so
26:27
many people even in the bible so that
26:29
shouldn't be strange to people
26:30
on the earth that god is able to do that
26:33
i'm also sure the holy spirit catches
26:35
people up and takes him
26:37
up up to heaven because it says you know
26:39
um
26:41
it said that no one no eye has seen your
26:43
ear heard nor entered in the heart or
26:45
mind of man
26:46
but god has prepared for us on the earth
26:50
except it'd be revealed by the spirit of
26:53
god and that could be the father that
26:54
could be holy spirit
26:56
or that could be jesus and any one of
26:58
those could catch people up to heaven
27:00
sometimes he'd catch several people up
27:02
out of a meeting
27:03
and then they'd come back and testify
27:05
about it trust me you'll know if you
27:07
went there
27:08
people get so excited they can't stop
27:10
talking about it
27:11
but i'm not saying it's impossible for
27:13
just anybody to go that's not true
27:15
but if you were given a commission like
27:18
different people in the bible had a
27:19
commission like
27:20
abraham had his commission moses had his
27:22
he had to
27:23
lead the people out into the promised
27:25
land and even noah had a commission he
27:27
had to build the ark
27:28
and so it wasn't that necessary that
27:31
that god loved him more
27:33
this is it he knew in their heart they
27:36
would
27:37
live holy and he knew that they would
27:39
say yes when he asked for something
27:42
you have to be willing and obedient when
27:44
god says i'm giving you
27:45
and it might be to go feed the children
27:48
in the world you know it might be to
27:49
start a mission somewhere
27:51
it might be to start a business
27:53
somewhere that would help people with
27:54
new ideas and things
27:56
and that's what they're called to do
27:58
it's like like i'm not
27:59
a pastor and i'm not necessarily a
28:02
teacher
28:03
i'm not an evangelist but i am somebody
28:05
who has a commission from god
28:07
and besides being a prophet god shows me
28:10
many things to come
28:11
i am also a revelator and that means
28:13
that i will reveal the things of god
28:16
it could be from the future it could be
28:18
in the past it could be right now on
28:20
this earth what's going on
28:21
but mainly reveal heaven to this earth
28:24
and then
28:25
to create things in the earth that would
28:27
represent heaven that people could have
28:29
if they could wear or hold
28:30
or something to look at god wants this
28:34
world he wants people to know that he is
28:36
real
28:37
his son is real holy spirit is real and
28:40
that heaven is real
28:41
and so that is a commission but i'm not
28:44
saying it's impossible for others to go
28:45
i've even known him to catch people up
28:47
that weren't even born again yet
28:49
they were so shocked when they got there
28:51
they were so undone
28:53
by by heaven when as soon as they got
28:56
back they got born again
29:00
thank you so much i have many questions
29:02
but you are just answering you know all
29:04
of the questions in one question
29:05
you know what i'm asking that's how it
29:08
happened
29:09
that's this is how it happens what is
29:12
grace
29:13
and abundant grace can you differentiate
29:15
and how do we apply that
29:17
uh the grace and the abundant grace how
29:19
do we apply it in our lives
29:21
well there's actually this grace for
29:23
eternal life we know the bible talks
29:25
about that right
29:27
by the grace of god we are saved it's
29:30
not anything about
29:32
how much money we have or how smart we
29:34
are
29:35
or or even how old we are it's
29:38
the grace of god is what we get because
29:41
his son was willing to die
29:43
god makes that grace eternal life grace
29:46
available to anybody who pursues it who
29:49
who enters into that
29:51
covenant with christ and so that's grace
29:54
but there is another grace
29:56
it's called abundant life grace
29:59
and the father in the scripture says to
30:02
come before
30:03
my throne of this is the father speaking
30:05
come before my throne of grace
30:07
to find help and grace in time of need
30:12
abundant life grace and jesus by the way
30:15
was filled with that grace that grace
30:18
the father's grace
30:20
he gave it to his son so when his son
30:23
came you know
30:24
here jesus said i come to give what life
30:27
and life more abundantly and he didn't
30:31
have to ask for that grace
30:32
it says in the bible the father filled
30:35
his son with
30:36
that grace abundant life grace when
30:38
christ was a child i'm sure that was
30:40
because abundant life grace
30:42
is like fuel from heaven and you know
30:45
normally we would ask for that grace
30:48
like i ask every day father i ask for
30:50
and receive grace for abundant life
30:53
this day and when i say those words i
30:56
feel literally it feels like like a
30:59
light
30:59
electricity coming over me and that is
31:02
fueled from heaven for that day can you
31:05
actually make us do that ma'am
31:07
huh can you make us do that can you make
31:09
us ask for grace
31:11
can you teach us how to do that i mean
31:13
when the when the father
31:14
wanted me to understand something he
31:16
actually had me do it myself
31:18
so he called me up and he said put your
31:20
hands out in front of you
31:22
and so i did and he said i need you to
31:24
say these words
31:25
father father i ask for
31:29
i ask for i want everyone to repeat who
31:31
is watching live i ask for
31:34
and receive grace and receive grace
31:37
for abundant life for abundant life
31:41
this day this day
31:44
in jesus name in jesus name amen and you
31:48
know right now
31:49
i feel it i i really feel it coming into
31:52
me
31:52
i know everybody can't but but some
31:55
people begin to when you begin to do
31:57
this
31:58
and the reason why you do it 24 every 24
32:01
hours
32:01
a day it runs out and nobody can tell me
32:05
it doesn't run out
32:07
because if i forget to do that i don't
32:09
always act
32:11
maybe so nice i'm still a believer and
32:14
jen and i
32:15
are some of the best testimonies for
32:17
this because
32:18
jen loose me and listen with me and my
32:20
husband so does my mom
32:21
so all of us separately every day
32:25
when we're saying our prayers in the
32:26
morning we will say that prayer
32:28
and if somebody doesn't say it and they
32:30
come out of the room
32:32
they don't act the same because you
32:34
didn't get fuel from heaven
32:36
yes now that abundant life grace is also
32:38
available
32:39
for any believer who asked and it will
32:42
stop you from getting stressed out
32:45
angry frustr frustrated especially
32:48
stressed any of those things that that
32:51
combat you all day long
32:53
somebody people saying not nice things
32:55
to you that that abundant life grace
32:57
will either even cover that
32:59
it likes it covers you from things
33:01
penetrating you
33:03
and so i would say it's definitely worth
33:05
it it was one of the first things the
33:06
father taught me he said when you come
33:08
out of that room
33:10
i don't want you and just your fleshly
33:12
attitude
33:13
even as a believer you know we can have
33:15
opinions and we're not so nice sometimes
33:17
to people
33:18
i don't want that coming out with you so
33:20
you will ask for this grace
33:22
every day and i will fill you with
33:24
abundant life grace
33:26
every day and there's a total difference
33:29
when i come out of that room
33:32
rarely do i come out without it but
33:34
everybody knows because i'm like why did
33:35
somebody not do this why is that not
33:37
done
33:38
how come nobody took it why didn't
33:39
anybody tell me this but if i
33:42
if i'm filled with that grace and i come
33:44
out of the room and go
33:45
how are you today isn't this a beautiful
33:47
day
33:48
and it's like because i'm filled already
33:51
with heaven for that whole day
33:54
and you will find out that you respond
33:57
differently to people that you stay
33:59
excited and happy and we try to teach
34:02
this to most of our staff because then
34:03
that means
34:04
our day is going to be really nice too
34:08
as well as there so it's free
34:11
and so you just have to ask for that
34:13
yeah even i could make out the
34:15
difference you know
34:16
whenever i don't ask for grace so i
34:19
keep asking every day and the day would
34:22
be amazing
34:24
and i want to give one example in the
34:26
bible about where
34:27
christ uh taught at somebody it was it
34:31
was
34:31
paul you remember when paul kept asking
34:34
christ take the thorn of flesh away from
34:36
me it keeps buffeting me
34:37
i don't want it bothering me so paul was
34:40
getting aggravated and frustrated and
34:42
what did christ say to him
34:44
my grace is sufficient for you
34:47
for the day for the evil thereof and
34:49
what christ was saying was
34:51
this abundant life grace will cover that
34:54
so that it doesn't affect you like that
34:56
and you notice he said every day
34:59
so trust me don't argue just ask for
35:02
that abundant life graciously
35:04
receive it and you will be ahead of the
35:06
game when you get out there
35:08
into this world is not so nice right so
35:10
we need all that we can
35:12
to make us a better christian amen amen
35:15
true
35:16
can you talk about spirit soul and body
35:19
and the next question is
35:20
what is soul cleansing and how do we do
35:23
that
35:24
okay first you can talk about spirit
35:25
soul and body and then you can tell us
35:28
about the soul cleansing okay
35:30
we are made in three parts and isn't
35:33
that
35:33
amazing okay there's father son and holy
35:37
spirit
35:38
and we we are made in we're a three-part
35:41
being
35:41
we are body that's our physical body our
35:45
soul was actually the very core of our
35:47
being
35:48
and we are spirit we are made in all
35:50
three
35:51
and there's a reason why he made us that
35:53
way your soul
35:55
is actually like the core of your being
35:58
it would be like your engine
36:00
if you were a car whatever you put in
36:02
the engine of that vehicle
36:04
determines how well it runs well that is
36:07
the same way with your soul
36:09
your soul is your mind so even your soul
36:11
has three parts isn't that wild
36:13
so body soul and then spirit your spirit
36:17
man
36:17
and then in your soul itself it is your
36:20
mind
36:21
what you think about your will what you
36:24
choose and your emotions
36:26
that's what you're going to how you're
36:27
going to display your feelings uh the
36:29
things you say
36:30
how you treat people how you respond and
36:32
two things
36:34
it will affect everything that soul will
36:36
it's very important to understand that
36:39
the bible says that we are living souls
36:42
that's how important it is to understand
36:44
that you all you have that soul
36:46
part of you is very important it's not
36:48
something you ignore yes it gets saved
36:50
it gets bored again
36:52
but there's so much more to it than that
36:54
and so the body you have to have the
36:56
body
36:57
to live in the earth but there's a
37:00
reason why you need that body
37:02
because spirits cannot rule in this
37:04
earth
37:05
they will try to take authority or
37:06
they'll try to you know they'll try to
37:08
step kill steal and destroy
37:10
i'm talking about the demonic spirits
37:12
angels are present here to help us all
37:14
the time
37:15
uh and so the spirits are here to help
37:17
if they're gods
37:19
and to do bad things against you
37:22
if they belong to the devil but you
37:25
have to have flesh do you have authority
37:28
in the earth
37:29
and god said let us make man in our
37:31
image and
37:32
after the way we operate and even jesus
37:36
when he came he had to have flesh put on
37:39
him
37:40
why so he could have authority to speak
37:43
spiritually against the darkness or
37:47
to heal people so even christ had to
37:50
have that flesh in order to have
37:51
authority in the earth
37:53
also to die on the cross so he had to
37:55
have that flesh the flesh
37:57
is very important it's like your suit i
38:00
tell people it's your earth suit
38:02
and so you need that to be in the earth
38:04
to live in this atmosphere
38:06
god made a whole physical realm and put
38:08
this world and the other worlds in the
38:10
physical realm
38:11
um because heaven itself is a spiritual
38:14
world
38:14
where you will go and live in your
38:16
spirit and one day when the dead in
38:18
christ
38:19
were raised that was your body
38:22
that remained behind when you went to
38:24
heaven it died and went in the ground
38:26
there'll be a day when all our bodies
38:28
are resurrected and god
38:29
takes their spirit man and puts it back
38:32
in that body and it will be
38:33
together forever he won't ever separate
38:36
us again
38:37
and then he will glorify that body
38:40
uh for eternity and to be immortal which
38:43
means you can never die
38:44
so but you have to have this body to
38:46
have authority in the earth
38:48
that's why the devil tries to use people
38:51
to get them to do wicked things
38:53
satan can't just do everything himself
38:55
and take over he'd like to
38:57
even right now he can't totally do that
39:00
but see he has to have a flesh that he
39:03
can impress and he can deceive
39:04
satan so you can abuse it but god needs
39:07
us
39:08
we're his witnesses in the earth we were
39:10
sent from heaven to earth to be a
39:12
witness and a testimony to him
39:14
that he is real that he loves he loves
39:16
everybody here
39:18
and god doesn't like violence at all and
39:20
the enemy
39:21
uses the violence you know you know the
39:23
bible says satan comes to kill steal and
39:25
destroy
39:26
and he only can do that if you give him
39:29
permission or you don't know you have
39:31
authority
39:32
with jesus christ and there's a lot more
39:34
to all of this that i could say
39:36
but i didn't want to explain so you are
39:39
made in three parts
39:41
your soul which is at the very core of
39:43
your being sometimes the bible calls it
39:45
the heart
39:47
the word heart doesn't mean this
39:48
physical beating heart it means the very
39:50
core of you the heart of something is
39:52
the center of something
39:54
and that is your soul so what you watch
39:56
with your eyes
39:57
or what you hear with your ears will go
40:00
in that soul and it's so important to
40:02
make sure you don't
40:03
you don't let evil things go in and you
40:06
don't let evil words come out of your
40:08
mouth
40:09
whatever is edifying your people
40:10
whichever gives them hope and life god
40:13
says to speak life and to choose life
40:15
and so what you do every day not just
40:18
once but what you do every day in the
40:21
decisions you make every day
40:22
either makes you once you're born again
40:25
it either makes you a better christian
40:27
or a weaker christian so make sure that
40:30
what you're filling your soul with
40:32
is what god would want you to put there
40:34
okay things that bring
40:35
life joy celebration his word
40:38
his presence god's plans that's what
40:42
needs to be in our soul
40:43
and by the way the more you put of him
40:45
in your soul the light that comes from
40:48
you
40:48
if you could see the light come
40:49
everybody has light coming from them
40:51
it comes out of your spirit so the more
40:53
of god you
40:54
have by reading his word by listening to
40:57
him by obeying him
40:59
that light gets brighter and brighter so
41:01
you can see
41:02
we're all specially made so that
41:05
explains that
41:06
now i want to explain what do you do if
41:08
you get stuff inside of you
41:10
you shouldn't have seen it maybe you
41:11
watched a really horrid terror horror
41:13
movie or something
41:14
you should never do that because then
41:16
that opens up attacks from the enemy
41:18
i don't allow anything like that to be
41:20
in me
41:21
and so or maybe you had a trauma when
41:24
you were younger or even now where you
41:26
were hurt or abused yourself
41:28
that puts trauma in your soul which will
41:30
affect you you don't want to keep that
41:32
in there
41:33
uh maybe you said maybe you got a fight
41:36
with somebody and just slashed them you
41:37
know with your words and trash and maybe
41:39
you even said profanity which
41:41
by the way the only one who speaks
41:43
profanity is hell i always tell people
41:45
profanity is hell's language you don't
41:47
ever want to say
41:48
that you don't ever want to be mean or
41:50
get offended with people
41:52
these this mouth was meant to help if
41:55
you belong to christ
41:56
and so if you get filled with all this
41:58
junk you can imagine
41:59
if you didn't know christ and maybe for
42:01
the first 30 40 years you just lived in
42:04
the world and you acted like the world
42:06
you have a lot of stuff to get out of
42:08
here
42:09
and god made a way for that to happen
42:12
it's actually called
42:13
the keys to the kingdom which you lose
42:16
you choose with your will
42:17
as a believer to lose anything out of
42:20
your soul
42:20
maybe you went and watched the movie
42:22
about witchcraft that's not a wise thing
42:24
don't read books about witchcraft don't
42:27
keep any
42:28
anything that are emblems or things that
42:30
would be used in
42:31
in anything with witchcraft and rituals
42:34
or anything
42:35
get rid of all that stuff i mean get the
42:36
stuff out of your house and get rid of
42:38
it
42:38
but this house is the most important
42:41
thing to keep things out of
42:43
okay maybe you got offended at somebody
42:45
you wouldn't speak to them for ten years
42:46
you were so angry with them
42:48
that shouldn't be in you if you're a
42:49
believer the anger shouldn't be there
42:52
uh if you got addicted to even stuff
42:54
addicted to drugs or addicted to other
42:56
things
42:57
that addiction gets a hold in your soul
43:00
it does it gets in your soul
43:02
and you need to get all of those things
43:04
out of you
43:05
why so you can be a testimony to jesus
43:07
christ
43:08
so you can live free of fear of hate
43:12
offense unforgiveness any addictions you
43:15
know
43:16
especially fear because satan ridley
43:18
right now is trying to use fear
43:20
but you don't have to carry any of that
43:22
god made your soul
43:24
that it could be free and why do i say
43:27
that because of the scripture
43:29
god desires above everything else
43:32
that you prosper and live in
43:35
health how about that well how does that
43:37
happen
43:38
then it says even as your soul prospers
43:43
you will prosper and then you will be in
43:45
hell
43:46
so if your soul is filled with all of
43:48
this stuff
43:49
from the world or or whatever else
43:52
you've taken in you
43:53
your soul can't prosper why it's got
43:57
junk in it and so according to that
43:59
scripture
44:01
you have to get that stuff out of your
44:02
soul so you can then be
44:04
free and it says it's what it says as
44:07
your soul prospers as you keep that
44:08
stuff
44:09
out and put god in you you should begin
44:12
to prosper
44:13
financially uh emotionally
44:17
relationally with other people you
44:19
should increase in every way
44:21
and you shouldn't have sickness in you
44:24
how about that
44:25
a lot of the reasons people are sick is
44:27
what is in their soul
44:29
maybe it wasn't their fault maybe they
44:31
lived in a family where there was a lot
44:32
of abuse and stuff like that
44:34
you can lose all the abuse you
44:36
experienced
44:37
any trauma you have had even if it was
44:39
years ago you can get that out of your
44:41
soul
44:42
if you've gotten angry and said hateful
44:43
things you can cancel those words get
44:45
those words out of your soul
44:47
what you say to other people guess what
44:49
goes in their soul
44:51
but it also goes in yours so when you
44:53
are mean or hateful to people
44:56
or angry or raging you're not just
44:59
hurting those people with your words
45:01
you're actually affecting your own soul
45:04
and i know the father spent
45:05
quite a bit of time uh teaching me all
45:08
this
45:09
with the the reason for that is so we
45:11
can be free
45:12
and i know some people you go to
45:14
counseling for maybe eight months even a
45:16
year
45:16
to get this stuff out of your soul i'm
45:18
not saying you might not need some help
45:20
or counseling
45:21
along the way but you literally can get
45:24
most
45:24
all of it out of your soul by you
45:27
choosing to do that
45:28
what you loose on earth they will loosen
45:31
heaven in other words
45:33
let's say i had a huge trauma maybe i
45:35
saw somebody
45:36
murder that would be a bad thing or i
45:39
was abused i was never abused as a child
45:41
but i know people have been
45:42
beat up with words their whole life
45:44
until they can't think for themselves
45:46
maybe they don't want to know people or
45:48
speak to people uh
45:50
if i wanted to get that that that out of
45:52
my soul
45:53
if i want to get abuse out of myself i
45:55
would say i choose
45:56
i'll explain first and we'll do it as a
45:59
matter of fact can you make us
46:00
can you make us do that as a matter of
46:02
fact can you make us do this yeah
46:04
yeah yeah i always want people to know
46:07
what you were doing
46:08
okay uh i could just have people repeat
46:11
it but i want you to know what happens
46:12
when you do this
46:14
yeah so let's say i had a bad experience
46:16
when i was growing up
46:18
and i experienced something that was
46:20
horrible and i that i keep
46:21
seeing it over and over satan will play
46:24
over and over anything bad that you saw
46:26
or experience he'll make sure because
46:28
you know what it's in
46:29
it's in your soul so he'll play it over
46:31
and over again like a movie
46:32
and you're tired of that so
46:36
this one woman i knew i'd just use her
46:37
an example she was abused by her husband
46:40
many times
46:41
and she grew up still having nightmares
46:44
years later
46:44
they were no longer together she had
46:47
nightmares
46:47
but her children had nightmares because
46:50
they were present when he
46:51
abused her this is what satan wants to
46:54
ruin everybody's life
46:55
she heard about me and so i went to
46:58
speak somewhere and she came and she
46:59
said can you help me
47:00
i had just learned about um the keys to
47:03
the kingdom it's called
47:04
uh it's called a soul checkup and i said
47:07
i can help you and in five minutes
47:09
she said i can't get rid of these
47:11
nightmares and should i stay filled with
47:13
fear even though i'm
47:14
i'm married to somebody who's wonderful
47:16
now and we can talk about marriage later
47:18
if you want to but right now
47:20
she was still having that and so i led
47:23
her in a pr under prayer where she
47:25
loosed
47:25
all of that stuff from her soul uh that
47:28
it wouldn't remain and no longer be
47:30
there in jesus name and when she
47:32
loosed those experiences it was
47:35
gone you know why because when she
47:38
loosed it
47:38
jesus came down and pulled it out of her
47:41
in the bible it says
47:42
jesus is the restorer of our soul
47:46
yeah it does that so jesus literally
47:48
comes and he'll pull all that stuff out
47:50
of your soul
47:51
so it's gone like it never happened
47:55
and that can include any of those things
47:56
i just mentioned and so
47:58
when he did that he came and pulled that
48:01
out of her
48:02
she began to laugh i mean in my car she
48:04
was
48:05
laughing it was like three minutes she
48:07
said it's gone
48:09
i'm so filled with life i'm so happy
48:12
right now
48:13
and when i had gone to speak there
48:15
actually her husband was the pastor he
48:17
went in the store to get a few things
48:19
and the time it took him to go in there
48:21
and get those few things his wife was
48:23
changed when he came back
48:24
out because she was no longer sad or
48:26
oppressed
48:27
and then i had her bind bind the things
48:31
of god
48:31
to her soul so the keys of the kingdom
48:34
what you lose on earth will be loosed in
48:36
heaven
48:36
what you bind on earth will be bound in
48:38
heaven bound like
48:40
to you so then i had a loot of blind bug
48:43
the life of god the love of god the
48:45
presence of god
48:46
she chose to bind them to her soul and
48:49
after that then she was really filled
48:51
with joy so i'm going to lead
48:52
everybody to do that i want you to
48:54
understand you must
48:56
be born again you must have jesus christ
49:00
in you
49:01
to do this because he makes it available
49:04
for us
49:04
right this is something he offers us so
49:07
that our soul guess what
49:09
can prosper so we're going to do this
49:11
together so we have to start all my
49:12
friends i want you all to do this
49:15
yeah i choose i choose
49:19

54:17
much
54:18
well i have many questions i don't know
54:20
uh at what time i need to close
54:22
but if your time is up just let me know
54:24
so that i can just stop questioning you
54:26
and
54:27
you can talk about the plans that god
54:29
has
54:30
over this planet so i have a few more
54:33
minutes but you know we can do this
54:35
again
54:36
yes sure sure sure can you tell me how
54:38
many minutes is it
54:41
about 10 minutes my staff will all be
54:43
here oh
54:44
okay okay so i will ask you some
54:46
important questions so that i don't miss
54:47
out
54:47
and it would be really helpful to all
54:49
the uh believers over here in india
54:52
uh what is the role of uh guardian
54:53
angels and the next question is
54:55
what does the manifested son and
54:56
daughter of god mean
54:58
okay the role of your of the guardian
55:00
angel
55:01
um that angels usually have more than
55:04
one almost everybody has two
55:06
um angels at the time you are conceived
55:10
before you are born your angels are sent
55:13
from heaven
55:14
them so that they can watch over you
55:17
they keep you
55:18
they help to keep you out of trouble
55:21
many times they will save your life and
55:23
you won't even know they saved your life
55:25
so their number one uh reason that
55:28
they're here that god sends them
55:30
it says to guard you and keep you in all
55:32
your ways
55:34
now when we get old enough we can make
55:37
decisions that might
55:38
go against what they want to do right
55:41
we all have a will to choose things
55:43
ourselves but if you are serving god
55:46
and and you're going on his path those
55:49
angels will be with you everywhere
55:50
they literally go with you everywhere
55:52
okay they're waiting for you when you
55:54
wake up
55:55
and uh they go with you all day long
55:57
many places and i know things still
55:59
happen to people sometimes
56:01
but the majority of people their lives
56:04
are kept
56:06
from death from being injured or from
56:08
being harmed
56:09
because of your guardian angel the other
56:12
assignment for your guardian angel is
56:13
when you die
56:15
they are the ones who actually take you
56:18
to heaven
56:19
and so they'll be with you from the day
56:21
you're born they'll stay with you to the
56:23
day you die
56:24
and then they will take you to heaven
56:25
and so that is the main purpose for your
56:28
guardian angels yeah and the manifested
56:30
sons and daughters
56:31
and the armies of heaven what is their
56:33
role
56:34
how do we make use of the host of the
56:36
heavens
56:38
the role of the manifested sons and
56:40
daughters are believers i mean you can't
56:43
manifest who god is if you're not a
56:45
believer right you have to
56:46
receive christ those who have a passion
56:48
to do
56:49
things for god uh those who are willing
56:53
to be obedient i know god asks many
56:56
people to do many different things and
56:58
some say yes some say later
57:00
some say i don't think so it doesn't
57:03
mean you won't go to heaven it's just
57:05
me if you surrender to him
57:08
like it says in the bible to lay down
57:10
your life and find it in christ that
57:12
means you let
57:13
christ guide you personally and he then
57:16
can
57:17
have you give words to people or take
57:20
things to people
57:21
or even to step out and boldly speak at
57:23
different times
57:24
whatever it is he asked you to do the
57:26
more you are willing
57:28
the more he can trust you with but in in
57:31
the book of romans where it talks about
57:33
the earth itself
57:34
this earth is groaning for us to stand
57:37
up
57:38
and take authority over the darkness
57:40
even over the earth
57:42
and and do things that christ tells us
57:44
in that moment to do things
57:46
and i mean those are powerful things
57:49
they're signs and wonders of the
57:51
supernatural
57:52
that most people couldn't ever do
57:54
themselves because it's christ
57:56
in you remember christ in you the hope
57:58
of glory you'll do
57:59
powerful things like at one point people
58:02
will stop a hurricane just stop it let
58:04
christ stop the storm
58:05
uh they'll stop earthquakes they will
58:08
uh they'll not just walk on water other
58:11
people will do more things than that but
58:12
we also know that christ said
58:14
the things i did you will do also that
58:17
means the miracles christ did in the
58:19
bible
58:19
he expects us to step up and begin to do
58:22
these things
58:23
but if you don't just say i'm making
58:26
myself available
58:27
jesus if there's something you need me
58:29
to do i'm willing
58:31
and then when he asks you to do it you
58:33
actually do it
58:34
and to the point where you go um there's
58:36
more kings and priests
58:38
to our god those are levels of authority
58:40
and dominion
58:41
now when you're born again you're going
58:42
to go to heaven but if you're going to
58:44
rule
58:45
an authority in this earth in the spirit
58:48
realm
58:49
like pushing back to darkness uh calling
58:51
those things that be not as though they
58:53
were like one day people will speak and
58:54
there'll be water
58:56
uh all kinds of miracles you'll speak
58:57
and the food will be multiplied
58:59
all those things begin to happen you are
59:01
then demonstrating the power of the
59:04
living god
59:05
not so you look good so people will know
59:08
he exists
59:09
so that's what a manifested son or
59:11
daughter these these are
59:14
my sisters tell me i've got to hurry so
59:15
i got hurt anyway so these are great
59:18
signs and wonders that will be beginning
59:19
to happen in the earth a lot of them
59:21
have not happened yet
59:22
but we're entering into those days where
59:24
people you won't have to ask somebody
59:27
they'll know because these things will
59:28
be taped and sent all over the world
59:30
like like i said you'll stop an
59:32
earthquake it'll stop and you make it
59:34
put it back the way it was before it
59:35
came
59:36
that is what a manifested son or
59:38
daughter would do
59:40
but if you don't step out and say i'll
59:42
go pray for that person god says go pray
59:44
for that person
59:45
who has a broken leg if you don't step
59:47
out and say i'll go in jesus name
59:49
i command your leg to be healed and then
59:52
trust god to do it
59:53
you have to step up with the small
59:55
things and you also have to understand
59:58
this is available as believers
60:01
this is part of our calling to be able
60:03
to do those things but you must seek
60:05
after them
60:06
by seeking after jesus christ first yes
60:09
uh i just have another two questions you
60:11
can just keep them short
60:14
this is the question that most of the
60:16
believers uh you know
60:17
this is a doubt that they have in their
60:19
hearts
60:20
why some christians or believers die
60:23
early
60:24
and uh i mean i i even my sister was
60:27
promoted to glory at a very young age
60:29
like around 23 years old
60:30
and i was in depression for quite a few
60:32
years then after listening to your uh to
60:34
the revelations that god brought forth
60:36
through you then i understood she is in
60:38
the right place and i even had a vision
60:39
you know where i happened to see her
60:41
in the heaven so can you just answer
60:43
this
60:44
yeah oh i've got to hurry really quick
60:46
okay so
60:47
i can't explain why some people go early
60:50
and why some don't go early i do know
60:53
this
60:53
sometimes god has a position in heaven
60:57
like he would put you over the youth or
60:59
he'd put you over
61:00
projects in heaven or even move of god
61:03
come to the earth he'll have
61:04
let you have some responsibility and
61:07
preparing that stuff in heaven for that
61:09
that's a reward that's not a job and so
61:12
because that time comes for that to
61:14
begin to happen
61:16
he will then call those people home to
61:18
heaven
61:19
and so that's his decision they made
61:21
their self available to him
61:23
it's not to make you upset or to hurt
61:25
somebody
61:26
it's just that when we give ourselves to
61:28
christ does that mean we really give
61:30
ourselves to him or do we just want to
61:32
keep ourselves for ourselves
61:34
i i do know that there's things many
61:36
times that's why
61:37
or for whatever reason he has your
61:40
mansion done at a certain time in heaven
61:42
so you can be part of something that is
61:45
going
61:45
on in heaven that's about the best way i
61:47
can explain it
61:48
he never does it to hurt somebody he's
61:51
not trying to make us sad
61:52
but when if you've had someone that has
61:54
lost you need to say
61:56
i choose to release my family number
61:59
into the joy of the lord
62:01
and to their reward in heaven and i lose
62:04
all that grief from my soul
62:06
because if they're with him how can that
62:09
be a sad thing
62:10
as a believer you'll be together through
62:12
all eternity
62:14
and i tell people don't spend all your
62:16
time just
62:17
you know dying and dying and grieving
62:20
when they're in heaven
62:21
enjoying their life being with the lord
62:24
getting to see wonderful things maybe
62:26
he's given them a reward to do something
62:28
in heaven
62:28
they don't want you to grieve on the
62:30
earth okay
62:32
our our lives are sealed in christ
62:35
amen and if you need you can say jesus
62:38
come and bring me peace i receive your
62:41
peace
62:41
and then he will pour peace over you but
62:44
i'm sure that we'll have to do this
62:46
another time because i know
62:48
how hungry people are and i want you to
62:50
know that god
62:51
wants you to have understanding about
62:53
him
62:54
about his son about holy spirit and
62:57
where you will live one day
62:58
this earth is such a short time for us
63:02
and yet how an awesome opportunity we
63:04
have
63:05
to love people for christ to do things
63:08
for him
63:09
it's it's an honor and an opportunity to
63:11
get to share with you and father
63:12
just to bless those people who are
63:14
watching god i
63:16
ask holy spirit to go to them and to
63:19
minister to them to draw even more to
63:22
christ
63:23
i thank you for using these words to
63:26
bring hope
63:27
and joy and even celebration to your
63:30
children
63:31
you need a father you love them you made
63:34
them
63:35
you made them for you i pray they know
63:38
the truth that
63:39
they are free and that they don't miss
63:42
their destiny
63:43
on this earth and that we will all be
63:45
together
63:46
in heaven and in eternity forever we can
63:49
fellowship and get to know one another
63:51
so don't let fear control you don't let
63:54
the enemy control you
63:56
when you love people it's like bashing
63:58
the enemies so when you have a choice to
64:00
love or not love
