03:37
days about our platform that is growing

rapidly
03:40
called zap it spelled x-a-p-i-t is very
03:43
facebook-like
03:44
but we're not going to censor you
03:46
especially we're not going to consider
03:48
sensing your conservative views we're
03:50
not even going to make it our business
03:52
to decide if you're telling a rumor or
03:54
not that's your business
03:55
now what i've found in social media is
03:57
if you're telling a rumor that's a
03:59
completely wild rumor
04:00
the people who are watching you will
04:02
tell you that's a rumor
04:04
they don't need the people at the top
04:06
who run the organization decide what's
04:08
the rumor
04:09
we don't like that and that's one of the
04:10
reasons we're in existence so jeff run
04:12

06:12
said that's accountability on their part
06:14
right hey cat what is that symbol on
06:17
your
06:17
the blue it almost looks like a diamond
06:20
what is that
06:21
this one right here is a shield it's a
06:24
shield representing one from heaven
06:26
this is the host initiative it's about
06:30
heaven's army working with us in this
06:31
time and actually
06:33
god asked me to design a logo and chris
06:36
who's our
06:37
media art tech person helped to create
06:40
this
06:40
and what it is is it says h i the host
06:43
initiative
06:44
the eye is a lightning bolt and on top
06:46
of the eye itself is an
06:48
eye of one of the hosts of heaven and
06:50
behind it is sort of an open portal
06:52
that's what the blue behind it is so
06:54
this represents a new time on the earth
06:57
very cool very very cool well um before
06:59
we let's
07:00
you have an announcement you wanted to
07:02
make about uh this weekend and
07:04
where are you going to be tell us about
07:05
that yeah well everybody
07:08
most people know especially those who
07:10
had signed up for um
07:12
the freedom event the freedom uh
07:15
conference i don't like the conference
07:17
uh freedom event
07:19
of what that was supposed to be in
07:20
murfreesboro tennessee at global fire
07:22
ministries that was cancelled
07:24
because they didn't they really did have
07:26
death threats those death threats have
07:28
been lifted now because
07:30
uh obviously hank uh changed his um
07:34
changed his course so he's not going and
07:36
jeff will not be there at
07:37
all and by the way jeff is on the
07:39
sabbatical i'm just gonna say that much
07:41
right now
07:41
and he probably needs it desperately and
07:44
so does his team
07:45
because of a lot of stuff they've been
07:47
going through however i was invited by
07:49
jan janssen yeah jan
07:52
because god still wanted a message to go
07:54
out through there so i will be
07:55
a special guest speaker this sunday the
07:58
25th
07:59
in murfreesboro tennessee at global fire
08:01
ministries
08:03
it's going to be great it's going to be
08:04
on the times of god
08:06
which is something god just gave me so
08:08
you don't want to miss it
08:09
i'm sure that it will be online if not
08:12
uh i'm sure we at least will have our
08:14
our facebook going with that
08:15
um but just wanted you know global
08:18
foreign ministers is going to go
08:19
uh full steam ahead but jeff is going to
08:23
be taking a sabbatical
08:24
and he probably should have taken that
08:26
six months ago
08:27
if you all didn't know what i'll just
08:29
say this too when the prophets begin to
08:31
jump off the wagon the wagon you know
08:33
that trump's going to be restored
08:35
um a lot of them started bashing him
08:38
which we all know is wrong
08:40
a prophet supposed to speak the words of
08:42
god they're accountable to god himself
08:45
um but no one should bash a prophet you
08:47
know what it says in the bible
08:49
about not touching his anointed so just
08:52
let me give you a heads up that's wrong
08:54
don't bash the prophets hello
08:56
they're the ones who hear from god and
08:58
if they're saying something that doesn't
08:59
line up
09:00
keep it in your heart and pray for them
09:02
but uh but i'm not bashing any of them
09:04
okay
09:05
they made a decision that's between them
09:07
and god we're going to see how all this
09:09
works out in the end
09:10
but if anybody needs a break it would
09:12
definitely be jeff
09:13
and jan and their family and their team
09:17
so i'm going like uh just as uh so that
09:20
you'll still hear a word of god
09:22
that would be powerful from murfreesboro
09:24
tennessee from global fire ministries so
09:26
that's my first announcement i want to
09:27
make
09:28
again that's this sunday and there'll
09:30
just be one service 10 a.m
09:32
sunday and i'm excited about getting to
09:34
go
09:35
and so that's my that's it for that but
09:37
let me tell you what
09:39
yeah go ahead and talk
09:42
you ready to hear about the government
09:44
yeah go go for it yes
09:46
okay well you should probably watch
09:48
hannity the hannity show that president
09:51
trump was actually
09:52
speaking on the other day he gave a few
09:55
heads up about him not being invisible
09:58
anymore
09:59
he's also working full steam ahead to
10:01
get the house flipped
10:03
which we need that to happen if you want
10:05
to pray about something pray that the
10:06
house of representatives gets flipped
10:08
uh back to republican control because we
10:11
need that okay we need it
10:13
the senate's almost a shooting but keep
10:15
praying for that to happen to you
10:17
and those of you who don't know there
10:19
are the elections which
10:20
every four years but there's mid-term
10:23
elections which are very important
10:25
that would be 2022 when a lot of this
10:27
will be voted on
10:28
replacing the voting for the house of
10:31
representatives and for the senate
10:34
there may be a few governorships in
10:35
there somewhere i'm not certain about
10:37
that but i do know
10:38
i do hear down the pipeline but some of
10:41
the governors are going to be more and
10:42
more outspoken the republican ones
10:44
because they have life in their states
10:46
and you should know that if you're in
10:48
one of those i'm in one of those in
10:49
florida
10:50
it's fully open the state's been fully
10:52
opened by governor desantis
10:54
please make sure you're praying for him
10:56
to have more strength and
10:58
and no sound wisdom from god he is a
11:00
strong believer
11:01
and he wants life for the people here
11:03
and there's several other states doing
11:05
the same thing
11:06
so you all you hear from the uh this
11:21
so they're still up to their own
11:23
business they haven't changed their ammo
11:25
at all
11:26
i think one day they will really totally
11:28
regret that because because when the
11:30
news is controlled
11:32
thank god there's other sources newsmax
11:35
and there's a few other sources out
11:37
there i know a
11:38
kenneth copeland show a flashpoint and
11:40
there's several other you don't know
11:42
about
11:43
so you know make sure they're telling
11:44
the truth when you hear them
11:46
because they will encourage you and
11:47
empower you to know what really is going
11:49
on
11:50
i think trump's going to start doing
11:51
that himself and make sure you
11:53
you have checked out is it a 45
11:57
office.com is that what trump's new
12:00
website is i think
12:01
yeah 45 office.com right right 45
12:04
office.com
12:05
sign up for it you'll get stuff from the
12:07
president himself that would be
12:08
president trump
12:10
and so i just want to encourage you
12:11
things many things are going on
12:13
but he's going to be more and more
12:14
visible which terrifies the left and
12:16
terrifies hell
12:18
they don't want his voice to be heard
12:19
there's a frequency in it
12:21
and so he's starting to speak about who
12:23
to vote for
12:25
in these upcoming um midterm elections
12:28
which are very important so please focus
12:31
on that for your prayers
12:32
and of course for trump himself and his
12:34
family
12:35
you're not seeing the end of them trust
12:37
me god's still saying the same exact
12:40
thing
12:40
if you ask me i'm going to keep saying
12:42
the same words he said he's going to
12:44
have his way in this time
12:46
he's going to not just expose the
12:48
corruption but he's going to deal
12:50
harshly with it very harshly with it
12:54
and that's to prepare the way for what
12:56
is coming
12:57
in this next time of god which is not
12:59
the perilous times i know i get tired of
13:01
saying that but people still think it is
13:02
and i saw someone that
13:04
recently asked me that i went absolutely
13:06
not they're from a time when you won't
13:08
even be on the earth people most people
13:09
alive now won't be here when that
13:11
happens you should rejoice about that
13:13
so they'll be great it'll get greater
13:15
and greater and greater and greater
13:17
in the generations to come that's why
13:19
this is being done now
13:21
if you understand how god operated this
13:22
is what he does he wipes out
13:24
exposes the evil hello okay did that in
13:26
heaven
13:27
exposed it then wiped it out of there
13:29
right on the earth
13:30
exposed all the evil with no and then he
13:32
wiped it out and putting over he
13:34
belonged
13:35
he's not going to wipe off the earth
13:36
this time but he's totally going to deal
13:38
with the darkness and
13:40
i know i said eat cake and celebrate yes
13:42
i'm still eating cake in smaller
13:44
portions people
13:46
maybe a cookie would do
13:49
no i don't know a date and guess what
13:51
that doesn't matter to me what matters
13:53
is our god
13:54
is still here you're praying he's got
13:57
your prayers they filled the bowls
13:58
before the altar of his throne
14:00
and yes i've been having many times
14:02
since all this started
14:03
and they're still celebrating so
14:06
celebrate
14:06
but keep your prayer focus out there say
14:09
you may say with your own words
14:11
even in the atmosphere i refuse to
14:13
accept any of the lying cheating
14:15
stealing
14:16
i'm going to accept any a new fake law
14:18
made that takes away my constitutional
14:20
rights i reject it in jesus name
14:23
your words do something in the
14:25
atmosphere to shift things
14:27
so don't think you're powerless you're
14:28
not powerless as long as you've got a
14:30
voice and you've got jesus amen
14:32
very very good by the way this morning
14:33
it is still dark and i get knocked on
14:36
the side
14:37
and i felt like it was an angelic thing
14:39
waking me up and so i thought okay
14:41
i'm going to go back to sleeping i
14:42
thought wait a minute i had reminded
14:44
myself
14:45
when i get knocked i'm supposed to look
14:46
at the clock so i looked at the clock
14:49
the digital this is 4 45 the president
14:51
is 4 45
14:52
this is april i don't know what it means
14:54
i'm just telling you i got
14:56
knocked by an angel look at the clock
14:58
it's 4
14:59
45 so i don't know if the four stands
15:01
for four or april
15:03
probably april maybe but four also means
15:07
you know the number four means god's
15:09
path that's what it means
15:11
god's path uh or god's plans that's what
15:14
the number four means number three means
15:16
god's approval
15:17
so he basically said my path is still 45
15:20
we know who 45
15:21
is yeah absolutely um i'm going to jump
15:24
by the way i was going to mention that
15:26
you said it's april 21 of 21 they've got
15:29
a three for
15:30
because this is your episode 21 with us
15:32
on april 21 of 21. now how's that for
15:35
god in numbers
15:36
that's awesome okay
15:40
but i'm going to jump ahead to a
15:41
question because you just said something
15:42
and i thought i'm going to
15:44
tie that to a question that's way down
15:46
to my list you said
15:48
trump's coming in and they don't like it
15:50
they don't like he's got a different
15:51
vibration
15:52
and i'm going to ask you the question
15:55
then you can jump back to talk about
15:57
i'm going to ask you what did you mean
15:58
by that trump vibration and this world
16:00
inner person said
16:01
there are times when i've come into a
16:03
thick presence of the lord and
16:04
it feels like my back entire body are
16:08
vibrating has this happened even if so
16:10
why are we vibrating so talk about
16:12
vibrating and vibrations
16:14
if they're two different things or
16:15
whatever that's a new question for you
16:19
no i can tell you that happens to me off
16:21
and on
16:22
when the presence of the lord is so
16:24
strong i my body will begin to
16:27
it's like a it's like a super fast
16:30
shaking
16:31
uh i mean we'll shake right and then we
16:33
shake
16:35
your whole inside shakes that's that's
16:37
the frequency of god
16:39
coming into the earth but trump's
16:42
vibration is increasing you're the first
16:45
one who i ever said that you by the way
16:47
that what he's given now is a shaking
16:50
it's a shaking coming from trump himself
16:52
since the enemies trying to
16:54
shake us into fear the words when trump
16:57
speaks him
16:58
has that vibration that frequency of
17:01
of of the spirit of god in them because
17:04
god is shaking himself he's shaking the
17:06
earth itself
17:08
he's starting to shake hell itself is
17:10
shaking right now
17:11
they're terrified because you know
17:13
satan's usually the one who does
17:14
the shaking thing but god had done a
17:17
long
17:18
time ago so he is shaking how the
17:21
spirits of darkness are beginning to
17:22
shake i see them all the time like
17:24
shaking trying to run away
17:26
and so i can tell you we're getting
17:27
closer and closer to that time when god
17:29
himself is going to do something
17:32
of course it's going to involve trump in
17:34
it but even the frequency
17:36
and his voice now has a vibration in it
17:39
some people begin to feel that when they
17:41
hear him speak because you know why he
17:43
is our president
17:46
and i need to remind you when i'm
17:48
talking about this the bible says
17:50
when the wicked are in power you know
17:52
the people is it's going to be a
17:54
terrible time
17:54
people in accuracy all kinds of things
17:56
happen but when that when the righteous
17:58
are in power the people rejoice well why
17:59
aren't you rejoicing
18:01
because the left has no power i don't
18:03
mind saying that
18:04
the left has no power not real power
18:07
they're taking or trying to steal the
18:08
power
18:09
but in the spirit realm they have no
18:11
power to speak
18:13
or bring greater evil and they can want
18:15
to they want to say they want it
18:17
but but because trump is our president
18:19
he is in power
18:21
literally won the election so he's in
18:23
power for that reason but god put him
18:25
there
18:26
and so he is god recognizes him as being
18:29
in power in our country right now even
18:31
though he's not
18:32
that said that officially well he
18:34
actually has said officially he was the
18:35
president
18:36
it's going to shift and when there's a
18:39
shift
18:39
there's a shaking first let me tell you
18:41
but the shaking that's happening in
18:43
spirit right now
18:45
isn't hell shaking it's god shaking
18:49
well that was one of my questions
18:51
somewhere here you just mentioned it
18:54
several prophets have been now saying
18:56
we're in for a bit of a dark time
18:58
before it gets lighter there'll be words
19:00
like that or
19:02
there's going to be riot some riots in
19:04
the cities
19:05
um and maybe some people even need to
19:07
make sure you have
19:08
preparation for a short period and
19:11
before it gets good is someone showing
19:13
you any of that
19:14
and if so or if not no i'm not about
19:17
that
19:18
she's not he's not shown that okay from
19:21
the very beginning when people said we'd
19:23
have civil
19:24
war then they changed some other kind of
19:26
war we'd have neighborhood wars and
19:29
god said the people are not going to
19:30
rise up and have a civil war
19:32
the war is going to be amongst the left
19:34
themselves they're going to start
19:35
fighting themselves and god says it also
19:38
but i can tell you
19:39
we are not appointed under wrath and
19:42
because this is
19:43
not the day of his wrath that's god's
19:45
wrath
19:46
it's not the day of god's wrath that
19:48
means anyone who rises up trying to do
19:49
something
19:50
they're going to get the wrath of god is
19:52
what's going to happen
19:53
and i would say anything like that would
19:55
be uh i don't i don't know if god has
19:57
never said to me
19:58
that they need to be prepared for months
20:00
and months and months of total darkness
20:02
no food no i think and i think most
20:04
people think
20:05
think in the terms of a week or two or
20:07
something like that that there'd be
20:09
some intense times you're not getting
20:11
anything like that
20:12
i'll tell you where they won't come from
20:14
they won't come from the republican
20:17
[Laughter]
20:19
any of states happens you people need to
20:21
know
20:23
if the democrats are in control of the
20:26
states and there's democratic governors
20:27
and we all know about newsome and the
20:29
other one
20:29
i can't remember his name most of the
20:31
time the one in the old california that
20:33
they've tried to get rid of like eight
20:35
times and he
20:36
keeps getting around it i can't speak
20:39
for those states
20:40
because there has been some violence in
20:42
those states
20:43
that has nothing to do with our our own
20:46
president that has nothing to do with
20:48
america itself that's not america
20:51
going into war thus those governors
20:53
permitting and probably paying for
20:56
those different groups to come in and do
20:58
demonstrations of violence and set
21:00
things on fire
21:01
why to bring fear to the people
21:04
that's what that's all about but as far
21:06
as our whole country that's not going to
21:09
happen
21:10
the governors who are in power right now
21:12
and the republican governors aren't
21:13
going to tolerate it happening
21:15
they will stop that from happening
21:17
they've already had meetings about that
21:19
and information has already been sent
21:21
out this kind of covert information
21:24
i can assure you the only ones who will
21:26
keep doing it are the ones who are doing
21:27
it
21:29
good good good good okay uh we've got
21:31
various things okay here's a person
21:33
wanting to know
21:34
uh when jesus was in heaven he or she
21:37
stayed he or she saying jesus was in
21:39
heaven
21:40
until he was in mary's womb so suddenly
21:42
he's in mary's womb
21:44
do you have any knowledge about was he
21:47
the question is that was he able to
21:48
communicate with god
21:50
while he's in the womb during those nine
21:52
months i guess is the question
21:56
i know uh quite a bit about how all that
21:59
happened
22:00
but um the one thing i want to say now
22:02
before we get off the track is
22:04
right side broadcasting is another place
22:07
you can go
22:08
to online is that right now let me see
22:11
uh
22:12
oh i can't forget to say this this last
22:16
sunday
22:17
they had a huge event in florida called
22:20
storm the bay
22:21
trumperilla mega first boat parade in
22:24
tampa florida
22:26
hundreds of thousands of people flooded
22:28
the state
22:29
to celebrate trump and right side
22:31
broadcasting if you go on and look for
22:33
it
22:34
you'll be able to see it and right side
22:36
broadcasting is the one who's always
22:37
showing him now when he has any kind of
22:40
um rallies and stuff like that right
22:42
side broadcasting we'll be putting that
22:44
on so don't forget to go there and check
22:46
it out you'll be blessed beyond measure
22:47
to see
22:49
i'm sure trump was and mike lindell yay
22:52
michael
22:58
he literally paid for that whole thing
23:00
to happen
23:01
and so i want to tell you bless mike
23:03
glendale go buy his pillow my pillow
23:08
really a true patriot absolutely
23:12
okay back to the womb thing what jesus
23:14
going in from
23:15
so i obviously at one moment he's in
23:18
heaven
23:19
then there's the the seed in mary's womb
23:22
suddenly
23:27
i have to let you know it was not
23:30
a suddenly in heaven okay this was
23:34
planned
23:35
our father is the greatest planner of
23:38
all time he makes claims
23:40
to be clear i think this person knew
23:43
that
23:44
but realized that there was a moment in
23:46
time
23:47
when it happened when the plan was put
23:50
into effect
23:51
so he's there the plan is about to
23:53
happen the angel sees mary
23:55
it says the spirit's going to overshadow
23:57
you and whom
23:58
it happens right what do you do and that
24:01
was actually that was gabriel gabriel
24:04
uh was present however
24:08
the holy spirit is the one who brought
24:11
the his name was the word that was
24:13
jesus's name in heaven he was called the
24:15
word the father explained to him if
24:17
you're going to die for them i have to
24:18
put flesh on you turn you into a seed
24:20
and holy spirit will plant you in the
24:23
womb of
24:24
mary so holy spirit came in the form of
24:27
a seed
24:28
and gabriel was there also so when that
24:30
happened gabriel
24:32
got to make the announcement that's why
24:34
that's why gabriel was there to let mary
24:35
know how all that happened
24:37
and i don't know maybe in the beginning
24:39
i'm sure the father was watching over
24:41
him and everything
24:42
but there came a time jesus when he was
24:44
born
24:45
he had to be raised up till he came to a
24:47
time of understanding which was young
24:49
he was young when he knew he was the son
24:51
of god
24:52
but in the womb of mary i believe he was
24:55
like any other baby in there
24:56
he had to grow his body had to form
25:00
uh into the into the the flesh body that
25:02
god had chosen for him
25:05
and so i'm sure the father probably
25:07
saying over him and things like that but
25:08
as far as communication like speaking to
25:11
him
25:11
i don't know that happened until jesus
25:14
got older when the father
25:15
literally wanted him to know you are my
25:18
son
25:18
you must be about my business this is
25:20
why i sent you
25:22
yeah that's good that's good now this
25:24
person wants to know a different person
25:26
wants to know
25:27
jesus is on the man of transfiguration
25:29
and either the father brings it
25:31
says it but most this and elijah i'm
25:34
guessing they were in
25:35
abraham's wisdom then suddenly are
25:37
whisked uh
25:38
for lack of better terrible knowledge
25:40
they're on the mount with jesus
25:42
uh and this person's wanting to know
25:45
what did they talk about if you know
25:47
and did they do some sort of time travel
25:49
to understand what was going on what
25:51
what can you tell me about any details
25:53
about that event
25:55
are you talking about when the disciples
25:56
saw him right yeah
25:58
right they saw moses and elijah and
26:00
they're all talking
26:01
this person wasn't what were they
26:03
talking about
26:05
and then she actually he or she asked
26:07
did they try and travel
26:09
at that moment i think because there has
26:11
been teaching i think kim clement
26:13
suggested this others have suggested
26:15
that there was a time travel element
26:17
when moses was on mount sinai and god
26:20
hit him in the cleft of the rock
26:22
and there was a suggestion they time
26:24
traveled into the amount of
26:26
transfiguration
26:27
hundreds and hundreds of years in the
26:29
future what you thought i think
26:31
that probably could have been a whole
26:32
different incident
26:34
um i'm sure of course jesus christ by
26:37
the way
26:37
appeared when the monk of
26:38
transfiguration was they saw him in his
26:40
glorified body that's what they did
26:43
so so at one moment he's in his body his
26:45
human body that you would normally see
26:47
but when he when christ was glorified
26:49
when he came out of the tomb there was
26:50
such a glory on him remember
26:52
even a few people didn't recognize him
26:54
at that time so in front of them
26:57
they saw christ in the glorified body he
26:59
allowed
27:00
it probably could have been an open
27:02
vision he probably could have done an
27:04
open vision thing
27:05
where they saw you know they saw them
27:08
with him up there they saw him
27:10
it was just evidence to them he was the
27:12
son of god and that that was right what
27:14
they were
27:15
they were thinking at the time in their
27:16
life i do know this that when
27:18
moses when god put moses in the cleft of
27:21
the rock
27:21
god himself put moses inside him the
27:24
cleft of the rock was inside god
27:27
and all of time is con is uh shown in
27:30
there
27:30
god's been from the beginning to the end
27:32
the end of the beginning it's all
27:33
inside him so when he hit he hid
27:37
moses in there moses saw time begin
27:40
he saw the garden of eden he saw adam
27:44
he saw that he would not have known
27:46
about any of that and so he said as
27:48
i pass by when time passes by i said
27:51
when
27:51
that's what he's saying i will show you
27:53
the hinder parts that's the exact
27:55
oh that's what that means wasn't the
27:58
hunter parts wasn't god
27:59
talking about his back the hinder parts
28:02
were the parts of
28:03
time that had gone before them
28:06
he showed moses time before that time
28:09
and that's how moses knew about adam and
28:12
eve and all that stuff so that was a
28:14
whole different encounter that moses had
28:16
with god
28:17
that was a brand new encounter when when
28:19
jesus was shown
28:20
in his glorified body in the amount of
28:22
transfiguration he could have
28:24
totally brought moses and you know right
28:27
there he could have just put him there
28:28
with them
28:29
because you know he is god so there's
28:31
many different
28:32
facets i guess one day we're just gonna
28:34
we're going to not right now
28:35
eventually write a revelation bible or
28:38
bible of revelation however you want to
28:39
call it probably
28:41
and put all these scriptures in there
28:43
with with the encounters that happen
28:45
time travel that happened the spirit
28:47
realm so people are beginning to
28:49
understand there's things we don't see
28:51
or understand that are hidden in the
28:53
word of god
28:54
yeah wow okay awesome that's i i never
28:57
heard that explanation the hindu part
28:59
means in history basically it was what
29:01
awesome i always wondered where moses
29:03
got his revelation about the garden of
29:05
eden that's what you're saying
29:06
that's where it happened because he
29:08
wrote those books okay
29:09
so um three different people you know we
29:12
went through this
29:13
last time but i don't think we kept
29:15
these names
29:16
you may have to remind me people this
29:18
will tell people something about god was
29:20
king who killed his brother
29:22
is he in heaven if he knows nicodemus
29:24
who jesus said you have to be born again
29:26
again is he in heaven and what about a
29:29
massive fire who lied to the holy spirit
29:31
and died are they in heaven if you know
29:35
now i you need to say them over again
29:38
because i know okay
29:39
yeah okay so cain who killed his brother
29:43
nicodemus and ananias and sapphira
29:49
i have never seen ananias and sapphira
29:52
anywhere in heaven
29:53
i've not seen them at all cain is there
29:57
because cain
29:58
did eventually repent cain knew that he
30:01
had sinned but this is the thing
30:03
he knew god protected him he knew he
30:05
would have been killed and this is the
30:07
thing
30:07
why did god still want him even on the
30:09
earth well number one he was still
30:11
he still was producing children that was
30:14
in the lineage of
30:15
um of adam
30:19
for some time so god wanted him to
30:21
remain
30:22
or he would not have marked him so
30:23
people wouldn't kill him god didn't
30:25
allow him to be killed
30:26
that mean he had a time for him to take
30:29
adam when
30:29
and not adam when cain died that he went
30:32
to abraham's bosom so yes
30:34
he did repent unlike judas who never
30:37
repented judas is in hell
30:39
completely and nicodemus i'm almost
30:42
probably pretty certain that he's so
30:44
was passionate about god himself about
30:48
him
30:49
he most likely is in heaven so the only
30:51
ones i'm pretty sure are not are in
30:53
ice and sapphira who lied that was that
30:56
was life blasting
30:57
the holy spirit really rejecting
30:59
knowingly
31:00
knowing the truth and lying to the face
31:03
of the
31:04
those who are in authority lied to them
31:06
that was not a good thing to do
31:08
on on god said never is a good thing to
31:10
do but back then
31:12
it was like they they were not in heaven
31:15
i'm not seeing them in him i've
31:16
seen adam and eve in heaven for sure
31:21
yeah that that reminds me pull it up um
31:24
i may have to come back to it
31:26
someone wrote me a question this morning
31:27
i'm not sure which one of my notes but
31:29
they said if somebody's saved
31:31
and then towards the end of their life
31:33
they got into idol worship
31:35
um and then they they didn't give the
31:38
conclusion
31:39
they said at the end of the life they
31:40
started worshiping idols it must be a
31:41
personal
31:42
thing are they lost forever is there
31:44
some chance that that person
31:46
that accepted christ will still make it
31:48
but they've lost rewards what what could
31:50
you say about that
31:51
i would have more details of the
31:53
question i would say i'm not god
31:55
right well none of us are god and that
31:57
only god knows the heart of a person
32:00
and uh so there's no explanation about
32:03
how did they get pulled into that how
32:05
deep was that
32:06
was that our artificial thing was that
32:08
that was like was that could it be in
32:10
any kind of idol was that like money or
32:13
gold or was that like
32:15
in um like idol worship as far as um
32:18
um you know
32:23
yeah so i would say if they're a
32:25
believer and we're pulled off the track
32:28
for that but never denied jesus christ
32:32
i would say there's definitely still a
32:33
really good chance that they're in
32:34
heaven
32:35
because at that time of their death
32:37
christ would probably
32:39
meet with them if they had a christian
32:41
family
32:42
or close close christian friends praying
32:44
for them that absolutely gave
32:46
but i can't say there's so many
32:49
different ways that it could be idol
32:51
worship okay
32:52
if it was just like idolized if it's
32:55
idolizing
32:56
things like material things that doesn't
32:59
send you to hell just means you're going
33:01
to be a weak christian so there's a lot
33:02
of
33:03
um leeway and all of that but i would
33:06
say
33:06
god this is what he says if i got you if
33:09
you became
33:10
born again i have a hook in you okay he
33:12
puts a hook in you
33:14
that christ will pursue that even up
33:16
until
33:17
the time that you die he's going to
33:19
pursue that because there's those words
33:21
you spoke yourself receiving him it says
33:24
he's married to the backslider so i can
33:26
just keep giving you scripture all day
33:28
long
33:28
he desires that none should perish and
33:31
if you already gave that declaration
33:32
that is a
33:33
powerful powerful thing when you receive
33:35
christ
33:36
he doesn't just wipe you off the books
33:38
because you fall once or twice you get
33:40
caught
33:40
into something that's different than
33:42
giving your whole life and signing a
33:44
satanic agreement with satan
33:47
wow yeah by the way back on the
33:51
anonymous sapphire thing
33:52
let me let me drill down just a bit on
33:54
that i've got this question swirly in my
33:56
brain
33:57
uh we see it as a momentary event
34:00
where where almost as if a few minutes
34:04
before he they decided to talk they did
34:05
they they decided to lie
34:08
do you see ananias and sapphira as half
34:12
having a really character and honesty
34:15
flaw that was working in them for quite
34:17
a while for them to be able to do this
34:19
in other words
34:20
they didn't make a momentary decision
34:22
and spending eternity in hell for that
34:24
or
34:25
were they really pretenders all along do
34:28
you have any other insights on
34:30
i think that is long-standing sin
34:34
i would have to say that was probably
34:36
something that they had been
34:37
um involved in for some time
34:41
that i think they already had um
34:44
made their decision before they were
34:46
asked that even though and they do this
34:48
definitely and they said the same thing
34:50
they both had a chance to say
34:52
separately uh here wrong we've done this
34:55
neither one of them did it we showed you
34:57
that right there there was coercion they
34:59
did it
34:59
they made an agreement this is what
35:01
we're going to say infrastructure we're
35:03
not backing off with this this is what
35:05
we're saying even though it's a lie
35:07
and i have to say that's exactly what
35:09
happened because otherwise
35:10
one of them could have been moved if
35:12
they weren't together
35:13
they had an opportunity to say no we
35:15
lied about it we lied we should have
35:17
told the truth
35:18
they could have at either time having
35:20
done this separately
35:22
had the freedom to say we're lying
35:25
and we're cheating god and they didn't
35:27
do it
35:29
they cheated they lied
35:33
so that was already working in their
35:35
home
35:37
an agreement it makes sense that it was
35:42
yeah because you'd have to get to a
35:43
point in your life where you're willing
35:44
to take that chance
35:45
that i must have kept blessing you no
35:47
matter what you did so you thought you
35:49
could get away with it
35:50
this was inspiring yeah it says okay um
35:53
now
35:54
people will look at cat with pink hair
35:56
multiple visions
35:57
and trips to heaven and they think every
36:00
single prayer gets
36:01
answered for you right away so here's
36:03
the question does cat have
36:04
all or most of her prayers answered
36:06
instantly does she have any prayers that
36:09
are still in process of being answered
36:11
what is the longest prayer she has ever
36:13
prayed and still waiting for the answer
36:17
i have to say the longest one that i
36:19
stood
36:20
and i would have to say i didn't keep
36:21
saying it
36:23
i don't i don't once i ask god something
36:26
if i even
36:26
ask him it's almost never that i ask him
36:30
for something
36:31
not for me it's usually for others that
36:34
i stand in the gap for
36:35
and i would have to say i knew that i
36:38
knew my family was called to do
36:40
something
36:41
and i was probably 14 years old um
36:44
maybe younger than that and my own dad
36:48
my my physical dad had conversations
36:50
with me about our family and what would
36:51
be called
36:52
into and there'd be signs that would
36:53
begin to happen and we would see those
36:55
signs
36:56
and so we my dad and i prayed together
36:58
about this we actually stood in the
37:00
mountains somewhere and like
37:01
this it was very powerful declaration
37:04
and prayer and agreement
37:06
i never dropped it even when my dad went
37:08
to heaven that didn't change anything
37:09
that we were standing for i was standing
37:10
for his intergenerational thing
37:12
and that was probably close to 40 some
37:14
years and it and it happened it began to
37:16
happen the same signs he said what
37:18
happened would happen
37:19
and i rejoice in sin so that declaration
37:23
and decree and agreement that agreement
37:25
has already happened
37:26
so i don't usually ask god just brings
37:29
stuff to me all the time and it's like
37:31
literally i hear him every day and yes
37:33
that's because i have a commission
37:34
that doesn't mean you can't hear him
37:36
every day if you pursue him for that
37:38
but he actually came from heaven and
37:39
said i'm giving you a commission to be
37:41
taken to heaven when i feel like it
37:43
that's god
37:44
to show you things to reveal on the
37:46
earth i'm going to show you things to
37:47
come i'm going to take you to the past
37:48
and show you things how they happen
37:50
and giving you revelation on the word of
37:52
god and it was for one reason that they
37:54
would know him and know that heaven was
37:56
real
37:56
so i don't have a lot of things i
37:59
personally even
38:00
asked for myself because i'm living
38:04
in what his plan is and this is a thing
38:06
i haven't backed up
38:08
i'm not going to back up i won't change
38:10
what he's saying to me
38:11
i'm allowed to say what he says and i'm
38:14
allowed to tell you what he
38:15
showed me so i don't have the mix of man
38:18
in me i don't have man's plans man's
38:21
thoughts man's assumptions
38:22
and i don't listen to most anything out
38:24
there i listen to him
38:26
and and that's good to have a time to
38:29
give to him
38:30
and even though people say stuff if it
38:32
comes against what he said to you
38:33
i would not receive it if it's against
38:36
what god himself said to you and that's
38:37
where a lot of people think well all
38:39
these other people are believing this
38:40
maybe i should believe that no
38:42
you believe what god said to you so most
38:45
of my prayers like i've stood for over
38:46
40 some years for that to happen
38:48
never failing to thank him for it which
38:51
is the key
38:52
he told me god confirmed it that this
38:55
was going to happen
38:56
and i've only thanked him all those
38:58
years for the promise he gave to us
39:03
what that's going to do so let me ask
39:05
you this is me adding to the question
39:07
so there must be four or five people you
39:10
could
39:10
you could think of
39:16
who you have asked god for their
39:18
salvation
39:22
would that be true people that you stood
39:25
for they've asked for their salvation
39:27
but you see nothing happen
39:31
i don't know about that because i see
39:34
the spirit of god
39:36
look around the person drawing them and
39:38
pulling them
39:39
i have to say it wasn't very long if it
39:41
was somebody
39:42
i personally knew that i stood for it
39:45
wasn't very long before they came to
39:46
christ
39:47
and most of these people probably
39:49
belonged to him and were beginning to
39:51
wander
39:52
and i would send the host of podenon
39:54
strongholds of satan trying to influence
39:55
that people was the worst thing i did
39:57
to stop the enemy from continuing to
39:59
speak to them there's so many things we
40:01
have the right as a believer to do
40:03
so those things were pulled down that
40:05
left them open to hear the spirit of god
40:08
the body of christ needs to know you
40:10
need to know who you are and just
40:12
using the word what it says about your
40:14
word you speak
40:16
but then you can't use the same words to
40:18
you can't bless and curse okay i
40:20
bless i choose not to curse you bless
40:23
them don't
40:24
curse them because then you're powerful
40:26
the more your words are pure when you
40:28
speak
40:29
the more things the quickly the more
40:30
quicker things happen
40:32
so i can't equate myself and he won't
40:35
let me
40:36
line myself up with how he does with
40:37
other people because i live
40:39
a different kind of life myself but i
40:42
always tell people
40:43
never give up that is the thing don't
40:45
step back
40:46
don't get caught in fear don't get
40:49
caught in deception
40:51
because there's a lot of deception going
40:52
on right now make sure you're staying
40:54
true to what god said
40:55
read his word meditate and you know what
40:58
that means
40:58
ask him a question if you see something
41:00
just outwardly say
41:02
i would like to know what that means and
41:04
i can tell you whatever i said
41:06
that to him he would always give me
41:08
revelation it might be a
41:10
maybe a couple days later or i would
41:12
actually hear someone
41:13
say the very thing i had asked god not
41:15
knowing
41:16
and they would say this is what i
41:18
believe it is i would say to me that's
41:20
the answer
41:21
so it's it's keeping your own ears open
41:24
by not playing darkness is the biggest
41:27
thing you cannot play with darkness you
41:28
can't play in the camp of the enemy
41:30
and expect to hear clearly in your life
41:33
and the other thing is if you have fear
41:35
which the enemy uses again you kick fear
41:37
all i don't care if you have to do it
41:38
all day kick
41:39
fear out of your soul get out of your
41:41
house because that
41:43
what happens is it begins to stop you
41:45
from hearing clearly
41:47
but i can't line myself up he won't let
41:49
me say well you're doing this but
41:50
they're not or they're not able to do
41:52
this because you can do it
41:53
uh whatever he gives me to do the number
41:56
two thing i would say is keep your
41:57
hearing open is to obey
42:00
obey what god is saying i have to live
42:03
i live in life you just
42:06
absolutely now you just intrigued me by
42:09
because uh
42:10
again i've known you for seven years i
42:12
know you as the probably the
42:14
most obedient person i know and you've
42:17
been caught up to heaven thousands of
42:18
times
42:19
and he walks through your
42:23
wall a day or two and then give it
42:27
to you through someone else's voice
42:29
who's just talking that's what you just
42:31
said is that
42:32
is that right it is right because
42:36
it's usually somebody that i know and i
42:38
think god
42:39
is showing me uh anyone can
42:42
hear if you ask it sincerely and you ask
42:45
him
42:46
in believing that he's going to reveal
42:48
this is about the word of god mostly
42:50
that i'll say why did this happen i
42:52
wonder why that happened i'm not even
42:54
necessarily saying that him i'm just
42:55
saying it
42:57
and then maybe a couple days later gem
42:58
will say well i believe this and this
43:00
was it
43:01
this i think this is how this happened
43:02
her not knowing that i even said that
43:04
out loud
43:05
and so but many times he'll use the
43:07
people close to you if there's strong
43:09
christians he'll
43:10
because maybe he's saying that to them
43:12
at the same time
43:14
but but mostly he just speaks to me and
43:16
most of the stuff
43:17
that i get is what he says to me just
43:20
like he was speaking to me this morning
43:22
when i woke up
43:23
he was speaking to me last night when i
43:25
went to bed and he was speaking to me
43:26
for several hours yesterday
43:28
it's a lifestyle
43:34
interesting okay this questions i've
43:36
heard this before so i i
43:38
think i know your answer but on on the
43:42
on this earth created actual wine jesus
43:45
drank
43:46
actual wine in heaven is their wine and
43:49
if so what is it like
43:51
sorry i'm going to interrupt really
43:52
quick steve you're cutting out
43:54
everything you're going to
43:55
keep freezing here a little bit yeah
43:57
let's see jeff are you coming in
43:59
yeah so steve i'm going to keep it so
44:02
yeah i'm going to kick you out really
44:03
quickly
44:06
yeah you're breaking up and freezing
44:09
right but okay i'll come back here
44:11
okay here we go cat go ahead and just
44:13
answer that question is there wine in
44:15
heaven
44:16
oh there's wine in heaven but there's no
44:20
alcohol people
44:21
because nothing can decay you know they
44:24
use that whole process
44:25
i believe i don't i don't drink myself
44:27
but the wine christ
44:29
drank was heaven's wine at the wedding
44:33
when he made the water into wine that
44:35
wasn't earth's wine that was heaven's
44:37
wine when he spoke it was the first
44:39
miracle he did
44:40
was at a wedding and mary knew he could
44:43
do it because guess what he did it in
44:45
their home
44:45
he made their water into wine heaven's
44:47
wine all the time
44:49
and in the bible when the people got the
44:50
wine in the web and he said
44:52
normally they give the best one the
44:54
beginning of the wedding that's what the
44:55
guy who was
44:56
having the one thing sad to jesus and he
44:58
said but you have given the best
45:01
at the end and usually they gave the
45:03
worst wine they had but this one is the
45:04
best we've ever had
45:06
the reason for that is what jesus made
45:08
was heaven's wine
45:10
and it was being drunk on earth for the
45:12
first time so jesus every time he took a
45:14
cup
45:15
didn't matter where he was he would just
45:17
release into it and it would turn it
45:19
into heaven's wine
45:22
but there's wine in heaven yes it's
45:23
filled with the holy spirit
45:27
okay now jeff my eye because
45:30
since that was me i can't tell i see on
45:33
my screen
45:34
so oh uh can you hear me all right cat
45:38
oh i can hear you fine yeah there's a
45:40
little delay
45:44
on your end steve
45:50
did everybody hear the answer to the
45:51
question i think everybody heard
45:54
and here comes joe i don't see anybody's
45:56
video but
45:57
okay what's going on um
46:02
steve i think it's it's on your end
46:04
there's a little bit of a
46:06
so this is what we're gonna do i got a
46:07
couple of questions picked out
46:09
as well so steve if you want
46:12
is there a way you can reset your router
46:16
i just did before the show okay i i did
46:20
a whole
46:20
cold woo yeah so what if i try to get
46:28
on my hot spot yeah go ahead and try
46:31
that
46:32
yeah yes
46:35
okay let me try and get in my iphone
46:38
okay
46:39
okay so i'm gonna kick him out cat
46:43
i'm gonna ask a question okay i am a
46:46
huge
46:47
superman fan like massive okay and yes i
46:50
know people everybody's saying i look
46:51
like clark can i don't do it on purpose
46:54
i just do and i have to wear glasses i'm
46:56
sorry
46:57
i'm not apologizing for it i don't
46:59
apologize okay
47:00
so my question is i've heard you say
47:03
this before
47:04
touch on this i'm going to ask
47:07
can you fly in heaven yes
47:14
you can fly you can fly in heaven number
47:16
one why wouldn't you
47:18
which is what the holy spirit says to me
47:19
all the time why wouldn't you fly
47:21
i mean it's the place of creation
47:24
it's the life and the power of god is
47:26
everywhere if plants can sing
47:29
if you can travel on light in heaven if
47:32
you can speak and create
47:33
food and it's on a tray in front of you
47:36
why wouldn't you be able to fly
47:38
and there is a park there's an amusement
47:40
park i was taken to that
47:41
have evidence that i was taken to that
47:43
in my book one
47:45
it really exists they have a place
47:47
called flyby that's one of the amusement
47:49
things in heaven in their park
47:51
and you get taught to fly there and your
47:54
friends who are in heaven will come to
47:56
watch you learn to fly
47:58
because it is hilarious you're not
48:00
really good in the beginning you're like
48:02
spinning through the air i mean you
48:04
actually have places for them to sit and
48:05
watch
48:06
you learn but the the point is this
48:08
christopher reeves who
48:10
made it to heaven it's what he gets to
48:13
do
48:14
in heaven and i hope i just bashed a
48:16
bunch of liberal uh
48:17
not liberal but judgmental people keep
48:19
it to yourself you'll find out when you
48:21
go though you'll be standing in line
48:22
with everyone else
48:23
waiting to learn
48:29
that sounds amazing what about super
48:31
strength can you like lift
48:33
super heavy things well you know nothing
48:35
really weighs much in heaven it's made
48:37
out of light but it is substantial like
48:40
the walls of your mansion and heaven
48:41
don't try to run through them
48:43
a portal would open you would run
48:45
through the portal and the wall of your
48:46
mansion but it's a real place in your
48:49
spiritual body in the spiritual world
48:51
you feel the ground you're walking on
48:53
you feel the food that you're eating it
48:55
and so i would imagine since this is one
48:58
of the best things i've talked about
49:00
very little they actually have the angel
49:02
games
49:03
not kidding at all they actually have
49:06
what we call the olympics they call the
49:08
angel games in heaven
49:10
and the army of heaven put them on on a
49:12
regular basis when they come back from a
49:14
lot of
49:15
warring they get to do the angel games
49:17
and show how good they are the different
49:19
supernatural things they do so you'll
49:21
probably be there watching that
49:22
yeah oh yeah steve
49:25
steve hello
49:34
a little bit
49:50
people get to witness any you know
49:52
children
49:53
leaving did you say
49:57
aliens
50:01
did you hear what you said i did not i
50:04
didn't hear what he said
50:06
steve okay i'm going to try one
50:09
placement i'm going to try
50:19
[Music]
50:21
he sounds like a computer yeah you sound
50:24
like your
50:24
part computer steve
50:30
now i think he may have said have i been
50:32
present when people
50:34
went went to heaven from earth he may
50:37
have said that i'm not sure can you hear
50:38

50:41
yeah he's like completely frozen why
50:43
don't you just answer that
50:44
have you seen that i can and just
50:47
recently did actually
50:49
that happens several ways if i am
50:51
present and somebody passes uh i've been
50:54
present
50:55
several times sometimes family members
50:57
sometimes friends
50:59
one of the most recent ones is my
51:00
husband's best friend who he spent
51:02
time with a lot right before he passed
51:04
and we were actually in
51:06
um uh we were in icu in his room
51:10
and the guy who was there to watch over
51:12
him until he passed was undone that we
51:14
came in to see him i came right from an
51:16
event
51:17
from the airport to see him because the
51:18
holy spirit said he's not going to be
51:19
there long
51:22
so we go in his room and i began to call
51:24
our daughters who
51:26
he's he loved our daughters very much as
51:27
my husband best friend
51:29
and they got to say goodbye to him i
51:31
held the phone up to his ear and they
51:32
each got to say goodbye
51:34
and after the second one did that i told
51:36
this um
51:37
the intern who was in his room i said
51:39
he's going to go really quick and he
51:40
said oh he's going to last all night i
51:42
said no he's not
51:43
his own angels are pacing back and forth
51:45
and i said
51:46
that means the other angels are going to
51:48
come because they all go
51:50
together when they leave and i said
51:51
they'll rush in the room and take them
51:53
with this guy's eyes just kept getting
51:54
bigger and bigger whenever i would talk
51:56
about
51:57
you know that type of thing and i said
51:59
my last daughter we got a hold of her
52:01
and she got to say goodbye to him on the
52:03
phone and when we
52:04
when we hung up our cell phone these
52:07
eight angels
52:08
raced in the room and i told the guy the
52:10
angels have raced in the room
52:12
here right now he was watching his
52:14
screen you know his screen that says his
52:16
heartbeat is still going
52:18
and they took him and his angel they all
52:20
went out to the ceiling
52:21
took his spiritual body and left and all
52:23
of a sudden that goes
52:27
and that guy goes i can't believe this
52:29
he was so shocked when he said
52:31
he checked he said he is gone i went
52:33
yeah i told you they came to take him so
52:36
that's what usually happens
52:40
so it was quite got it quite like the
52:42
guy the guy really got undone that
52:44
that god actually does that so
52:46
absolutely powerful steve hi
52:49
hi if you can hear me i'll try and do
52:51
that one question again and if i go out
52:53
again i'll just have you wrap things up
52:55
jeff if i go out again but
52:57
uh the question that i had that this
52:59
person had is
53:00
with the with uh all the children that
53:03
the lord sends to the earth the father
53:05
says are in
53:06
him literally he sends them to the earth
53:09
throughout our calendar day if you will
53:11
this person wants to know
53:13
anyone in heaven see this activity of
53:15
him sending children do they see
53:17
children go going anything like that
53:22
well they may see them leaving him but
53:24
the way that actually happens is still
53:27
his holy spirit who's involved in the
53:28
holy spirit
53:30
takes a little spirit of life some can
53:32
be very tiny and if you can see my
53:34
fingers or not they can be this small
53:36
they're different sizes we're different
53:39
sizes here
53:40
it's their spiritual body and what
53:42
happens is at the time of conception
53:45
the father releases into his hand that
53:48
little spirit of life the holy spirit
53:49
takes that
53:50
goes down to the earth into the womb of
53:52
the mother
53:54
into her and at the very time of
53:56
conception
53:57
the holy spirit knits and attaches that
54:00
little spirit of life to that
54:02
dot of flesh that's exactly there's a
54:04
flash of light when that happens because
54:07
your little spirit means made out of
54:09
light so when he attaches it literally
54:11
to that
54:12
inside the mother there's a flash of
54:14
light and that little spirit of life at
54:16
that time
54:17
begins to grow in the womb of its mother
54:20
and i tell people i said that for years
54:22
and all of a sudden in
54:24
science they actually discovered
54:26
themselves
54:27
that at the time of conception and they
54:29
can't explain it they actually announced
54:32
we know now that life begins at
54:34
conception because at the time of
54:36
conception when it
54:37
literally takes place there's a flash of
54:39
light and we don't know what that is
54:41
it's that little spirit of life of that
54:44
person
54:44
that baby being attached at that very
54:46
moment on the earth
54:50
so i think people in heaven already know
54:52
that's going to happen if they're
54:53
believing
54:54
and they're watching their family
54:55
members praying god i i would we would
54:57
like to have a child my husband ivan
54:59
that happened a lot
55:01
and so they may go before the zone and
55:02
say father are you going to send them
55:04
a baby are you going to send them one
55:06
and sometimes he'll answer them he may
55:08
say
55:08
it may be a year or earth year go by or
55:11
whatever but yes that is my desire to
55:13
send one to them to raise up to become
55:16
somebody for him so yeah they kind of
55:19
know people
55:20
in heaven already know that this is
55:22
going to happen on the earth
55:23
but as far as being present i don't
55:25
think that happens
55:26
unless they see when the little one
55:28
steps out in his hand
55:30
because i remember myself being in the
55:32
hand of god
55:33
and him speaking to me
55:36
and every now and then somebody will
55:38
tell me years ago i had these dreams
55:41
of me sitting in the hand of god as a
55:42
little tiny
55:44
being is that true does that happen and
55:46
i'm always surprised and go yes that's
55:48
exactly what happens when god would
55:50
speak to you about your future
55:52
and he'd hold you there in his hand or
55:53
he'd sing he'd sing
55:55
a song to you he has his own songs he
55:57
sings to us so
55:59
it is a big event in heaven when he
56:01
sends them from himself to the earth
56:10
oh i can't hear you you can hear me now
56:13
probably
56:14
you know yeah i didn't switch it on um
56:16
steve dropped out but i'm going to ask a
56:18
couple more questions just because i
56:19
have them here
56:20
and i think they're really really good
56:22
okay so uh one person
56:24
asked if you could explain the scripture
56:27
from matthew chapter 7 verses 22
56:30
and 23 and it says many will say to me
56:32
in that day lord lord have we not
56:34
prophesied in your name cast out demons
56:36
in your name
56:36
done many wonders in your name and then
56:38
i will declare to them i never knew you
56:40
depart from me
56:41
you who practice lawlessness so the
56:43
person's question is
56:44
how can people walk in these miracles if
56:46
they don't know jesus
56:48
because number one it's a gift
56:52
uh just like anybody who's high up in
56:54
the fifo ministry
56:56
they they may enter into i'm not
56:58
pointing fingers at anybody
57:00
i know i'm just saying let's say
57:01
somebody's high up in the ministry
57:03
five-fold
57:04
they enter into a secret life of sin
57:07
and they keep that sin and they think
57:10
they're allowed to do it because their
57:12
gift is so great well that's not even
57:15
that's not
57:15
god's not going to say that but when he
57:18
gives us a gift
57:19
if he gives you a gift let's say of
57:21
healing a gift of prosperity a gift of
57:25
truth and hope a gift of evangelism
57:28
and he puts that gift in you he won't
57:30
stop that gift from operating
57:32
he will not stop that gift he says that
57:34
the irrevocable
57:35
he won't take it away from you so that
57:37
gift will keep right on operating and
57:39
they may even be doing
57:40
worse than just sinning they could be
57:42
doing really horrific things and not
57:44
telling anybody guess what god knows it
57:46
all
57:47
and that's why some will get up there
57:48
and he'll say depart from me i never
57:50
knew you because they didn't really make
57:52
a heart to heart conversion number one
57:55
they took use and abuse of the gift
57:58
the gift of influence the gift of other
58:00
things the gift won't stop working and
58:03
that's why i tell people
58:04
don't follow somebody because they have
58:06
great gifts
58:08
it doesn't say you'll know the people by
58:10
their gifts it says you will know them
58:11
by their fruit
58:13
yeah so if there's people out there and
58:15
they're they're
58:16
sleeping with everybody anywhere they
58:18
feel like it because they they think
58:20
that they have the right to they're so
58:22
powerful in their gift and they'll even
58:24
tell people if they're caught they say
58:25
well mike i'm so
58:27
far above everybody my gift wouldn't
58:29
work
58:31
my gift would stop working if god
58:33
thought i was wrong that's not true
58:34
either because even lucifer had a gift
58:37
he had a gift to influence he had a gift
58:39
to uh to
58:40
be involved in worship and we all know
58:42
how some satanic worship is or even that
58:45
how that still
58:46
influenced in the darkness he didn't
58:48
take that gift away so people can
58:50
operate in their gift and they'd be very
58:53
accurate
58:54
but if they're lying cheating stealing
58:57
committing of gross crimes that god
59:00
speaks about in the bible
59:01
they're in trouble with god and i would
59:04
not follow somebody if i knew that
59:06
if i knew they were picking people up
59:08
literally and they do sometimes to sleep
59:10
with
59:10
during their meetings and it does happen
59:14
you dump that person you don't listen to
59:16
that person now make sure this is a true
59:19
uh and accurate don't don't don't pick
59:21
up people and say well i think they're
59:23
bad
59:24
it's going to be found out anyway so i
59:26
would say make sure you look at the
59:28
fruit of the people
59:29
are they operating in in holiness are
59:32
there
59:32
they have their lives that they're
59:33
accountable are they loving their family
59:36
are they living according to the word of
59:37
god
59:38
they can't step outside god's guidelines
59:41
where this is sin
59:42
sin is sin when you sin you're
59:44
unrighteous
59:45
okay but that gift that's why the world
59:48
has gifts that are powerful they don't
59:50
know god
59:51
they have a gift to influence have a
59:52
gift in music they have a
59:54
gift and all kinds of things but if what
59:57
they're doing with that gift is evil
59:59
that doesn't make them okay to listen to
60:01
or watch
60:02
yeah and i think also this is something
60:04
i'm sure you've seen
60:05
heard this a lot too this scripture
60:07
specifically i've seen
60:09
the enemy kind of try to twist it where
60:11
people
60:12
almost become afraid they're like what
60:14
if i serve god
60:15
my whole life you know i follow the
60:17
scriptures i serve him faithfully and
60:19
all of a sudden he just says
60:20
depart from me i never knew you and it's
60:22
something that you know when i was in
60:23
missions i did a lot of like mission
60:25
schools raising up
60:26
youth yeah that was something i was very
60:28
adamant i was like that is a lie
60:31
a lie from the pit of hell it is yeah
60:34
it is a lie because if you're doing if
60:37
you're doing the work of god
60:39
the enemy will try to the enemy try to
60:41
bash you
60:42
and lie to you the whole time if you
60:45
know that you love jesus christ you know
60:47
you're doing what he has called us to do
60:49
to bring the truth to give the message
60:51
of the kingdom to influence people to
60:53
know christ
60:54
and you're helping them feeding them and
60:56
you're in the trenches doing stuff for
60:58
god
60:58
you know what you're going to know
60:59
you're going to get greatly rewarded in
61:02
heaven you will have rewards
61:04
that scripture has nothing to do with
61:06
those who know that they're
61:08
for christ and with christ that
61:10
scripture is about those who are living
61:12
their life
61:12
any way they want to and they think
61:14
because they have a gift
61:16
and god isn't saying anything he doesn't
61:19
care and there's been great people at
61:20
that
61:21
there's been people that's happened to
61:22
you and probably only the mercy of god
61:25
maybe somebody at the last moment before
61:27
they died
61:28
got them to give their christ their life
61:30
back to christ and repent for that stuff
61:32
but he's not talking that scripture is
61:34
not about people who know that they
61:36
belong to christ if you receive jesus
61:38
christ as your savior
61:39
and you know in your heart that's true
61:42
and you're following
61:43
the course he put you on then you you
61:46
are going to have a great time in heaven
61:50
he will not take your name or the lame's
61:52
book of life okay that doesn't happen
61:54
even that doesn't happen that easy
61:57
he wants you to know that he's proud of
61:59
you he is
62:00
blessed by your life you have well
62:02
pleased him that you're reaching out to
62:04
others sometimes when you have need
62:06
yourself the greatest thing to do is
62:07
reach out to help others
62:09
now the one thing is not your job to do
62:11
is you can't go
62:12
make somebody receive christ you share
62:14
the truth
62:15
you let them make that decision then you
62:17
go on to those who
62:19
who are reaching out back to you but
62:21
your words are like seeds in the heart
62:23
of that person
62:24
so that would not be you people who
62:26
think they've committed the
62:27
um pardonable sin have never committed
62:29
the impartial sin
62:31
people who commit the unpardonable sin
62:33
don't care that they've done it okay
62:35
they don't care they hate god they hate
62:36
what he has planned
62:38
if you're concerned about that you
62:40
definitely have not done that
62:42
but if you're out there doing things for
62:43
god especially
62:46
like in the mission field that god has
62:48
so
62:49
loved people and some of the most highly
62:52
honored people in heaven are
62:53
intercessors and those who are in
62:55
missions
62:56
amen okay so on that this is a great
62:59
question
63:00
the final question that segways from
63:02
this one
63:03
and it's um basically it's uh
63:06
can you share about the crowns will
63:08
receive in heaven what do they look like
63:10
and are they different or bigger
63:12
depending on our rewards
63:14
they're different they're very different
63:16
from each other and actually every
63:18
believer
63:19
in somewhere in your mountain you might
63:21
mention you have a crown
63:23
room you literally have a room that is
63:26
so
63:26
beautiful and light just shoots out of
63:29
i've been several people's
63:31
uh in their crown rooms in heaven i've
63:33
seen their crown rooms
63:34
and there's these beautiful like pillows
63:37
and things that are very ornamented by
63:39
the by gemstones from god himself he
63:41
designs these things
63:43
and they place those crowns on them
63:45
certain certain of those crowns you get
63:47
to wear in heaven when you get there
63:49
when it says we will throw our crowns at
63:51
his feet that's something that will
63:52
happen at one time with
63:53
all of us there but you can actually
63:56
wear some of those crowns like the crown
63:58
of life the soul winners crowns they're
64:00
all different from each other they're
64:01
not
64:02
they're not alike at all that's amazing
64:05
so cool i can't i can't wait to see them
64:08
you know it's interesting one just a
64:10
side comment i was thinking about i'm
64:12
i've i'm somebody who's been blessed
64:14
with a very big
64:15
imagination and there are times you know
64:18
i
64:19
i'm i doubt dabble in filmmaking and all
64:22
kinds of stuff
64:23
but there are some things that come to
64:25
my mind
64:26
that i do not know how to describe in
64:29
words like i'm like i've never seen this
64:31
before
64:31
i don't even know how i would
64:32
materialize this in the world and part
64:35
of me is wondering and like
64:36
there's specific things where i'm like
64:37
i'm wondering if god is showing me
64:39
glimpses
64:40
of certain things like you know almost
64:42
one-upping me he's like yeah you think
64:44
that was cool he's like check this out
64:46
you're going to see this in heaven you
64:47
know
64:49
he is definitely right now doing that
64:51
and in the past when people would get
64:52
though that they were afr
64:54
they were not i don't want to say fear
64:55
fear but they were hesitant to share it
64:58
with others
64:58
like paul wouldn't do it in the bible
65:00
okay paul's like i'm not even going to
65:02
try to tell people what this is like
65:04
but in these days of greater creativity
65:06
and invention
65:07
some of the things you see may be things
65:09
that actually begin to happen
65:11
on the earth this is what i have always
65:13
told people get a journal
65:15
please people get a journal just go get
65:18
you a little journal it doesn't have to
65:19
be anything fancy
65:21
and write down what you saw if you can
65:23
if you can
65:24
draw it draw it if you know what it does
65:27
write what it does and then date it and
65:29
don't get rid of that
65:30
that might be something god's going to
65:32
send to the earth and then he may give
65:34
you more about that thing he's done that
65:36
with me
65:36
many times and i do know there's greater
65:39
inventions
65:40
light is going to be used in many
65:41
different ways it's going to be used to
65:43
color our hair it's going to be used to
65:44
paint on this
65:45
i should have done that or i should have
65:47
presented it the thing that will happen
65:49
once this whole shift happens and the
65:51
darkness is like
65:52
wiped and pushed back and creativity
65:55
invention will explode
65:56
god's got things he's waiting to release
65:58
until this whole thing is dealt with the
66:00
justice comes
66:01
why would he end things if he's bringing
66:03
some of the greatest things ever he's
66:04
not gonna let the evil have it okay
66:06
but he will give it to the most
