well merry christmas everybody it's december 15 wednesday december 15 2021 welcome to the broadcast this is the next to the last cat curve broadcast uh for this year and then of course we pick it right back up next year uh by the way uh i'm i'm going to say this before i forget to make the announcement because i think or written at my note i might forget if i don't say it you know we have cats we have questions for cat already for today so we don't need those uh our staff decided it would be great to have you ask any and all kinds of questions about christmas as it relates to heaven or whatever cat knows is seeing understands so ask your questions about christmas for next week's broadcast most of the people put those questions underneath the youtube not in the chat to the right but underneath uh where you put your comments where they stay there not the ones that just disappear and roll off the screen um and there are other ways we get them too some people have hit reply and do different things that our preferred method is below youtube um and we'll try and look at other places as well but that's we're going to tell you that specific one so i want to thank everybody for your amazing donations yesterday we pretty much had an unprecedented number of donations and we really appreciate that this ministry is really growing by leaps and bounds uh after the first we've got several more people we'll be bringing on board in fact we'll make those announcements at the right time just a few of those we will announce like this i think that some of you have seen illumination who now works for us we we got her by making the announcement on the air so we will be making some announcements uh either next week or after the first i'll see what the staff wants to do and then people can then begin to send those in so we'll figure out how to do that and give you an address or email whatever the staff wants and we'll tell you which positions we're looking for so but anyway thank you very much for your generosity i know it's the as you we approach the year end many of you are trying to to determine what you want to do with your what things you want to do with your um final giving for the year we certainly appreciate you thinking about us you know i've said that we've built uh we've dug seven wells in uganda and and then we've doubled the size we paid for the construction of doubling the size of the health clinic on in that ugandan village i haven't even shown you that picture yet uh we have to work we're committed to do 24 to dig 24 new wells in and around that community and region and some of you who saw that video we'll show it several more times you saw that the people were drinking some of them when the water is running off of the piglet tree into the water that they they put in their drinking water and they bring it home it's just a horrific thing so we're digging freshwater wells thank you so much for your i i would say your help you know it's not just you helped us you did it it was your income that brought that money in and we sent it to mike and laurie sally of show mercy some of you want to check their ministry out show mercy.org they are in uganda so mike and laurie sally dear friends of ours we've known him for about 15 years they're doing a bang-up job out there and so we're we're going to do at least 24 or more wells next year we will probably increase that i feel like the lord's showing us that we'll increase that number significantly and maybe there'll be other areas we don't know but right now uganda's our is our place anyway thank you for that get your questions about christmas remember that if if you get kicked off this is why you need to be subscribed here so we've got your email address and can send you uh notices wherever we go i mean what if we're going to different things we are live today on facebook live youtube live live and elijahstreams.com live so we're live in four places so if we get knocked off and one um we'll be in those other three so um i think that's it all right let's bring in kat kerr here hello everybody how you doing good good to see you merry christmas to you yeah merry christmas so you're going to ask we're going to ask a whole lot of christmas questions next week you probably heard that and we want to have you just elaborate on what you talked about christmas town all that so i'll have you just kind of elaborate on that next week so well yeah that'll be fun so listen um we'll just jump in um before we have any questions cat what kind of anything current events you'd like to share uh well i do there are there are things out there everybody knows about and things people can't know about right now but i i can continue to tell you that that foundation of the left is crumbling um there's other people leaving their positions because they're being exposed in that is privately that i can't announce who that is but that big support this is the thing when you lose your support like you were saying you can't do anything that is absolutely true but guess what it's also true for the left all the people who are jumping on that bandwagon are jumping off many of them are jumping off some of those are really big supporters and i can tell you bottom line why i can tell you why they want to have money left over because they keep being asked for more and more and more you can't give yourself to something that is totally darkness and think they're going to let you go how about if i give you that as a tip you can't do it you can run in and agree and participate with things that are evil and think that will let you go i can also tell a story about that there are people who were part of an extreme dark uh uh thing that was going on this is probably maybe 15 years ago and they actually had seen demons talk to demons and not trying to scare anybody they gave permission they gave permission and they thought what they got to do was exciting and amazing but guess what they wouldn't let them go they tormented them for the next 10 years of their life and and they just couldn't get rid of they didn't get rid of them because you can't give yourself to something it's like what god says what you enter into will enter into you and that's how simply something that's one liners of some of the most powerful things he ever says to me but what you choose to enter into will enter into your soul that's just what happens and either you think about it you want to run after it or else you give them a tie to you and these people actually gave a tie to to this these beings that were um beginning to torment them when they were done with the fun thing they thought they were going to be a part of which was dark was really bad i'm not going to tell you what that was but they couldn't get rid of them finally they had to repent and and cleanse their soul and every every place they lived they had a place that the demons would always come in at night and torment him they couldn't do anything about it so they had somebody get hold of me i didn't meet with them i told them what they would have to do and they could never ever go to that place again and they would have to just you know make sure that they got that out of their soul number one but they actually had to renounce anything or any hold or tie that darkness have with them that they gave permission to that's the difference and people who are just maybe attacked every now and then that's it that's illegal that's taken to the course of heaven sometimes and sometimes god just comes in supernaturally and ends that that's like an attack this is not what these people were doing they willingly participated in these evil acts that were happening somewhere and that's why it took longer to get rid of it they finally broke it they have had no no nothing else come they stopped coming they severed that tie they severed that portal that was open by their own repentance and then um having to take communion over the whole thing and you know what they attempted to come back but they said they couldn't they served only the living god they would not serve the enemy again so that's why it's so important to make sure you never get into one of those places or participate like that it's really hard to get rid of and that's what people are finding out now who already have been a part of this thing this year and a half long thing that's been going on in our country more and more people think i can make money if i let them use me for this or if i lie about this or if i cheat in this way i'll make money well they're finding out they're losing their money that's what's happening they're losing their money and once they make a tie or a contract with this darkness that's going on they won't let you go that's why you don't want to participate in the beginning you stand strong against everything that's going on you keep running after god right now in your life and don't forget to celebrate he's still saying that to me god has already seen the beginning to the end he knows exactly what will happen and i know there's a lot of theories and assumptions and people think they know what's going to happen i can tell you god is going to decide when that does happen when it does it will be so great you won't have to wonder if you'll hear about it so this is just a tip to people or those who are still in the darkness you better get out while you can if you don't you probably will lose everything because this is an evil thing happening in our country you cannot steal a country you cannot give yourself to satan or his evil ex and think he will let go of you if you're already stepping outside of that maybe you never got born again you better get bored again really quick i will say that you better get born again because that's probably the one thing that can save you from all the stuff you've been involved in but there's already people they've already got some people who are being witnesses um to a lot of these accounts that excuse me that are happening so i would just encourage you and i'm gonna keep doing it get out of that darkness while you can repent make sure you make sure you tell somebody who is accountable who is an authority in the area that's just looking to see what's going on so i just want to encourage people those things are happening right now people are uh they're distancing themselves from some people they're actually getting out of these things themselves but people who have money are finding that if something doesn't happen to stop this whole thing they themselves will have no money or property so let me tell you evil will never bless you evil can't create life or hope or something that's going to help there is no help in evil and darkness that comes from god that comes from belonging to jesus christ so all you who've been out there have been strong and stayed strong and given hope to people that that god does know what's going on don't give up okay you got to stay strong it says making your stand and standing there for us i just want to applaud you yeah yeah making a great stand for jesus christ he made everything we know and see nothing is hidden from him so if you think because god's not saying anything right now to everybody that does not mean he doesn't he does have a plan he he does he does have a plan for all of this that's good ken i think you said something a minute ago and i thought you know i'm going to ask her to expound on that you said people had sold out to darkness and you got them into repentance and to receiving the lord if they hadn't but then you said they took communion over that thing or something to the that effect and you're you're speaking about communion as if it's a weapon and let me just ask you to expand uh expound on the weapon of communion what does that actually do when people take communion it is so powerful and unfortunately most churches has just become a tradition yeah i will give you a good example of that i remember where i was attending at one time it had become like a tradition that doesn't make god very happy because there is power in the blood of jesus christ and his surrender totally to the father's will and even his own willingness to do he didn't have to do anything at the cross and no matter what people think don't take the crosses off your wall now that you think he's not on it anymore his own personal mark he makes as a carpenter is a cross that's what he does even in heaven when he makes things that is significant it means everything to all those who are a believer who have received the the sacrifice that christ did and died for us he shed his own blood for us that is a powerful thing in the spirit it breaks things sometimes that nothing else can and especially people if they've had things going on in their house at night maybe they may be familiar spirits or other kind of spirits if there's nothing else you can do you've prayed maybe you've fasted you need to take communion yourself over your property and then you go outside and you pour some on the land and say with the blood of jesus christ i redeem this land a shockwave of jesus christ will it tell you it will embed itself in the property you're living on and then you invite holy spirit to invade it just invite the spirit of god to invade it and let me tell you what it'll be hard for anything spiritually bad or evil to come on that property it would be too painful for them taking communion is something some people actually do every day and i do it about once a month myself at least sometimes more than that and recently we just cleansed our land again and let me tell you what the peace of god with the presence of god will infuse that the presence of god is in communion it represents many things it represents the sec reminds us of the sacrifice christ did but it's something that brings us together if you do that with your family it will be so powerful in the spirit it brings a bond with you and your family together when you take that together recognizing together as a family what christ did for you sometimes it opens things you never could get open sometimes it breaks the power of the enemy that nothing else will break i even tell people who've been sick for a long time you should be taking communion over your body it says very clearly in the bible what you know what he did by his stripes what does it say you are healed okay the blood it helps your mind and your mental faculties it just does physically mentally and emotionally it can heal things and break things off of you that never could be broken off before wow that's my you know my spiritual father wade taylor last five years of his life he was my spiritual father he would take communion every single day and i believe he sometimes several times today his and his he believed that the lord had shown him that the closest thing we have you know the tree of life isn't on the earth right now he he strong strongly believed that the taking communion was the closest thing we had to a tree of life on the earth as far as the natural you know elements that type of thing is interesting you know and he was a very healthy man until you know finally it was his time and suddenly he was gone but uh yeah that was i i've never looked at communion the same since he since he said that because i thought you know that what if he's true what if it's true that there's so much more healing available to us there is you know and i remember at least i was in at the time that they had just did it they were doing it again just as a rope thing as a just a normal thing they did once a month and god yelled from heaven to me it is holy it is holy it is holy and i'm telling you the presence of god fell so strong on me he said you will say something about this and so i wrote all this down i gave it to uh one of the prophets visiting visiting and uh they read it to the congregation like a week later they read it and the power of god fell on the entire church and people actually got on their knees and repented for not taking it for the full uh the power of god that was in it the fullness of his sacrifices in there well what what did he represent he represented life hope joy healing empowerment that's what's in that's what's in taking communion that's what that means that's profound i mean it's just so profound yeah when i was raised up but i'll get into these questions here when i was raised in a fundamental church it was like every 13 weeks we had a communion they even did the foot washing with it and all that but it was like if we could figure out a way to get out of that particular uh church service and stay home and once in a while we'd figure out something like let's go to the beach today it was it was just a ritual there was no power in it and we just looked for ways to get out boy i would never do that you know with my understanding it's very powerful here's here's the first question um this is a two-part i'll just read them both but my mother was in her last days in the hospital in hospice she kept telling me about these beautiful atriums she kept seeing i personally believe god was showing her glimpses of heaven before she passed so question when are there atriums in heaven and two does god reveal heaven to people in their last hours or moments to comfort them or to prepare them before they die um well that the last part is absolutely true some people it's their first glimpse of not just having many people in their last maybe maybe the last week especially they'll begin to see family members who are in heaven they'll just see their faces or something sometimes they might hear them say something that's not like they're going to abide there with them but he is letting them have glimpses of having something else they'll see many times are their own angels or or they'll just see angels in the room that's really a clue that they're probably not going to stay very long and but if everything jesus christ unless they walk up and he walks up to him and say you know you will live and not die or it's not your time but sometimes he'll catch them up there and tell them there and then send them back but if if they begin to tell you that i've seen jesus then that either means they're going to be fully healed or they're going to be fully healed by going to heaven and uh so yes a lot of that happens sometimes you'll give them glimpses of mansions in heaven or the streets of gold or even the throne sometimes so that is absolutely that part's absolutely true i think because their spiritual body is getting more aware and um even when it gets close to them stepping out and they literally step out of their body that's what they do if they're sitting up naturally they'll just step right out of their the physical body it'll fall back but there they are right there looking at their own body that's happened to a lot of people and then jesus would say it's not your time so they have to go back in wow there are many different things that could happen some people were here heavenly choir saying that part is very true and uh and i'll tell us i'll talk about something else in a minute about the choirs but that is true and yes uh even sometimes when people are really sick maybe they're not terminal they will see glimpses of places in heaven and i believe the atrium thing that they're seeing is probably some beautiful part of the gardens of heaven uh there's a friendly forest in heaven they have beautiful gardens surrounding that there's a butterfly there's like this beautiful meadow where butterflies are uh they actually will sing you hear them singing so they could hear a heaven part of heaven singing they could see angels i could see family members there and that does bring peace to them and sometimes not just peace some people get really excited when they when they have glimpses of heaven like that that's amazing well that's it's encouraging because as i said the number of times my mom's real close i'm kind of curious by the way regarding that now my mom's memory is going we just got back from ohio she's got now she doesn't remember from conversation to conversation a few minutes late does god let me ask it this way does god have a harder time getting a hold of someone like that who needs a little bit more of him or does he have an easier time because she's tuned out of life what would that be like for her to maybe i think it wouldn't matter what state they're in mentally emotionally or physically when he wants to make himself known or let them begin many times if we're saying they feel no matter where they are on their path if they belong to him it he already has that connection with them in their spirit when he's ready to show them something he's going to do it but normally that will begin to change that person and even if they can't remember what they ate the day before who visit them the day before they normally will not forget if they begin to have encounters and sometimes it's not like a face-to-face encounter sometimes it's his presence uh sometimes they they may say oh i feel really good right now i i feel amazing i feel such peace on me that's usually because christ could be in that room with them right there in that moment i just know that sometimes it might be a little bit easier in my thinking if your natural mind begins to shut down or your memory system the reason for that is they can't remember the things that they were angry about they can't remember things you know they can't remember their cares they can't remember their concerns they don't remember any things that were said to them or maybe things that they did that they shouldn't have you know maybe unkind words that's gone from them so that does totally open it up for the lord to begin to either speak to them or begin to show them things so this that might be a good thing well you know it's interesting you would say that i wasn't going to share this but you know my life's an open book right now but you know what what's that you love it it's so open because every millions are white i know well we went out in march and i i was thinking i was being a good dutiful obedient loving son to offer her to come and live with us from ohio and boy oh heck broke liz and i understand this is this is really what happens to a lot of seniors at this age they if you think if they're thinking you're taking their blasted i mean she didn't say any bad words but she was furious he was okay so now fast forward we just can't went out there in ohio and we were itching her along and then she called me after we we got back and and she's now she's inviting herself to live with me instead of the other i said i said well mom you you know after you treated me so horribly and she goes what are you talking about and she made me repeat it five times and she didn't even remember after five seconds after i told her she said now tell me again what i did then we found out later she doesn't even remember any of us flying out there during march yeah that does that actually doesn't happen as part of the process of just being prepared many times just to just to leave um but that's normal and you're right that's very normal and even most people when they of course if they're still around here around a heaven uh a hundred years old you you should see some of them some of them are sharp as attack but in the natural most people's bodies and their systems and the way they operate their thinking it kind of begins to shut down some uh they may be alert in every other way but their memory from like the day before whatever like she was saying to you that might be god's blessing sometimes because like you said she didn't remember even saying that yeah it feels like well i had i had actually been again here's that open book thing i was really wounded i was hurt and i kind of cared that i kept forgetting her in my heart all this time after i found out yesterday that she has no recollection i'm thinking what what how what purpose would it be to even have any hurt left what have i heard about something that she has no recollection of ever doing so it's like it just fell off it just fell off it's almost like maybe a child does something not to hurt you on purpose but it just happens you know and uh especially in the different growing years they might say something hurtful teenagers do that sometimes and it it it's part of their growing the young on the young side but when they're older it's just part of what's natural and i think that is i know people who've forgotten that went through traumas and stuff not not my family of other people had horrible traumas when they got closer to that age they didn't even remember it it's like it just naturally left them and they're happy i've also known people who like almost couldn't stand being around somebody and now they love them it's the same same people but but they really love them because the person who was holding that was gone because the memory part was gone so yes steve you can't you can't hold it against somebody who to them like well that never happened i would never say that they mean to you i never said that yeah i mean i was smarting and i can't you know i was you were hurting that hurt so anyway that's good all right here we go he goes i'm i'm finding out that my seven-year-old son is a seer what is your number one piece of advice for a young seer for their parents his sister has an autoimmune issue and he said that once while we were praying for her healing he looked up and saw a small angel about four inches tall with wings wearing a red dress with her hand on my daughter's foot praying for her would that have been her guardian angel that my son saw or a different one sent for specific purpose so it's kind of a multi-part there that probably would be a different one sent for a specific purpose but since you brought that whole thing up i i have known families who had a child who was handicapped in some way they get extra angels assigned to them just because of that what we would call a disability uh they get extra ones assigned to them and this young man now is so almost absolutely normal he has some physical things not causing him pain but growing up they said he wouldn't live they said he would never have a normal mind he would never be able to talk never feed himself and this was being fed to this young child's parents like their whole life they refused to accept that they made sure he had everybody the care that he had but they talked to him normal they didn't treat him like there's something wrong with him and he has two angels that are with him all the time besides his guardian angel and they're there because of this this handicap thing he has like i said this is like 30 years later and you know to see him he's so filled with the light of god he's a believer and he's such a testimony to people because of how he has grown in every way that the doctor said he wouldn't be alive but there were two angels assigned to him and i knew somebody else who had someone who was grown and they also had two other angels and finally i just asked holy spirit why are those other angels with him they looked different than from their guardian angels and they said oh they're sent to they they like protect the anointing that they carry they're there just to be uh yeah to bring things down from heaven to them that god wants to put into them i'm pretty certain that's what that four inch angel was that was like a little messenger angel bringing something down they wouldn't be part of the host but they probably were brought down from heaven with one of the hosts probably brought them down there so that was great as far as being a seer i would get a journal most important to write down things that he's seeing it's really important that they do that when he gets older he'll be very grateful for that journal uh like right the day what he said he saw just write in his words what he said and then anytime he comes i've already told some of my my daughters to make sure that they do that and so one of them has actually started cataloging and now this child is 10 and he's not stopped seeing things but it's very powerful to him that he can read about the things he said that he heard said or that he saw so definitely most important thing you can do is uh no matter what god ends up by doing with that gift he has it will be very powerful one day make sure you're writing it down yeah and what what's the deal with the four inch angel versus a seven foot angel i mean what would you say about that i would say possibly whatever it is that the child is um whatever it was you said that they had it probably there may be like a tribe of those little angels like that made for that specific thing that they were diagnosed with and that maybe that may be something that god sends maybe his life is in them they're they're probably putting the life of god in them oh the peace of god in them so that would be their only assignment that would be what they would be sent for probably to keep that child in peace or the presence of god yeah i guess the issue was it was she just said it was an autoimmune issue so she didn't say that so okay melanie asked how old does god look how old would we perceive him to be in earthly terms i've heard you describe kind of seeing his face but i've also heard you describe almost a little bit of a veil so i mean how do you see him you and i talked on the cruise that one time and i said are you telling me cat that you're sitting down sitting down talking face to face with the god of the whole cosmos and you just like yeah you know that should be crazy it would be like asking that question to a child that really saw something let's say your child went and saw somebody or met somebody and you maybe try to convince them i don't think you saw them they would be so adamant uh that the child like part of me there's nothing in me that could make up anything he wouldn't use me at all if he if if i did that i i'm a detailed person so i'm always going to see details one of the reasons why i see him clearly is he chose me because i have a photographic memory and i am a detailed person like i'm not going to hear just a sentence that he says i i'm taking places that i have to remember all that i saw and then they have to write that down if it's things that god came and told me personally and he said i want you to i want you to share this with people then i have to remember exactly what he said it's not like it becomes um familiar in any way i won't even use that term because the power uh the power he carries i'm sure he has to probably uh maybe minimize that a little bit just for me to be able to be around him i probably i sometimes i feel like when i'm when i'm seeing him and it's just to be in his presence i feel like i'm going to melt and go inside of him i don't know how to yeah outs to explain that the love that comes from him is so powerful and it's it's not just what i feel his appearance is quite striking if i could say that you feel life coming from him because it did we all lived there so it's like he's holding everything in him all of time is in him he didn't appear somewhere time came from him and i know i i love the one-liners he tells me to tell people they get their heads so undone they try to wrap their head around it but most of these things are spiritually um discerned i would say in his normal appearance because i've seen him like a certain way many times then there's times i've seen him with flames of fire with lightning bolts shooting out of him when he's walking against the darkness and stuff like that his own appearance begins to change it talks about the wrath of god and any believer you should know this that we are not appointed under that wrath that he was demonstrating that would be evil in darkness and wickedness that he despises evil he despise what it does to people so if he was gonna catch me up there and talk about the justice that is coming then his whole appearance would be to bring justice that would show me that that fierce side of him okay the loving father side of him which is what i see many times i know his hair is made out of light remember the father is all spiritual but he still has the ability to hold me if he wants to or i can just stand next to him i can see into his eyes and usually they're like blue flames of fire they're they look blue to me blue flames of fire but what comes out of him if you could picture um i love the northern lights i've not seen them in person but i've seen god and that's what that rainbow looks like coming out of him if you ever wondered it's not a stagnant rainbow it's not like you could just paint it around him and it would just be there and not have life and movement and i would have to say seeing the northern lights in the way that they move like this coming out of him continually and on these waves of his rainbow which he it comes from him no man made the rainbow people it comes from the living god it's part of his own appearance and his person and out of that comes these little spirits of life they'll ride on this rainbow then ride back in him that's what you used to do when you lived inside god it says in him we live we move we have our very being the prophets and poets of old have spoken of these things what things when they were shown that way in the past god would show himself to people sometimes and sometimes it was someone who was a poet and they actually wrote poems about that and so one of those made it in the word of god so that's just a part of him to see him like that the creative side where i would see jesus step out of the father and the father would say something and then he would make what he said that's why he was called the word we know in the book of john it says that we know in the book of john when john said the word was with god and was god and there was nothing that was made that was not made by him that was jesus christ that's who he the word came to the earth and died uh as the son of god and so they're one and the same the word jesus christ are the same but when he was the word he only had a spiritual body he was all spirit it was still a body i know in your mind you can't imagine you think of something like a little like a spirit like whatever you want to call it like the spirit of a person or something they're much more there's much more to them than just some little wispy thing if you're in a spirit world which heaven is and everyone there in the spiritual body they look solid in that world okay so when i see the father most of the time he looks like he's solid although he's all spirit so i've seen him with love coming out that consumes like the whole army of god before they're going to go somewhere um to bring justice for him over someone on the earth he'll literally go and just stand in their midst and every one of them will be permeated with his love he loves them too and his love and and just empowerment and and when you see that he's he is kind and he is good and many people don't see the father is good but jesus himself said there's none good but the father and so when you see there's many different parts of him sides of him uh that's who he is but i i'm always undone when he comes most of the time unannounced because what is on his heart to share i'm i'm his revelator that's what he calls me that means i reveal for him i don't reveal for a man so i'm not gonna usually i can answer questions ask me if i've been told or shown it otherwise i can't answer that i can't answer for him if i haven't been shown or told something so it's really quite undone sometimes the room i'm in like where i sleep which is in my office built this moment there's a huge portal in that room and and sometimes he would come down through that portal but sometimes most likely in the hotel room a lot of times he'll just walk through the wall like it's not there and he'll begin to tell me stuff sometimes he'll tell me to write it down sometimes he'll write on the wall and we know that even in the word of god it talks about him doing these things so for him those are normal things he does when he when he knows somebody who's going to tell the truth who will not embellish on what he what he said which is extremely significant even john the baptist had one of the greatest revelations ever given on the earth that's why they said he's the greatest prophet of all that's why that's in there he announced literally here is the son of god he actually got to say that even though in the natural he was jesus's cousin when he spoke those words he wasn't speaking from a natural viewpoint he was speaking from a divine point and he never changed as much as that he came that he came to say that you had to repent of your sins right he was one of the first ones to give that message so what he said was so powerful when he actually said here he is uh the the first and only person on the earth who could actually say here's jesus christ the son of the living god this is the messiah that was a powerful word but he never changed what he said because that's what god told him to say wow yeah and you've always been obedient that way you know almost to a frustrating point because people will ask you something i've seen it even on um what's the kenneth copeland channel i can't think of any victory channel or whatever and flashpoint and they'll try to get you to answer a question you'll say i can only tell you what god told me and then he'll launch into your prophecy that was that's pretty i've learned learned a good way um also that's part of that same question is does god the father does he look like a grandpa does he look like a dad who's older what what age impression when he leaves well i know you're wanting most people will judge somebody by their skin okay or conditioning is a skin and does it have wrinkles does it not have wrinkles does it have like brown spots and most people judge people nor in the natural you know um if they have white hair no hair i mean i i can't answer him in that context i cannot put him in a category as a human i know that i see life in him i see still even now talking you can still see his face very clearly and it's filled with life there's no age in him he's never going to age his hair is white it's alive his hair on his head is living it's not short hair it's down below his shoulders uh he has this amazing uh wonderful beard um it just you know i can't i tell people say what do you think he looks like kenny rogers he doesn't look like a human everyone fails in comparison to him because of the stuff he carries that makes him who he is but i can just say that you will you'll never regret giving yourself to his son that is the one where you are assured of meeting him in person he's excited about seeing you he cannot wait for you to get back home to heaven and i hope this gives you a glimpse of the other side of dying for you you're losing something for him he's gaining something he's gaining his son or his daughter back to himself he is so excited all of heaven celebrates when they come home so for them there's there's there's no loss in their mind uh from the time they step out of the spiritual body they're stepping right there they feel his presence they see their angels their excitement floods them you know i mean it's not like they don't love you to actually love you even more but but just to be in his presence i understand why jesus when he had to live on the earth he'd go away to the mountains to to be with his father he would go away to go be that he needed it after living here with humans are you kidding and so king himself loves the father and i think for him the greatest thing he gets to do is take us back to him when you come home to heaven he walks you up the steps of god's throne the father's throne and gives you back to him he says your son your daughter they've come home and let me tell you the celebration will start in heaven at that time but but he is not little he's not a little person in any way whatsoever but this is what i love about the father one of the greatest things i like to say about him is he could be a hundred feet tall two thousand feet tall whatever he wants to be he can be that size i think sitting on the throne many times and to me he would look like maybe i don't know 10 15 feet high he he doesn't want to make himself invisible to you if you're coming home to meet him but i've seen him holding the earth in his hands so i hope you get this picture i've seen him back in time when he was making the earth holding it in his hand this is the father when the word would step out he'd make it gave it to the father the father began to speak over the earth itself he would pour water from himself he's going to put the water on the earth he poured from his own south the river of the river of life that comes from him he poured that in as the ocean on the earth and so whatever they did they did together and so i've seen him that big to hold the earth in his hand i've seen him be you know make himself well call enormous eyes just to hold you he'll stand up on the throne and hold you to himself and i also know this about him that even though he's on the throne he himself can make himself not leaving the throne small enough to step inside of himself to play with all the little spirits of life that's who you were are you serious with you in himself while he's sitting on the throne people he knows what's going on if you think he's willing to give this earth that he loved that he spoke over to evil what do you think he didn't have and he kicked it out it got unseated lost his place lost his authority lost his power lucifer did you think he's changed his mind about that because he has not he loves you too much and this time is too important for him to give it over to evil all i know is they're going to lay down roll over and beg god for mercy when those days of justice fall upon them and for some of them it will be too late wow wow catboy the anointing hit you right there god came god came down wow wildcat cat let me can i explore a little bit you talk about the son loves the fat father loves his son and son loves the father i think we've talked about this a little bit let me drill down you know when i was raised up we'd always make sure we pray in the name of jesus make sure you say the name of jesus and it became like a a formulaic word make sure you mention the name of jesus because then god can has to do it but but is there something in when we pray in the name of jesus that we should at that moment almost tap into how much the father loves jesus as we're saying that as opposed to just making sure you pronounce jesus or yeshua what what is that go ahead and understand who you're talking about when you use this name uh and if if there's probably if you're saying it just from head knowledge this is what you want to know don't ever say his name from head knowledge okay you need to say it from revelation like what i just spoke okay that's how you should feel every time you say his name for any purpose you're having power in that name of jesus that's why it is one of your greatest weapons the name of the name of christ okay his name his blood uh his sacrifice his revelation of who he is he right now he right now is the king of glory people uh he has many other titles besides jesus christ when you talk about him as your savior and what he did for you he also gave you power over all the power of the enemy he gave us three things you see him from that viewpoint it should almost be like a threat to hell that you are saying the name of jesus christ wow wow yeah that's a whole lot different well that's what the lord's been showing me lately is is to tap into to that to him to the reality um yeah and this one you kind of answered this this is the next question but you kind of addressed this it says before jesus came to the earth and he was called the word in heaven did his spiritual body then look like what we know as his human body or what we think of as his human body or was his body more like i don't know what i don't know what this means was his body more like the holy spirit i i think this person's grasping between um a cloud like the holy spirit or the body of jesus but i i think they both have um a spiritual butt right yeah i would say when you are you talking about let me get the timing right are they talking about what jesus looked like when he stepped out of his physical body let me see when jesus came to the earth and he was called the word in heaven he was called the word did his spiritual body then in heaven look the same as his human body looked on earth oh when he was the word did it look the same as the physical body on earth that seemed to be the question no physical body changed him from what he looked like because if it looked just like the word why did not satan recognize him oh good point oh good point he did not know when he took him to the mountain temptation that was the son of the living god he didn't know that he was trying to find out who he was he was always pursuing who is he until he himself said who he was he did not know he did not know he was the word that was with god the word was all spiritual body that was his divine body a spiritual body a spiritual body like we were just talking about isn't a wispy cloud i know what they're talking about you're talking about what they've seen on tv or movies this little wispy thing steps out they can go through walls and the reason why uh your spiritual body down here could walk through a wall is that physical wall is a temporary substance it's even a temporary realm the physical realm is not the original realm the spiritual realm where the whole world called heaven was created where tribes of angels were made where you go back home to live in that place you don't pass to the walls in heaven and your spiritual body okay you have substance in your spiritual body but as far as the appearance thing the word was very powerful he could go in and out wherever he wanted to do whatever he wanted to he had no flesh attached to him the other sacrifice you don't realize he made was he was willing not just to walk and live in a physical body he had to keep the physical body wow and so when your little spirit person leaves god when you lived in god you didn't look like this okay you had a little appearance you had a face you little face you had body you could play inside of god and the river of life climbed the mountain that's in him a ride in and out on the waves of the rainbow you could do those things in your little spiritual body but you didn't look this gave you an identity okay that's one of the reasons why he wanted you to have a fleshly body number one so you could live in this physical body in this physical world and do things for him here but as opposed to the word the word look different than jesus christ did because the flesh wrapped around your spiritual body your spiritual body actually adapts to the flesh because when your throat man steps out of this body when mine does it looks the same as if i was in my fleshly body except i look a whole lot younger and so were you one day so know that satan did not recognize who jesus christ was he didn't know he was the word okay who made him actually uh satan was created he's a created being he didn't know that that was the word he didn't know at all and that that was part of the bushwhack people so that was part of the butch whack that jesus would almost have a disguise that satan wouldn't recognize for a very long time jesus could do things he wanted to say what he wanted to and and satan i'm sure was quite shocked when jesus christ you know living on the earth began to cast demons out of things that really freaked him out i'm really sure now he said okay this person's got power he's got power i i don't didn't know he had this power uh and he's not really as brilliant as he wants people to think he is because when he got kicked out the heaven part of his mind was seared by that lightning bolt i'm just letting you know so he did not know that that jesus christ was the word of god because jesus himself with his fleshly body looked different than the word and right now he still looks like jesus christ who lived and walked on the earth except for this he has his glorified body already he was glorified that body was glorified when he stepped up from hell came up from hell and stepped into that physical body that was dead laying on that slab life infused it but not just life but the glory of god infused the body of jesus christ and he walks around now in his physical glorified body in heaven so when he comes to see me that's that's who i see is the one in the glorified body and you know when you said uh this is the first time it ever clicked that we would have looked different inside the father because we would only look like we looked down because i'm a combination of my mother and my father that's the appearance i took on that's right because i had a natural mother father so i don't look totally different in heaven before god selected the family for me i guess yes he knew all along he knew you would be looking like just like you do now steve he knew everybody would be looking like that like they do right now in their physical body he knew when you were in him you were chosen at that point for some things in your life he put a little mark on you he knew i would be a prophet he knew you would make a home for the prophets to come and say whatever god wanted to say he knew that we probably knew each other we probably were friends inside of him that would be cool to know that would be really interesting you think so we wouldn't be doing so because i know those who were friends inside of god if he chose you to be a part of your lifetime uh in a significant way he would absolutely choose people that kids that you were like call them kids they all little they're all little at all like a bunch of little kids living in him and and you had i would see little kids sometimes with little groups playing with each other and doing things with each other and we we can have a whole whole just segment about life and god uh really that would be quite fascinating to find out revelation about what did you do in there what went on there what does it look like and there's another whole thing but i'm pretty sure that we probably were friends i know my husband and i were friends when we were we were part of this the little group that we had uh inside god that we played there's millions inside of him but there's no back to god there's no size to god it's like inside of him he's part of infinity and that at one time you know before he made the earth we all everyone who ever was or will be lived in him you can imagine in your head let's hope you maybe that makes you realize how powerful he is about who he is uh he is limitless in his understanding and his knowledge and in his revelation he's unlimited in almost every way he's unlimited can i ask you a a difficult question that some watching will even um it would be their question it would be their question god knew you before you were born he knew what you would look like before you were born and then there are people who are product of of either born out of wedlock in some cases rape how do you what do you say to people who say but what about me how could god have known me and allowed me to either have children of abuse or what do you say about the plan of god and what sometimes we're allowed to go through in this life i think one day when you get your book given to you that was written about you in heaven you'll understand that he didn't choose any of the evil stuff at all that wasn't had nothing to do with god at all he sent us to this earth it's an imperfect earth there's imperfect people everybody is held accountable for what they did they they there there will be an accountability uh of course when you receive jesus christ that has something to do with wiping that away but i can tell you this he sent you this is what happened he picked you for certain things he sent you to earth at the time he needed you to be here he didn't choose those people to be wicked they weren't always wicked when they were children they weren't wicked okay so everybody making their own choices are raising their children in a certain way because of what's in them and that's why i always i talk to young people a lot i've done young people meetings and i say you have to understand that you're not just going to be raising children one day you are shaping souls that came from god for his use do not be abusive i'm i'm telling them this already but you know what that's if they watch a lot of violent stuff just go into their soul and even psychiatrists know this they don't understand the workings of the soul or what the soul looks like but what you what you choose what you listen to all the time will become a part of you what you watch all the time would become a part of me and eventually you might even act out some of those things you see and that's why there's evil satan helps that to happen he makes sure it happen happens and yet there's some people who grew up in a violent household that that never part part took of that they they were strong they never allowed that to affect their life or how they lived it later and became and were totally totally different people than what that person was that had them so you have to understand god didn't create he didn't make evil happen he didn't even make lucifer satan if you go back that far let's go that far he may lucifer to be an anointed being who would help lead worship for him to create glory for him to be a light for him that's what that's what lucifer's job was he made him for that he didn't make him to be evil it says in the bible iniquity was found in him that was significantly because god didn't put that in him okay by his own thoughts by lucifer's own thoughts and own wicked desires to be greater than god and want to rule from that came evil began to be birthed inside of him before it came out so because there is evil present in this world one day there won't be any we can look at it that way but god didn't choose you to be tormented he didn't choose that those people who raised you had every right to choose to do what was right regardless of what within them they had every right to be kind to you to nourish you to nurture you and everything and know god and no happiness and joy and not have your mind tormented later in your life all the things that happened to you as a child but god didn't create evil in this earth he didn't know evil would be here but he also sent his son for the very purpose that you could be free from anything you went through you can be free from any event no matter how bad it was or when it happened you don't have to carry that stuff on the inside of you and that's why he came to bring freedom in life he had an appointed time to be here even jesus christ had to be made into a seed this is what it says christ was made into a seed he was made okay he had he was going to have flesh on him and i think on my our next um report we do i'll actually read the poem holy spirit gave me about when the announcements began to made it be made in heaven that the word would die for us that the word would be made flesh which it says in the bible he was planted as a seed in the womb of mary but there's this whole beautiful story it's called the year before christmas and what literally began to happen in heaven um you know before he was even sent and i'm not going to do that today but we'll do that next week but you have to understand god has been from the beginning to the end and no matter what you thought you could do that would be better he has a plan he was willing to sacrifice his own son who was tormented and tortured and so horribly abused wrongfully accused uh you know unjustly treated and and basically murdered he knew that his son would go through that but what comes from that and this is the thing you even though it's not god's intention to make you suffer for him his son suffered for all of us you can take your life no matter what you've been through and you can lose all of that all of that horror all of that abuse all that torment all that trauma lucifer from your soul in jesus name and jesus will come pull it out of you and it will be like it didn't happen in other words you might think about it but there'll be no torment in it there'll be no suffering in it because we can be totally free from all of the effects of evil but god didn't make people bad he didn't make evil itself and the evil one who's done this will be more tormented than anything that ever existed throughout all the time he satan will be more tormented than any other anyone else who ends up in that lake of fire satan will be the most hated being in there the most tormented and he will have no power whatsoever so you can think of it's one thing you to be in a place of torment but when you everyone is tormenting that one person and they can't escape or get away uh that is his end he will have nothing from anything he's done god also knows that he's a just god and kind loving god so you need to see him the kind loving one who gave the greatest sacrifice i know i'm not trying to cover up things that were done to you my parents didn't torment me uh but i certainly was picked on and and made fun of most of my life growing up and i just had to let it go i don't even know about losing you know i decided i'm going to let it go and go on i have stuff i have to do and i want to see done you have to make the same decision but let me tell you god does know everything and he is not it is seedtime and harvest people this is not don't get your 50 bottles of anointing oil out okay because this is not the end time harvest it talks about in the bible before all the other stuff start to happen we're not even ready to handle that harvest like that okay you're going to be powerful you're going to be filled with god when those days come but it's a seedtime and harvest for what you've been planting what the left has been planting harvest for them is about to happen what you've been planting by yours making a stand still filled with life encouraging people bringing people hope you're going to get the greatest harvest you've seen in your life so far this is the seedtime and harvest is happening now just that's for free what time is it time and harvest for us individually for whole groups of people if it's evil you're going to get a harvest of justice and and probably the rather that and while while you're talking as this as we close out i know i feel like there's some people out there that says i wish someone would just show me right now how to get saved i i like this stuff no one's ever led me to the lord how do i do that would you i sure would love to do that yeah and and let me tell you it's really uh man can come complicate things so much sometimes we feel like we don't read you know the the 50-page syllabus or if we don't have someone who's like known god forever lead you even a child can lead someone to be born again you make a decision in your own self that you want jesus christ okay you're tired of what you've been living in you're tired of the junk going on in this world you see no hope if you don't have hope right now you may not have a lot of god in you because right now he's releasing hope in life when you are born again literally your your soul gets a shower of the blood of jesus christ to wipe away every sin you've ever committed no matter what it is when it happened in your life if you want to walk as righteous if you don't have jesus christ you're unrighteous okay you're not counted as righteous if you want to be counted as righteous you're going to be part of god's plan what he has in this earth you need to know his son jesus christ you first of all recognize that jesus christ is the son of the living god he did die for your sins and he did it purposefully he chose to do that so the first thing you do is repent of any sin you've ever committed no matter when it happened or how that happened re repent recognize that you are a sinner and you repent and you receive jesus christ as your savior that's the first step that you do that the second step is you thank him for dying for you thank him for your sins being forgiven and it will be like in god's books in heaven when you receive christ he literally will go and wipe out in his books every sin up to that point every one you've ever committed will be wiped off like you never did them that's how powerful the blood of christ is then you say i receive everything that that blood affords me i receive everything that that sacrifice that affords me i realize now i'm part of god's family i'm a part of his family i'm not a i'm not an old sinner set free by grace you are a powerful born again uh believer now jesus christ will literally step inside of you that's what happens he'll step inside of you it says you invite him to live in you and he will and then you begin to feel his presence miraculous things will begin to happen because now you're carrying his presence with you and anytime temptation comes to you after that make sure you say no i'm not that person anymore it says you're born again you are a new creation and the reason why god can say that is none of your past sins you're not being looked at anymore by a sinful person you're being looked at as god's son or his daughter whichever one he made you and now he opens doors for you to understand him more make sure you get a bible i would encourage you to start reading the new testament read the book of john and make sure you study the book of john as a lot about who jesus was also talks about what what it's like to be born again and in in there it's real exciting and then make sure you speak to him you need to know that prayer is very important for you you don't just get you know born again and now i'm saved and live your life like he always lived it i'm not saying you can't stay at the same job or live in the same home you'll have the same family but you need to recognize now you're a new creation made by god because of the blood of christ you begin to seek him and what does that mean get in a room by yourself and say jesus christ i want to know you more i want i want to know you i want to know what your heart is i want to know what your thoughts are of me and i would say i i used to do it at one point every day of my life i did that usually late at night i'm not saying you have to do anything late at night and this is the thing some people say you have to take a certain posture it's okay if you want to kneel to do it you can be walking down the street and get born again you can get born again arriving in your car he's looking to know you more he is seeking you harder than you are seeking him so the most important thing in your life should be to receive christ and then begin to pursue to know him more and then you start on a whole different journey in your life the inside of you has changed your spirit man god puts light in your spirit your spirit man has light in it it gives it more understanding it gives you more of his presence inside of you your name is literally written in the lamb's book of life he'll write it right there at that moment that you get born again and so powerful things happen in the spirit when you are born again so i would just say just you can say a simple prayer so let's just say this you can say jesus christ jesus christ i want to receive you as my savior i want to receive you as my savior i recognize we recognize you are the son of the living god you are the son of the living god you came to this world to die for my sins you came to this world to die for my sins so i repent of all sin so i repent of all sin up to this moment in my life up to this moment in my life i ask you to wash me clean i ask you to wash me clean with your blood with your blood i receive your sacrifice i receive your sacrifice and i now thank you and i now thank you for making me part of the family of god for making me part of the family of god i give you permission i give you permission to speak to me to speak to me whenever you want to whenever you want to i'm going to seek you i'm gonna seek you to know you more to know you more your word says your word says i seek for you with all of my heart if i seek for you with all my heart i will find you i will find you that will be my pursuit that will be my pursuit i celebrate right now i celebrate right now that i have been born again and i've been born again i

upon you during this christmas season so without any further ado let's bring on kat because we have so many wonderful questions i don't want to waste any time so welcome kat hi i'm excited about today's show um and i love your shirt she was showing it to us a little earlier so yes there you are santa and jesus doing selfies in heaven there they go okay it's so it's so cute and so i know everyone's excited about today's episode hearing all about christmas town um but before we start do you have any current events that you want to share with us i just want to say some of the greatest things ever about to happen people um you know i can share but not share all of it i just know that things are rumbling in the undergrounds not just the earthquakes but uh behind the scenes and then covert places the solicitor's covert i can just tell you the new norm will be better than what it was before people it's not gonna we're not gonna be controlled it's not gonna be a time of sorrows we are not entering into the perilous times we have way too much stuff to do in this earth for jesus christ and of course you know this show highlights him also but it highlights one of his best friends in heaven his name would be nicholas so that's about it let's just get going with those questions yes awesome so the first the first thing i want you to just tell like a brief um a little bit about what where christmas tower is and what is christmas town for the people who haven't heard you talk about it before christmas town is actually a place in heaven and for those who don't know me um you you may not be able to wrap your natural mind around anything that i say because it comes by revelation revelation comes from the heart of the father it's not man's thoughts man's ideas are man's plans it's god's and so i've been taking on tours of heaven not just once but many times and before you start you know beating me up i forgive you i forgive everybody out there so don't waste your time doing that i have too much of a life to live for jesus christ but i do want to say this years ago kenneth hagin senior has somebody working for him who actually still on this earth her name is billy brim and um and he would tell billy brim before these days are over uh things that will begin to happen he said i won't be here this kenneth hagin senior speaking to billy brim who worked for him okay and uh and he said to her before these days are all over something great will begin to happen god will begin to catch people up to heaven and taking them on tours really those are his words and then bringing them back to earth this is without dying so they can share revelation about heaven and that he said that to billy brim and when she found out about me she was so excited she called me i sent her my first book i think i sent her the second book too and she said she knew this was true because years ago kenneth hagin senior who's now in heaven uh had told her this would happen and she saw that i was taken on tours continually she knew that was the truth so there's somebody right there who's an eyewitness that god had this plane all along i just happened to be one of those people i've been taking in many places in heaven over the last 20 some years and i was taken to exciting profound places that were so filled with awe and wonder but has also taken places to have fun and the father said to me why would i not have fun if i said in my word you know you must come like a little child he said i'd be in a lot of trouble if i didn't have fun places for people who are like little kids to play in and one of the places i was taken to is a place in heaven where it snows all the time now i know a lot of people are going to love this more will love it than not it snows all the time but you have to remember i'm talking about heaven not the earth the snow is alive everything in heaven has life the plants sing the plants talk the birds the creatures even the buildings shout out the ground shouts out all the time and worships jesus christ they have a place called the friendly forest you can go and have conversations with trees with the rocks uh with the creatures there's so much life there you can't escape it so i hope that under makes you understand in in christmas time when you go there that is where nicholas lives yes nick some people call him saint nick some people come saying you call them whatever his actual name is nicholas and god created a place he knew one day so this place has been around don't go into the druids and all the stuff that it's a bad place and it's part of this thing this thing i'm sorry but god was there heaven was there before anybody was born on the earth he had places already planned in heaven that he knew that we would love to come there and he knew people would come home and use their gifts in heaven which is what you do so nicholas had a place all prepared for him when he passed to come nicholas lived in the 3rd century i think 270 a.d that's really close you know it's only 270 years after christ died so everybody was still talking about him knew about him in those days but of course you know our enemy satan wasn't happy about that so he'd always send people out into the crowds into places to talk against the deity and the person of jesus christ so nicholas was actually this is the person who people then made him become like santa claus he actually was a very wealthy person he lived in turkey you can look all this up even i think wikipedia talks about it he lived in turkey and uh he would offender of the faith and i think he was even a bishop but he was very fierce when people would attack the person of jesus christ or speak against who he was he had a staff he would use that staff for things other than leading his sleigh how about that people he actually had a sleigh he would take gifts to children he used to set them outside their home at that certain time of the year and then thieves would begin to come by and get it so he is the one who actually started the whole stocking thing the parents would hang stockings inside and nicholas would come by and leave gifts for them this is the truth i'm telling you and so all that came the wonderful story we have now but i do want to say this he lives there he loves the snow it's known where he lived on earth and so god created this beautiful place when you make a snowman in christmas town in heaven it is alive so i kind of want some of the christmas songs and the things that they say uh your sleigh can go through through the air it can go on the ground uh there's all kinds of things to enjoy there ice skating and i i learned from the father that our seasons on the earth are here there's four main seasons and we know that there's winter summer spring and fall and god said i took a a shadow of an actual place that existed in heaven i took a shadow of it and made it a season on the earth so that's one of the reasons why we have snow on the earth because it is in heaven it was there first and so he made this beautiful place it's like this beautiful village and everybody goes there with their families who are in heaven and yes everybody gives gifts but then excuse me the main thing they do in christmas town is they celebrate the birth of jesus christ it's like happy birthday all the time in heaven because people go to there to see sometimes jesus will show up and people will bring him gifts they pile gifts gifts you know at a place for him but they get gifts before they leave christmas town because they're huge trees in christmas town and all the lights on the trees are baby stars like that he plucked out of the sky put them on the trees and they all sing worship music to jesus but they also sing christmas songs so this is a delightful place that the kids will love to go but even big kids you know parents and whole families go to this beautiful place and they really enjoy it so that's where nicholas lives he made this place where nicholas has a shop he still makes toys and my brother recently passed and he used to say all the time when i get to heaven one day i'll work with saint nipple guess what he does my brother would create toys on the earth every single christmas he would dress to santa claus he would go give gifts away he'd visit places to be be that person of course the honor of jesus christ in his heart more than anything else and i want you to know nicholas himself loves jesus christ and that's why therefore the shirt you know here's a shirt right here with santa and having doing selfies with jesus and so people people just love some people live in christmas town i mean that's where their mansions are and so it's a really fun exciting place to be wow that's so awesome i can't wait to go and see that myself and all the all the kids questions um i asked i even asked my daughter this morning i knew i was coming on with you and i i said to her her name's lily and i said lily if there's one question you could ask what would you want to ask and she thought for a while she had a couple questions but um michael could you pull up i i put a little video of her asking you uh can we pull that up hey mrs cat um where where is eva's favorite place to go in heaven jesus's favorite place to go in heaven would be christmas town it really is he visits here a lot he actually makes toys with nicholas he goes to his shop because you have to remember jesus was a carpenter on the earth uh when he actually walked on the earth and people go well he built houses he built furniture he made toys too uh jesus loved children you could see all through the new testament that he would be with the little children he said don't keep them from coming to me he loved he loved to talk with him and play with them but he would make toys for them too so guess what he's using his gift he had on the earth in heaven he also loves the snow he loves the beauty of it and everyone loves to see him and they all run want to run up and hug jesus and guess what they take pictures with him in heaven how about that uh they do have a way to do that you think people are taking pictures down to earth where do you get to heaven one day so i would say definitely christmas town is one of his most favorite places oh she's gonna love that um and annabelle is eight she's nine years old and she wants to know if you paint a picture in heaven can you hop right into it and does it become real that's what i remember some of the movies on the years that were made people need to understand all those great movies the decent fun ones a lot of those places are in heaven i'm not going to give you a list of some of those movies but but we all know that there is one that shows something like that happen there's so much creativity and as i said everything alive is in heaven just to give you another idea uh there's a whole place called the galleria where all the artists come now people would think oh you know that would be like rembrandt or somebody like that no anybody in heaven who has a gift you paint or loves to paint there's even a whole section for children and what they paint does come to life now before you think in your natural earth head there's nothing wicked there's no bad there's no witchcraft no darkness no evil none of that is in anything anyone does in heaven it doesn't even exist there so your thoughts your creativity is not ever tied to the darkness so you understand that but fun excitement you know those type of things definitely yes your art would come alive but not only does it come alive there if you are an artist in heaven you have a gallery of your own you have a studio that's part of your mansion people come to get the art you create and you give it away now when they take that art home and hang it on the wall guess what it comes alive oh my god so so she actually thought of something that really does happen in heaven not just in the galleria area where all the artists come but in anybody's home they'll come by no matter what you create or make that's your gift you give it away there's no money everything is given freely but how delightful for somebody maybe sees a magnificent horse picture and they take it home and hang out and all of a sudden that horse is galloping in the picture so yes that is exactly true it does come alive and not only can you jump into your art there's a place called cartoon village in heaven that he also made for children and when you go there you can create cartoon of movies with your friends and then you become a cartoon and you jump in the movie the cartoon and all your friends can come and see and watch it and when it's over you step back up and then you're you again so i'm telling you people that think kevin is boring they don't know very much about it so you were absolutely right yes you can jump into your artwork and then you're there in the art wow oh that's exciting annabelle i know you're going to be excited about that so think about what you're going to draw when you get there annabelle because you're going to be able to to be part of it okay the next question is from evangeline and she's four years old and she says can i have a rainbow house with rainbow things in heaven hi evangeline of course you can it is heaven um mansions are made out of almost anything that you can think of but totally that rainbow comes from the father it's living it moves in and out it's on a lot of places in heaven you yourself can become rainbow color if you want to the clothing you wear changes color so why wouldn't you be able to have a rainbow house i would say yes that would definitely be a yes oh that's that's exciting my daughter's gonna love that too evangeline because she always talks about i want to ride on the rainbow i want to slide on the rainbow and i think i've said in heaven i bet you can that's always how i answer in heaven you can and then michael is age eight this is my son and i asked him to ask you a question and he said can i have a house made out of candy oh no everybody every child wants their house made out candy and the best part is you can eat it and it comes right back uh because it's heaven there's a whole place called jello land in heaven it really does exist and then part of that land of course there's there's houses made out of candy they're made out of all kinds of things uh flowers a whole house made out of flowers and they sing to you all the time when you come to your mansion and uh but candy is one of the most favorite things i know there's chocolate waterfalls probably would be a part of that mansion made out of candy uh you can just go jump out in the waterfall and drink the chocolate or swim in the chocolate and so yes and in the jello lamb part of it people will reach out and they'll take you know a bite of the house or take a handful the house need it then it comes right back you can bounce in the jello land houses also and uh but the candy house i think is a great idea it makes me think of that game candy land so let me tell you i will say this jesus christ does have a soft part in his heart for sweets he loves sweets and so he'd probably be right there with you you know tasting the chocolate or the candy canes or whatever else was made your house was made out of so the answer is absolutely yes you could have a house made out of candy oh well he's gonna be really excited about that because that is his question he's asked me many times cat he said do you think i can have a candy house and i said well with the lord all things are possible so i'm sure yes you can yes that's absolutely true now we're gonna we're gonna move uh now to questions from adults so they're a little different than the kids questions i have i have noticed that um so the first question is from illumination and she actually um is behind the scenes here and she wants to know my grandma went to heaven in 2019 and she absolutely loves christmas even her memorial service was christmas themed is it possible that jesus would give her a home in christmas town because she loved it so much on earth i'm sure he had started building it your your mansion gets started being built when you're born uh when you're born he starts working on okay now in heaven there's no time so it's not like wow was that 10 years 20 30 40 50 years and usually he times you're coming home to heaven with your mansion being done so i promise you he already knew what she loved you know he sees and hears us on the earth i assure you that he had already built that house in christmas town knowing her love for that so if you want to visit her when you get to heaven you will be going to christmas town probably going on sleigh rides she might come to your mention and pick you up in the sleigh and then you can go see her mansion a lot of that type of things happens in heaven so i'm sure yes that she lives in christmas town oh that's awesome well there you go elimination she we talked a little bit behind the scenes and she said i feel like the answer is yes but i i just want to hear from cat what what she has to say about it so paulette is our next question and paulette um asks does heaven celebrate jesus's earthly birthday yes can i hold up something you can zoom in on it and i'm just gonna show them this is a new product not we've already been selling about a hundred so it's not about buying it but i want to show you uh how much they celebrate the birth of christ this is a scene i actually saw in heaven now this is part of the scene i might show you the artwork for the rest of it in a minute but this is a scene in heaven of a little girl uh who lives in heaven and she's riding on a sled with the snowman she built on the front of the sled actually says happy birthday jesus because i had already said that everybody celebrates the birth of christ in heaven and so here they are on their slide you might have to tell me if i can can you see it yes can you see the little the girl the snowman her pet is also there and there it says at the bottom happy birthday jesus so yes they do celebrate the birth of christ in christmastown and uh and everybody loves to come there's one of the reasons they actually do come there they all sing happy birthday to him they have non-stop cake people was gonna get cake in christmas town and hot chocolate you know and and other things like that you're definitely going to experience that but but it is the number one place people would think it would be some other place maybe religious place but nope this is where he chooses and i know people it may not have been exactly december 25th but he loves for people to celebrate his birthday and also created christmas towns so people would be able to go there to do that [Music] and in christmas town today is there um a big christmas dinner uh constance wants to know this and it kind of links with the last question is there a big christmas dinner in heaven for christmas and why do you um we do it on the earth many of the things we actually do and the holidays we celebrate they already celebrate those in heaven and absolutely you're going to eat and people can eat all they want to there's no weight gain no no allergies no food allergies and so absolutely how would that be to celebrate during that time what what represents the time of the year why would there not be a feast yes there is definitely a big feast the good part is this no animals life is taken god makes all the food out of light but it tastes like turkey it tastes like it tastes like ham it tastes like pie whatever you love to eat but they certainly have a a non an ongoing feast in christmas town wow that's awesome i can't wait to eat in heaven i know i've heard you talk about it before about how big also isn't the food really big in size there oh yes like the pizza place that was taken to a place called pizza joe's in heaven and the pizzas were the size of the table it was sitting on now this was a round table this round table will seat about eight people now when i say the word table don't think i'm talking about just a normal table that's not like that it's filled with light and you have like your your plate or you can eat on slides out in front of you and then you just point you you eat a slice of pizza it's about this big i can't even get it i can't even get it the pizza slice is so big you have to hold it with both hands to eat it it was the best tasting pizza i had ever had in my life and right next to that is an italian restaurant where the meatballs are like [Laughter] and the guy who the guy who has that he had an italian restaurant on the earth it was his gift he loved to cook for people he has a chef's hat on he has one of those handlebar mustaches and he's really really happy person so yeah i've been to like an italian restaurant the ice cream parlor oh my goodness the the scoops are this big of the ice cream and you can even create your own kind of ice cream in this ice cream shop and then they change and they add a name to the um the menu up there what you can order and you can you can name the ice cream yourself wow that's so awesome and i know i i love to bake so i'm a big baker and i thought when you talked about christmas town how the artists where um they give away their paintings is it the same with bakeries like we can make really huge christmas cookies and then give them away to all our neighbors oh yes you can they'll probably be lined up outside you can give away your baked goods and i know people they say i don't know what my gift is and yet oh my word they like to make the best brownies on the earth and when are you kidding it's going to be making brownies you know they love to do it they love to give them away as gifts uh people who are blessed on the earth are the ones who who get to operate in their gift now and so uh they they're used to do that but in heaven nobody misses their true destiny god sent us all as a gift with a gift it wasn't not talking about a spiritual group talk about a natural gift that everybody can enjoy and uh and we know people who sing they're singing amazing that's their gift people in sports they play really well that's their gift but there's a lot of other gifts gifts there's like design you know or baking i can tell you that that food and baking and stuff like that is considered an art in heaven that's awesome i can't wait to bake and and i bet the the machinery there is like incredible too like huge mixers times 10. yes it's incred the thing is is now if you want to have a bakery that will be part of your mansion you don't have a place where you live in a place where you work and it's not work when you love it right so you would go to your mansion to visit your bakery and all your good you'd have a showroom with all the food there you had made and yes they do have kitchens in heaven if you want one now if you're gonna be a baker you're gonna have to have a kitchen you probably have people a sign that that's their gift is to help in that um unless it's one of the little tiny angels that looks sort of like an elf and i'm just gonna get bash for that but i don't care uh there are ones that you have little helpers assigned in heaven if you have a bakery because you know you know if you got a half a million people coming to get your goods you need help yes and so it's a whole different life because i've seen the kitchen of someone who loved to feed people her dining room seated 100 people and it was a dining room in her mansion and in her kitchen had such high tech i didn't even know what some of the stuff was this is one of the best parts about heaven if you choose to cook i saw this woman making a massive salad that was going to be served to all of her guests and she was peeling like a cucumber and as she peeled it in the in the and it came off of the cucumber it disappeared there's no waste there's no trash there's no cleanup how about that isn't that awesome hallelujah there's no cleanup no garbage to take out people there's there's no waste dumps and having to leave stuff it just disappears and um that's like back to the waterfall chocolate waterfalls you can get in and swim around you have chocolate all over you but when you step out of it it's gone so but the food thing in heaven just amazed me that everything you eat is made out of life but your substance i know people think well light is something you can't really touch or feel and heaven it is it's the number one thing that things are made out of in heaven actually your spirit man is made out of light but you don't float around like a little cloud in heaven you walk on the streets you use your stuff in your mansion you ride the horses uh it's an actual life it's a literal life in heaven wow that's awesome well i'm excited to go and cook in heaven i'm telling you that i've had that deep within me where i'm like i can't wait to cook and bake and give away my stuff in heaven because that is your visit your place yes please do please everybody come visit me please okay um elaine elaine wants to know can you describe how jesus became a seed and was planted in the womb of young mary that's awesome there's actually a story the holy spirit told me one time it's called twas the year before christmas and i'm just going to share a little part of it i'll probably have it printed out later on there but it starts like twas the year before christmas when all through father's house every creature was stirring yes even the mouse there was so much activity like uh maybe um earth time a year before that when it was being announced that the word who was christ in heaven the word was going to be sent to earth as a baby to be raised up to walk among the people here and then one day would give himself for them so i don't know if people even think about this they think well they're just supernatural they just fly around do whatever they want to do oh no there's much planning in heaven and explaining in heaven because you have to understand the angels were there long before we were put on the earth and so there was all kinds of activity in heaven all the time they'd be sent on assignments places throughout the cosmos and things so much activity going on in heaven because people were on the earth you know people were living on the earth at the time christ was born and so the father had to take the word and explain to him this is the plan this is the plan i have for you you will have flesh on you number one the word was all spirit but like i explained in heaven that's like a whole different realm the spiritual realm to a spiritual person would be literal like i'm touching this like i'm holding this cup right here see in heaven if you had something to drink uh you would also touch the cup and drink out of it even though it's a spiritual world uh it still had life and activity and there was building going on plans being made talking about people who had just come home to heaven people getting to greet them so but heaven does like to have a lot of celebrations so this was a different time when the father called the word to see him and explained to him talked to him he said would you be willing to do this he asked him we know it was it was at that time it was a father the word and holy spirit and when the father would want to create something when there was nothing he would go somewhere where there was nothing he would speak what he wanted the word would step out of him and you have to understand in the spiritual world the father the father son holy spirit can step inside of each other that's what makes them one the three in one so they would go places together and i'm thinking the word probably thought oh we're going to go create something but the father took him aside and explained to him it's time now for hope to come to the earth and therefore my plan is to send you as a baby to be a baby on you to be raised by a wonderful mom and then one day you would grow up and then you would give yourself for the sins of the world and i'm quite sure because i know we think well they know everything the father really does know everything because everything comes from him and this was his plan for man to help man to help man on the earth they needed help okay uh the enemy who satan was wreaking havoc everywhere he was just getting people to fall into darkness and the answer was to send the light of the world which was jesus christ so he did explain to him he said i will take you and i will make you into a seed and holy spirit will take you down to the earth hover over mary and plant you in the womb of mary and i know people don't think about this too much when they just read the word but you should really study the word it says in there that he was planted in this as a seed in mary and later because we know man carries a seed i won't get into all that normally the man carries a seed and then you get married then you have children but this was totally different uh this was a supernatural divine thing that happened that the father took the word who was his son made him into a seed the holy spirit hovered over the womb of mary and even talks about it in the bible and then she he was he was planted as a seed grew up in mary was burst into the earth as a real being he had flesh on him okay why did he have to have flesh so that people could see him because on the earth normally you don't see spiritual beings unless god opens your eyes to that spirit realm which is also all around us so he had to explain not only to him what he was going to do he had to take all the tribes of angels and explain to them this is what is going to happen it's going to be different now it'll be different because redemption is coming to mankind the word has said yes he's willing to do this and then he will be known on the earth as my son who one day will give himself they were totally they were undone because this was something that had never happened before i know when new things happen on the earth people think oh that couldn't happen or that won't happen but you know heaven has been through many things like we have there was even there was kind of war one time in heaven that was when satan tried to take over and he was kicked out in a lightning bolt uh so they've experienced that all of that happening so this was new news even for them a new revelation so now the word was being sent to the earth would be not not recognized on the earth because when he was the word he was a spiritual body and he's going to have flesh on him so he'll look different and they could watch from having to see everything going on so yes on that beautiful morning nine months after the holy spirit hovered over mary and planted that seed uh jesus christ and then he was born into this earth such a celebration in heaven took place um that the host came in saying to the shepherds gabriel came to announce his birth i'm sure there was quite a sight uh you know here on the earth to see this all this activity going on it was very major for the father to give his son as a gift to this world and that's why god loves it when we give gifts just so you realize christmas time on the earth is so precious to god it represents us loving one another giving gifts to each other helping each other you know making a difference bringing hope when christ came as that child he began to bring hope to people everything was going to change about when you pass from this earth you could go back home to heaven having received christ as your savior so this is one of the best gifts ever given to the earth would be jesus christ the son of the living god and he was raised just like you and i had to be a little baby learn to walk and learn to read and write and i do know this about jesus he loved reading when he was being schooled on the earth he didn't care too much about writing and i love the holy spirit he said that's why there's only 10 commandments instead of 20 because he didn't care too much about writing that's a joke in case you didn't get it so anyway the star coming several years before the birth of christ that the wise men came across the deserts and some people see them in a little play here's the three kings they were from different countries they saw the star of christ in the east so they traveled east from the desert regions from three different countries it took them two years to cross those deserts to come and bring the gifts to to to jesus and i don't know that he was living in the manger at that time they did come to honor him recognize who he was so even people on in other countries knew something special had happened and so from that point on jesus lived his life walked out his life on this earth so that he could become our sacrifice and what he was doing was making a way back to the father so i will say this the day you pass and you step out of this body and you're going home to heaven jesus will come get you he's the one who walks you up the steps of the throne and says look father your if your son or daughter your son or your daughter whichever one is has come home to you that's part of the blessing that christ gets for having given himself for so but it was all a stir in heaven all these people these these creatures and these angels and the host of heaven the army they were all talking back and forth non-stop did you hear the words going to go to earth did you hear he's going to be a baby uh that sounds to them that was like sort of wild but they knew when the father said something it was going to happen so all of heaven prepared for this to happen things were repaired on the earth people were put in place there would be a part of this whole story of his birth how they had to travel they were told they had to travel to uh you know be accountable for who they were and register and that happened to be in bethlehem how about that and god had already placed his star in the heavens to be seen uh two years before this happened so that's the true story of why we celebrate this time of the year is because we celebrate the birth of jesus christ who came for us because he loved us the father loved us the holy spirit loved us and this is their plan for you for i for every person in the earth god desires that none should perish but you have to choose jesus christ to live in this beautiful place this world called heaven that is the father's house that's beautiful when you talk about jesus walking us up the stairs back to the father i mean that touches my heart so deeply because it's i can just imagine that and the beauty of seeing the father and just the love that must come and washed over you as you're with jesus and seeing the thought oh i just can't wait for that day oh you're already undone that that jesus christ is with you you hear about him people have encounters sometimes i already got the spirit of god all over me right now you hear stories of people encountering him on the earth and i can say i have seen him many times but it is never normal i'm so undone every time consumed by the love that just comes from him it it just permeates every part of your body and you forget about every care you have you're not you're not listening so much to all the stuff going on right now in this world god has a plan for this world okay it says the earth is the lord's and the fullness thereof this earth belongs to jesus christ he paid a price for it and he knows what's going on let me tell you there's stuff that's going to be exposed i can just say get ready for some great great days ahead no matter what the enemy thinks they're going to do god has a plan to be in some of the greatest days if you're young you have the most powerful amazing future ever on the earth to do great things for him the creativity will be so powerful and amazing people will be shocked some of the stuff will be created on the earth to help us our life to be better and and happier but the number one thing that will happen is the presence of the lord is about to consume this whole earth and the knowledge of that glory will be seen and known all over the earth hallelujah i feel i feel that so strong when you talk about that it's it's going to be an awesome time it's awesome time to be alive uh there was some there's someone who asked a question about i wanted to find it real quick because they asked about the oh the shepherds here we go sally asked about um what happened to the shepherds to whom the angels appeared 30 years later did they connect with jesus um the baby they had seen or did they always wonder what happened to that baby have you seen any of those shepherds in heaven um i'm sure the shepherds made it happen i will tell you this they never forgot what they saw i mean here is one of the one one of the archangels appearing and gabriel is beautiful he's so glorious i'm sure the sky lit up you know the sky open person lit up and here he's given this glorious announcement you know that this messiah is being born the son of god has come to be amongst mankind and i can tell you that i will say this too that where it talks about the great host appeared the ones that sang were actually part of the army of heaven okay and you know it says in the bible that the shepherds were afraid they were so afraid that their body hurt now they weren't going to be hurt but they'd never seen anything like this so you can imagine warring angels coming with gabriel to sing and to glorify christ's birth on the earth that's actually what actually happened and so they were singing i'm sure it was really loud but it was beautiful and so you think you saw just one angel you'd never forget it but here you've seen multitudes of the these armies of heaven and gabriel and the seraphim probably were there singing their heads are like blue fire blue fire their hair is so can you imagine this site and i know no one has been there and has not seen it doesn't understand i was taken back and i actually saw that scene i saw what happened because he was using the army of heaven and i'm like no wonder no wonder no for me because i see i'm a seer i see the army of heaven around me all the time i see their activities i see them you know battling the army of darkness and how badly they get beat the army of darkness gets beat but so i'm i was accustomed to seeing them but seeing the sight the shepherds were cowering behind rocks or bushes their eyes were so wide you know here's gabriel making this beautiful announcement and then here comes the army to sing in the heavens and and it's the lights just like blinding from there so you can imagine they probably repeated that story over and over again to everybody they knew probably they probably didn't believe it but it didn't matter to them when you have an encounter you never forget it so i'm quite sure because jesus did teach over in that region he taught over there there was jerusalem and other places there i'm sure some of the shepherds probably eventually lived in um in jerusalem i mean it wasn't that many years now he was in there he was already known as a great carpenter joseph taught him as a master carpenter so jesus was known as the carpenter the son of joseph but we know he was the son of god uh so he was known because of that but but when jesus turned 30 he began his public ministry that means he started demonstrating the miracles the signs and wonders and i'm quite sure it made it back to the ears of those because this spread far and wide that said i'm sure that some of those who were in bethlehem or maybe relooking in jerusalem they probably knew exactly who that was when he started talking about being the son of god i i'm quite sure that there are some of those shepherds are in heaven yes wow that's awesome i i can imagine that you went got actually got to go back and see that whole entire scene that's incredible oh my god i can so if when i get to go to heaven can i go to a place to watch that scene too yes actually there is a place they have um they actually have theaters in heaven how about that now again i have to always explain you don't have to have ratings like r for rotten pg like partly good g for good uh you know i mean they actually they they know what goes on here so any of the theaters in heaven again there's no darkness there's not going to be profanity there's no no uh you know killings none of that no violence whatsoever so there's no dark witchcraft none of that is in the theaters in heaven but they have a place where you can go uh and you can actually watch when god made when they made the earth you actually get to see him creating earth by watching it but it's not like a screen it's like you're there wow oh my gosh i can't i cannot wait for that um there's another question about um renee asked this question and i've heard a few people ask this question before um i'm seeing a lot of christians fighting about celebrating or not christmas is that a spirit of religion trying to stop the celebration of christ's birth i think it's partly that i think it's partly what we've been taught our whole lives in church you know depending on the church you go to because you know there can be 50 churches to probably hundreds of thousands of churches right now and i tell you i tell people no matter what church you go to make sure they're teaching about the validity of jesus christ who he is he's the only way to heaven i think it was that but i think totally satan any chance satan god to draw people away from the truth that's the bottom line satan doesn't want people to have fun joy celebration but he does not want them to have the truth because the truth sets you free so okay this place in heaven was created before the earth was here so you can't say that christmas is some pagan holiday sorry people okay the pagans weren't here when god made it in heaven however there is someone who lived in heaven saw all the beauty the wonder and the fun and when he was thrown out of heaven he created wicked evil things and said that was his symbol that was his celebration their lies i'm not saying there weren't these wicked groups on the earth doing things but satan stole different things in heaven to make them look like they were bad so christmas town belongs to god he decided to create it no human hands made that place because it's a place of fun of splendor a place to celebrate his son it's in heaven he loves it when we celebrate it on the earth and you know what you all need to go get can you get me the dvd real quick jen i'm going to show you really quick a dvd i would encourage everyone to get and watch with your family it's called saving christmas it's right there by kirk cameron actually got really tired of listening to the very thing you're talking about he got tired of all the insults and and and dragging you know christmas down saying it's a pagan you shouldn't have nothing to do with it so he went to the word of god got all the scriptures and wrote this script for this movie called saving christmas it is hilarious but it actually shows you nicholas back in the time when he walked down the earth where that came from and he actually explains why christmas is so important on the earth like i said it's the only time some people forgive each other it's the one time they reach out and give to help others even people they don't know and we watch this many times and so i'm just going to show you the cover i already heard from kirk cameron's people saying thank you for showing it it explains everything and i think you can get it on amazon is that where you got it janet amazon so i'm going to share with you right now here it is it's called saving christmas by kirk cameron and he explains why the christmas tree is important are the all the balls the lights on the tree what they represent and you know representing christ even things like the nutcracker what that represents for for heaven for heaven on the earth and why do we eat why do we celebrate what does all this mean and he shoots down every myth or reality of what evil has tried to take over he explains it the best of anyone i've ever heard so i will encourage people get that dvd let let yourself watch it with you and your in your family it's the best explanation i've heard i can just say christmas even now people are having more hope than they've had in like almost two years uh hope is flooding joyous flooding through celebration i know most people pitch or sell heaven is nothing but a place where you bow down to god all the time part of the way we worship in heaven is enjoying things he put there that's our gratefulness for what he gave us even in heaven so heaven celebrates it doesn't have funerals there's no funerals there's no firing squads there's no death certificates being made out no one's crying no one's grieving in heaven it is a celebration of what christ did for us by coming to this earth walking as a man showing you the right way to live what righteousness is what unrighteousness is but i can tell you what there is a copycat enemy our true enemy enemy is satan i know he uses wicked people to do things and then he makes up all these occults and all these things i don't even understand don't care about because i'm not a part of that and i choose not to participate or read it or watch it i feel myself with the light of god with his word what his plans are but i can tell you christmas has always had the presence of god on it when you attend church celebrating the birth of christ the choir singing represents the angels that sang on the day of his birth of some of the most glorious songs ever made or created were ones about christmas because in those songs many of them talk about oh holy night hearts and heart the herald angels sing and so all these beautiful things came out of this one beautiful holiday it's more than a holiday it's actually a way of life that's what it is so yes i celebrate it i will celebrate it now i will celebrate in heaven one day it brings families together but the gift giving is one of the big things i know man has commercialized it and i'm not saying you know go go get a gift for somebody it's a wonderful beautiful thing to do maybe help the poor with something you know that's one of my favorite things to do also but christmas is dear to the father's heart he made it not a pagan not some satanic group even satan didn't make it he just tried to steal it and he lost amen and what this is a perfect this is a perfect question to go along with what you just said um there's the user it says username because i'm happy they asked a question um what can we give jesus for his birthday to show him we love and honor him i'm gonna move my scarf over there yo i would say he loves cards and uh what i do if i want to make a card out for jesus i actually make one out to him and i put it on my tree i mean you don't need to put it even in a card you can make him one i would say he loves the kids to draw pictures you know maybe christmas trees or gifts or something like that just telling him that you love him thank him for coming to earth to be the way to make a way back to the father he loves it when we sing christmas carols especially ones that talk about the holy night and away in the manger he loves and actually watches many of the events put on by churches or groups that show that scene back in the way back in the day when christ was born and they have someone be mary and joseph and baby jesus and then they show you know if they're really big ones they bring live animals in but he lost to see the celebration in our heart so i would say the best gift you could give him would be celebrate the holiday help people love them and remember why we celebrate it it is about funny gifts and you know the joy but number one it's about a child being born in the manger a king the king of this world who created everything we see and everything we touch and he's very much a lie right now excited about this time of the year so i'd say make a little note telling him that drawing a little picture hang it on your tree if i was a parent i would save those somewhere in a special box one day and say this is what you did to celebrate our king jesus oh that's beautiful uh there brandon wants to know is there spiritual significance when people here on earth light up their homes with christmas lights do people in heaven light up their mansion in a similar fashion for the sake of christmas they have lights everywhere i can tell you if you think that you've been driven somewhere where they have a lot of decorations and things everywhere in christmas town even outside of christmas town they all have some kind of lights because it's celebrating when the angels came and the sky lit up with the glory of heaven that's actually what those lights represent that's what they like they represent on your tree on your home you're making a statement i celebrate the birth of jesus christ i celebrate with him in my life that i belong to him and i'm recognizing that i'm standing with the promises he gave me so i would say definitely put lights up we put lights everywhere we can uh the other thing one more thing in the and jesus just said to me now that sounds wild he said don't forget the cake it is celebrating my birthday why not make a cake and eat it so i can come and see you eating the cake we actually make a birthday cake for jesus on christmas and at our christmas dinner we have a birthday cake for jesus and we sing happy birthday to him even though he doesn't need to have that done he loves it so don't forget to have cake or cupcakes or something that your children can be a part of and celebrate with him at a time when he had to change his whole life and even who he was just to come to this earth for us so we can sing happy birthday to jesus on christmas and make that part of our family tradition with our kids so that they're always raised knowing that it is that's why we celebrate that's a great idea to do that as a family for all you moms with young kids that's a great idea we did that growing up and now we still do it even now we still do it so definitely you're recognizing him you're you're honoring him by recognizing him that he is so special he's worth making a cake for besides like i said he loves sweets i didn't get to finish that when jesus was growing up as a child he loved honeycomb it was his favorite thing it talked about it in the bible him and honey but john the baptist his cousin also ate honey and it was the sweet of that time that would be like eating cake you know in this day and he still loves sweets and every time some new baker comes home to heaven he's going to visit their shop uh he loves his squeezing he'll probably visit you if you make sweet sweet i was just making a half cake have cake and celebrate the birth of christ oh that's awesome well we have one i think we can get through one more question um christine asked my dad went to be with god recently and he loved to feed god's cardinals my dad loved how the snow and the cardinals looked would my dad be feeding the birds in christmas town or are they all over heaven birds are all over heaven but i have seen i don't know why they just look so beautiful people make ornaments with the red cardinals and i think i know they're around normally other times of the year but i just think they're represented if you look at i got probably probably 20 christmas cards at least that had red cardinals on them i'm not kidding like with the tree with the snow and everything in it i'm sure there are birds there because the birds come to sing happy birthday to jesus too and so the birds will come in they'll go out they'll come in but i have seen red cardinals in heaven uh in christmas town and other types of birds too but i'm sure that they will be able to see birds in that place singing to jesus oh that's beautiful well thank cat for all the questions today i mean they were they were some awesome questions when i was reading through them i was like oh my gosh these are all you guys did an awesome job sending in christmas time questions i enjoyed each and every one of them so will you just pray for us real quick before we end uh this time together and just bless everybody that's listening sure um i was gonna show one more picture and this represents sort of like the army of heaven coming with gabriel making the announcement um this is the star right here if you can see if i can hold it right i'll put the star you see the star or not yes is it right side up yeah there's the star of bethlehem there's gabriel making the announcement but the army that's with him is not normal and you can see some of them look like creatures and they're singing so the shepherds would be down on the ground you know trying to go like oh my gosh what is that and what is that up there in the sky uh whenever it says host uh in the bible they're talking about the army of heaven and so uh yes many of them came to sing because you have to remember jesus name was the lord of hosts so this was his army coming to sing about his birth on the earth along with gabriel and so i had to show that real quick picture but i will pray father i thank you right now for blessing everybody in this wonderful time this wonderful season on the earth god don't let legalism and religious mindsets set into people that they don't think you should celebrate it's not about fun it totally has always been about fun the sacrifice of your son was one part of his life but his birth was totally different great celebrations were taking place in heaven even mary and joseph and those who were present with him they were celebrating and knowing he was the son of god coming to this to this earth so father i thank you that the reality and the presence of jesus christ will flood everyone's home everyone's person at this time of the year god let love consume any fears any concerns about any cares you know jesus came to take them away i thank you for recognizing his birth recognizing who he is but also remember the celebration part that they celebrate in heaven on earth as it is in heaven thank you god for blessing each and every person if they lost something let it be given back to them seven times over as your as your as one of your followers i thank you that we're entering into a holy season of the glory being released in the earth thank you for giving us a measure but right now let sometimes their house light up without any lights on it let the light of god come over their face father it says that we will shine like the stars in the heavens i thank you that we're here for a reason we were sent that our birth was timed on the earth to be here right now to bring hope and life and joy may the season be filled with people relationships being restored uh homes being given father stuff being redeemed for people this is the time of year you love you chose for your son to come to this earth and god the date and the day is not important the recognition of it is so father let people let go of things they need to let go and enjoy this time celebrate this time that's what you would want them to do so i just impart that to them right now the life of god the love of god the plans of god to walk in this earth to bring hope and help and healing in the name of jesus for jesus with jesus because of jesus it's all about him amen amen amen how can people get a hold of you cat if they want to follow you um i know we have your
