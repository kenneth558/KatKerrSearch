well merry christmas everybody it's december 15 wednesday december 15 2021 welcome to the broadcast this is the next to the last cat curve broadcast uh for this year and then of course we pick it right back up next year uh by the way uh i'm i'm going to say this before i forget to make the announcement because i think or written at my note i might forget if i don't say it you know we have cats we have questions for cat already for today so we don't need those uh our staff decided it would be great to have you ask any and all kinds of questions about christmas as it relates to heaven or whatever cat knows is seeing understands so ask your questions about christmas for next week's broadcast most of the people put those questions underneath the youtube not in the chat to the right but underneath uh where you put your comments where they stay there not the ones that just disappear and roll off the screen um and there are other ways we get them too some people have hit reply and do different things that our preferred method is below youtube um and we'll try and look at other places as well but that's we're going to tell you that specific one so i want to thank everybody for your amazing donations yesterday we pretty much had an unprecedented number of donations and we really appreciate that this ministry is really growing by leaps and bounds uh after the first we've got several more people we'll be bringing on board in fact we'll make those announcements at the right time just a few of those we will announce like this i think that some of you have seen illumination who now works for us we we got her by making the announcement on the air so we will be making some announcements uh either next week or after the first i'll see what the staff wants to do and then people can then begin to send those in so we'll figure out how to do that and give you an address or email whatever the staff wants and we'll tell you which positions we're looking for so but anyway thank you very much for your generosity i know it's the as you we approach the year end many of you are trying to to determine what you want to do with your what things you want to do with your um final giving for the year we certainly appreciate you thinking about us you know i've said that we've built uh we've dug seven wells in uganda and and then we've doubled the size we paid for the construction of doubling the size of the health clinic on in that ugandan village i haven't even shown you that picture yet uh we have to work we're committed to do 24 to dig 24 new wells in and around that community and region and some of you who saw that video we'll show it several more times you saw that the people were drinking some of them when the water is running off of the piglet tree into the water that they they put in their drinking water and they bring it home it's just a horrific thing so we're digging freshwater wells thank you so much for your i i would say your help you know it's not just you helped us you did it it was your income that brought that money in and we sent it to mike and laurie sally of show mercy some of you want to check their ministry out show mercy.org they are in uganda so mike and laurie sally dear friends of ours we've known him for about 15 years they're doing a bang-up job out there and so we're we're going to do at least 24 or more wells next year we will probably increase that i feel like the lord's showing us that we'll increase that number significantly and maybe there'll be other areas we don't know but right now uganda's our is our place anyway thank you for that get your questions about christmas remember that if if you get kicked off this is why you need to be subscribed here so we've got your email address and can send you uh notices wherever we go i mean what if we're going to different things we are live today on facebook live youtube live live and elijahstreams.com live so we're live in four places so if we get knocked off and one um we'll be in those other three so um i think that's it all right let's bring in kat kerr here hello everybody how you doing good good to see you merry christmas to you yeah merry christmas so you're going to ask we're going to ask a whole lot of christmas questions next week you probably heard that and we want to have you just elaborate on what you talked about christmas town all that so i'll have you just kind of elaborate on that next week so well yeah that'll be fun so listen um we'll just jump in um before we have any questions cat what kind of anything current events you'd like to share uh well i do there are there are things out there everybody knows about and things people can't know about right now but i i can continue to tell you that that foundation of the left is crumbling um there's other people leaving their positions because they're being exposed in that is privately that i can't announce who that is but that big support this is the thing when you lose your support like you were saying you can't do anything that is absolutely true but guess what it's also true for the left all the people who are jumping on that bandwagon are jumping off many of them are jumping off some of those are really big supporters and i can tell you bottom line why i can tell you why they want to have money left over because they keep being asked for more and more and more you can't give yourself to something that is totally darkness and think they're going to let you go how about if i give you that as a tip you can't do it you can run in and agree and participate with things that are evil and think that will let you go i can also tell a story about that there are people who were part of an extreme dark uh uh thing that was going on this is probably maybe 15 years ago and they actually had seen demons talk to demons and not trying to scare anybody they gave permission they gave permission and they thought what they got to do was exciting and amazing but guess what they wouldn't let them go they tormented them for the next 10 years of their life and and they just couldn't get rid of they didn't get rid of them because you can't give yourself to something it's like what god says what you enter into will enter into you and that's how simply something that's one liners of some of the most powerful things he ever says to me but what you choose to enter into will enter into your soul that's just what happens and either you think about it you want to run after it or else you give them a tie to you and these people actually gave a tie to to this these beings that were um beginning to torment them when they were done with the fun thing they thought they were going to be a part of which was dark was really bad i'm not going to tell you what that was but they couldn't get rid of them finally they had to repent and and cleanse their soul and every every place they lived they had a place that the demons would always come in at night and torment him they couldn't do anything about it so they had somebody get hold of me i didn't meet with them i told them what they would have to do and they could never ever go to that place again and they would have to just you know make sure that they got that out of their soul number one but they actually had to renounce anything or any hold or tie that darkness have with them that they gave permission to that's the difference and people who are just maybe attacked every now and then that's it that's illegal that's taken to the course of heaven sometimes and sometimes god just comes in supernaturally and ends that that's like an attack this is not what these people were doing they willingly participated in these evil acts that were happening somewhere and that's why it took longer to get rid of it they finally broke it they have had no no nothing else come they stopped coming they severed that tie they severed that portal that was open by their own repentance and then um having to take communion over the whole thing and you know what they attempted to come back but they said they couldn't they served only the living god they would not serve the enemy again so that's why it's so important to make sure you never get into one of those places or participate like that it's really hard to get rid of and that's what people are finding out now who already have been a part of this thing this year and a half long thing that's been going on in our country more and more people think i can make money if i let them use me for this or if i lie about this or if i cheat in this way i'll make money well they're finding out they're losing their money that's what's happening they're losing their money and once they make a tie or a contract with this darkness that's going on they won't let you go that's why you don't want to participate in the beginning you stand strong against everything that's going on you keep running after god right now in your life and don't forget to celebrate he's still saying that to me god has already seen the beginning to the end he knows exactly what will happen and i know there's a lot of theories and assumptions and people think they know what's going to happen i can tell you god is going to decide when that does happen when it does it will be so great you won't have to wonder if you'll hear about it so this is just a tip to people or those who are still in the darkness you better get out while you can if you don't you probably will lose everything because this is an evil thing happening in our country you cannot steal a country you cannot give yourself to satan or his evil ex and think he will let go of you if you're already stepping outside of that maybe you never got born again you better get bored again really quick i will say that you better get born again because that's probably the one thing that can save you from all the stuff you've been involved in but there's already people they've already got some people who are being witnesses um to a lot of these accounts that excuse me that are happening so i would just encourage you and i'm gonna keep doing it get out of that darkness while you can repent make sure you make sure you tell somebody who is accountable who is an authority in the area that's just looking to see what's going on so i just want to encourage people those things are happening right now people are uh they're distancing themselves from some people they're actually getting out of these things themselves but people who have money are finding that if something doesn't happen to stop this whole thing they themselves will have no money or property so let me tell you evil will never bless you evil can't create life or hope or something that's going to help there is no help in evil and darkness that comes from god that comes from belonging to jesus christ so all you who've been out there have been strong and stayed strong and given hope to people that that god does know what's going on don't give up okay you got to stay strong it says making your stand and standing there for us i just want to applaud you yeah yeah making a great stand for jesus christ he made everything we know and see nothing is hidden from him so if you think because god's not saying anything right now to everybody that does not mean he doesn't he does have a plan he he does he does have a plan for all of this that's good ken i think you said something a minute ago and i thought you know i'm going to ask her to expound on that you said people had sold out to darkness and you got them into repentance and to receiving the lord if they hadn't but then you said they took communion over that thing or something to the that effect and you're you're speaking about communion as if it's a weapon and let me just ask you to expand uh expound on the weapon of communion what does that actually do when people take communion it is so powerful and unfortunately most churches has just become a tradition yeah i will give you a good example of that i remember where i was attending at one time it had become like a tradition that doesn't make god very happy because there is power in the blood of jesus christ and his surrender totally to the father's will and even his own willingness to do he didn't have to do anything at the cross and no matter what people think don't take the crosses off your wall now that you think he's not on it anymore his own personal mark he makes as a carpenter is a cross that's what he does even in heaven when he makes things that is significant it means everything to all those who are a believer who have received the the sacrifice that christ did and died for us he shed his own blood for us that is a powerful thing in the spirit it breaks things sometimes that nothing else can and especially people if they've had things going on in their house at night maybe they may be familiar spirits or other kind of spirits if there's nothing else you can do you've prayed maybe you've fasted you need to take communion yourself over your property and then you go outside and you pour some on the land and say with the blood of jesus christ i redeem this land a shockwave of jesus christ will it tell you it will embed itself in the property you're living on and then you invite holy spirit to invade it just invite the spirit of god to invade it and let me tell you what it'll be hard for anything spiritually bad or evil to come on that property it would be too painful for them taking communion is something some people actually do every day and i do it about once a month myself at least sometimes more than that and recently we just cleansed our land again and let me tell you what the peace of god with the presence of god will infuse that the presence of god is in communion it represents many things it represents the sec reminds us of the sacrifice christ did but it's something that brings us together if you do that with your family it will be so powerful in the spirit it brings a bond with you and your family together when you take that together recognizing together as a family what christ did for you sometimes it opens things you never could get open sometimes it breaks the power of the enemy that nothing else will break i even tell people who've been sick for a long time you should be taking communion over your body it says very clearly in the bible what you know what he did by his stripes what does it say you are healed okay the blood it helps your mind and your mental faculties it just does physically mentally and emotionally it can heal things and break things off of you that never could be broken off before wow that's my you know my spiritual father wade taylor last five years of his life he was my spiritual father he would take communion every single day and i believe he sometimes several times today his and his he believed that the lord had shown him that the closest thing we have you know the tree of life isn't on the earth right now he he strong strongly believed that the taking communion was the closest thing we had to a tree of life on the earth as far as the natural you know elements that type of thing is interesting you know and he was a very healthy man until you know finally it was his time and suddenly he was gone but uh yeah that was i i've never looked at communion the same since he since he said that because i thought you know that what if he's true what if it's true that there's so much more healing available to us there is you know and i remember at least i was in at the time that they had just did it they were doing it again just as a rope thing as a just a normal thing they did once a month and god yelled from heaven to me it is holy it is holy it is holy and i'm telling you the presence of god fell so strong on me he said you will say something about this and so i wrote all this down i gave it to uh one of the prophets visiting visiting and uh they read it to the congregation like a week later they read it and the power of god fell on the entire church and people actually got on their knees and repented for not taking it for the full uh the power of god that was in it the fullness of his sacrifices in there well what what did he represent he represented life hope joy healing empowerment that's what's in that's what's in taking communion that's what that means that's profound i mean it's just so profound yeah when i was raised up but i'll get into these questions here when i was raised in a fundamental church it was like every 13 weeks we had a communion they even did the foot washing with it and all that but it was like if we could figure out a way to get out of that particular uh church service and stay home and once in a while we'd figure out something like let's go to the beach today it was it was just a ritual there was no power in it and we just looked for ways to get out boy i would never do that you know with my understanding it's very powerful here's here's the first question um this is a two-part i'll just read them both but my mother was in her last days in the hospital in hospice she kept telling me about these beautiful atriums she kept seeing i personally believe god was showing her glimpses of heaven before she passed so question when are there atriums in heaven and two does god reveal heaven to people in their last hours or moments to comfort them or to prepare them before they die um well that the last part is absolutely true some people it's their first glimpse of not just having many people in their last maybe maybe the last week especially they'll begin to see family members who are in heaven they'll just see their faces or something sometimes they might hear them say something that's not like they're going to abide there with them but he is letting them have glimpses of having something else they'll see many times are their own angels or or they'll just see angels in the room that's really a clue that they're probably not going to stay very long and but if everything jesus christ unless they walk up and he walks up to him and say you know you will live and not die or it's not your time but sometimes he'll catch them up there and tell them there and then send them back but if if they begin to tell you that i've seen jesus then that either means they're going to be fully healed or they're going to be fully healed by going to heaven and uh so yes a lot of that happens sometimes you'll give them glimpses of mansions in heaven or the streets of gold or even the throne sometimes so that is absolutely that part's absolutely true i think because their spiritual body is getting more aware and um even when it gets close to them stepping out and they literally step out of their body that's what they do if they're sitting up naturally they'll just step right out of their the physical body it'll fall back but there they are right there looking at their own body that's happened to a lot of people and then jesus would say it's not your time so they have to go back in wow there are many different things that could happen some people were here heavenly choir saying that part is very true and uh and i'll tell us i'll talk about something else in a minute about the choirs but that is true and yes uh even sometimes when people are really sick maybe they're not terminal they will see glimpses of places in heaven and i believe the atrium thing that they're seeing is probably some beautiful part of the gardens of heaven uh there's a friendly forest in heaven they have beautiful gardens surrounding that there's a butterfly there's like this beautiful meadow where butterflies are uh they actually will sing you hear them singing so they could hear a heaven part of heaven singing they could see angels i could see family members there and that does bring peace to them and sometimes not just peace some people get really excited when they when they have glimpses of heaven like that that's amazing well that's it's encouraging because as i said the number of times my mom's real close i'm kind of curious by the way regarding that now my mom's memory is going we just got back from ohio she's got now she doesn't remember from conversation to conversation a few minutes late does god let me ask it this way does god have a harder time getting a hold of someone like that who needs a little bit more of him or does he have an easier time because she's tuned out of life what would that be like for her to maybe i think it wouldn't matter what state they're in mentally emotionally or physically when he wants to make himself known or let them begin many times if we're saying they feel no matter where they are on their path if they belong to him it he already has that connection with them in their spirit when he's ready to show them something he's going to do it but normally that will begin to change that person and even if they can't remember what they ate the day before who visit them the day before they normally will not forget if they begin to have encounters and sometimes it's not like a face-to-face encounter sometimes it's his presence uh sometimes they they may say oh i feel really good right now i i feel amazing i feel such peace on me that's usually because christ could be in that room with them right there in that moment i just know that sometimes it might be a little bit easier in my thinking if your natural mind begins to shut down or your memory system the reason for that is they can't remember the things that they were angry about they can't remember things you know they can't remember their cares they can't remember their concerns they don't remember any things that were said to them or maybe things that they did that they shouldn't have you know maybe unkind words that's gone from them so that does totally open it up for the lord to begin to either speak to them or begin to show them things so this that might be a good thing well you know it's interesting you would say that i wasn't going to share this but you know my life's an open book right now but you know what what's that you love it it's so open because every millions are white i know well we went out in march and i i was thinking i was being a good dutiful obedient loving son to offer her to come and live with us from ohio and boy oh heck broke liz and i understand this is this is really what happens to a lot of seniors at this age they if you think if they're thinking you're taking their blasted i mean she didn't say any bad words but she was furious he was okay so now fast forward we just can't went out there in ohio and we were itching her along and then she called me after we we got back and and she's now she's inviting herself to live with me instead of the other i said i said well mom you you know after you treated me so horribly and she goes what are you talking about and she made me repeat it five times and she didn't even remember after five seconds after i told her she said now tell me again what i did then we found out later she doesn't even remember any of us flying out there during march yeah that does that actually doesn't happen as part of the process of just being prepared many times just to just to leave um but that's normal and you're right that's very normal and even most people when they of course if they're still around here around a heaven uh a hundred years old you you should see some of them some of them are sharp as attack but in the natural most people's bodies and their systems and the way they operate their thinking it kind of begins to shut down some uh they may be alert in every other way but their memory from like the day before whatever like she was saying to you that might be god's blessing sometimes because like you said she didn't remember even saying that yeah it feels like well i had i had actually been again here's that open book thing i was really wounded i was hurt and i kind of cared that i kept forgetting her in my heart all this time after i found out yesterday that she has no recollection i'm thinking what what how what purpose would it be to even have any hurt left what have i heard about something that she has no recollection of ever doing so it's like it just fell off it just fell off it's almost like maybe a child does something not to hurt you on purpose but it just happens you know and uh especially in the different growing years they might say something hurtful teenagers do that sometimes and it it it's part of their growing the young on the young side but when they're older it's just part of what's natural and i think that is i know people who've forgotten that went through traumas and stuff not not my family of other people had horrible traumas when they got closer to that age they didn't even remember it it's like it just naturally left them and they're happy i've also known people who like almost couldn't stand being around somebody and now they love them it's the same same people but but they really love them because the person who was holding that was gone because the memory part was gone so yes steve you can't you can't hold it against somebody who to them like well that never happened i would never say that they mean to you i never said that yeah i mean i was smarting and i can't you know i was you were hurting that hurt so anyway that's good all right here we go he goes i'm i'm finding out that my seven-year-old son is a seer what is your number one piece of advice for a young seer for their parents his sister has an autoimmune issue and he said that once while we were praying for her healing he looked up and saw a small angel about four inches tall with wings wearing a red dress with her hand on my daughter's foot praying for her would that have been her guardian angel that my son saw or a different one sent for specific purpose so it's kind of a multi-part there that probably would be a different one sent for a specific purpose but since you brought that whole thing up i i have known families who had a child who was handicapped in some way they get extra angels assigned to them just because of that what we would call a disability uh they get extra ones assigned to them and this young man now is so almost absolutely normal he has some physical things not causing him pain but growing up they said he wouldn't live they said he would never have a normal mind he would never be able to talk never feed himself and this was being fed to this young child's parents like their whole life they refused to accept that they made sure he had everybody the care that he had but they talked to him normal they didn't treat him like there's something wrong with him and he has two angels that are with him all the time besides his guardian angel and they're there because of this this handicap thing he has like i said this is like 30 years later and you know to see him he's so filled with the light of god he's a believer and he's such a testimony to people because of how he has grown in every way that the doctor said he wouldn't be alive but there were two angels assigned to him and i knew somebody else who had someone who was grown and they also had two other angels and finally i just asked holy spirit why are those other angels with him they looked different than from their guardian angels and they said oh they're sent to they they like protect the anointing that they carry they're there just to be uh yeah to bring things down from heaven to them that god wants to put into them i'm pretty certain that's what that four inch angel was that was like a little messenger angel bringing something down they wouldn't be part of the host but they probably were brought down from heaven with one of the hosts probably brought them down there so that was great as far as being a seer i would get a journal most important to write down things that he's seeing it's really important that they do that when he gets older he'll be very grateful for that journal uh like right the day what he said he saw just write in his words what he said and then anytime he comes i've already told some of my my daughters to make sure that they do that and so one of them has actually started cataloging and now this child is 10 and he's not stopped seeing things but it's very powerful to him that he can read about the things he said that he heard said or that he saw so definitely most important thing you can do is uh no matter what god ends up by doing with that gift he has it will be very powerful one day make sure you're writing it down yeah and what what's the deal with the four inch angel versus a seven foot angel i mean what would you say about that i would say possibly whatever it is that the child is um whatever it was you said that they had it probably there may be like a tribe of those little angels like that made for that specific thing that they were diagnosed with and that maybe that may be something that god sends maybe his life is in them they're they're probably putting the life of god in them oh the peace of god in them so that would be their only assignment that would be what they would be sent for probably to keep that child in peace or the presence of god yeah i guess the issue was it was she just said it was an autoimmune issue so she didn't say that so okay melanie asked how old does god look how old would we perceive him to be in earthly terms i've heard you describe kind of seeing his face but i've also heard you describe almost a little bit of a veil so i mean how do you see him you and i talked on the cruise that one time and i said are you telling me cat that you're sitting down sitting down talking face to face with the god of the whole cosmos and you just like yeah you know that should be crazy it would be like asking that question to a child that really saw something let's say your child went and saw somebody or met somebody and you maybe try to convince them i don't think you saw them they would be so adamant uh that the child like part of me there's nothing in me that could make up anything he wouldn't use me at all if he if if i did that i i'm a detailed person so i'm always going to see details one of the reasons why i see him clearly is he chose me because i have a photographic memory and i am a detailed person like i'm not going to hear just a sentence that he says i i'm taking places that i have to remember all that i saw and then they have to write that down if it's things that god came and told me personally and he said i want you to i want you to share this with people then i have to remember exactly what he said it's not like it becomes um familiar in any way i won't even use that term because the power uh the power he carries i'm sure he has to probably uh maybe minimize that a little bit just for me to be able to be around him i probably i sometimes i feel like when i'm when i'm seeing him and it's just to be in his presence i feel like i'm going to melt and go inside of him i don't know how to yeah outs to explain that the love that comes from him is so powerful and it's it's not just what i feel his appearance is quite striking if i could say that you feel life coming from him because it did we all lived there so it's like he's holding everything in him all of time is in him he didn't appear somewhere time came from him and i know i i love the one-liners he tells me to tell people they get their heads so undone they try to wrap their head around it but most of these things are spiritually um discerned i would say in his normal appearance because i've seen him like a certain way many times then there's times i've seen him with flames of fire with lightning bolts shooting out of him when he's walking against the darkness and stuff like that his own appearance begins to change it talks about the wrath of god and any believer you should know this that we are not appointed under that wrath that he was demonstrating that would be evil in darkness and wickedness that he despises evil he despise what it does to people so if he was gonna catch me up there and talk about the justice that is coming then his whole appearance would be to bring justice that would show me that that fierce side of him okay the loving father side of him which is what i see many times i know his hair is made out of light remember the father is all spiritual but he still has the ability to hold me if he wants to or i can just stand next to him i can see into his eyes and usually they're like blue flames of fire they're they look blue to me blue flames of fire but what comes out of him if you could picture um i love the northern lights i've not seen them in person but i've seen god and that's what that rainbow looks like coming out of him if you ever wondered it's not a stagnant rainbow it's not like you could just paint it around him and it would just be there and not have life and movement and i would have to say seeing the northern lights in the way that they move like this coming out of him continually and on these waves of his rainbow which he it comes from him no man made the rainbow people it comes from the living god it's part of his own appearance and his person and out of that comes these little spirits of life they'll ride on this rainbow then ride back in him that's what you used to do when you lived inside god it says in him we live we move we have our very being the prophets and poets of old have spoken of these things what things when they were shown that way in the past god would show himself to people sometimes and sometimes it was someone who was a poet and they actually wrote poems about that and so one of those made it in the word of god so that's just a part of him to see him like that the creative side where i would see jesus step out of the father and the father would say something and then he would make what he said that's why he was called the word we know in the book of john it says that we know in the book of john when john said the word was with god and was god and there was nothing that was made that was not made by him that was jesus christ that's who he the word came to the earth and died uh as the son of god and so they're one and the same the word jesus christ are the same but when he was the word he only had a spiritual body he was all spirit it was still a body i know in your mind you can't imagine you think of something like a little like a spirit like whatever you want to call it like the spirit of a person or something they're much more there's much more to them than just some little wispy thing if you're in a spirit world which heaven is and everyone there in the spiritual body they look solid in that world okay so when i see the father most of the time he looks like he's solid although he's all spirit so i've seen him with love coming out that consumes like the whole army of god before they're going to go somewhere um to bring justice for him over someone on the earth he'll literally go and just stand in their midst and every one of them will be permeated with his love he loves them too and his love and and just empowerment and and when you see that he's he is kind and he is good and many people don't see the father is good but jesus himself said there's none good but the father and so when you see there's many different parts of him sides of him uh that's who he is but i i'm always undone when he comes most of the time unannounced because what is on his heart to share i'm i'm his revelator that's what he calls me that means i reveal for him i don't reveal for a man so i'm not gonna usually i can answer questions ask me if i've been told or shown it otherwise i can't answer that i can't answer for him if i haven't been shown or told something so it's really quite undone sometimes the room i'm in like where i sleep which is in my office built this moment there's a huge portal in that room and and sometimes he would come down through that portal but sometimes most likely in the hotel room a lot of times he'll just walk through the wall like it's not there and he'll begin to tell me stuff sometimes he'll tell me to write it down sometimes he'll write on the wall and we know that even in the word of god it talks about him doing these things so for him those are normal things he does when he when he knows somebody who's going to tell the truth who will not embellish on what he what he said which is extremely significant even john the baptist had one of the greatest revelations ever given on the earth that's why they said he's the greatest prophet of all that's why that's in there he announced literally here is the son of god he actually got to say that even though in the natural he was jesus's cousin when he spoke those words he wasn't speaking from a natural viewpoint he was speaking from a divine point and he never changed as much as that he came that he came to say that you had to repent of your sins right he was one of the first ones to give that message so what he said was so powerful when he actually said here he is uh the the first and only person on the earth who could actually say here's jesus christ the son of the living god this is the messiah that was a powerful word but he never changed what he said because that's what god told him to say wow yeah and you've always been obedient that way you know almost to a frustrating point because people will ask you something i've seen it even on um what's the kenneth copeland channel i can't think of any victory channel or whatever and flashpoint and they'll try to get you to answer a question you'll say i can only tell you what god told me and then he'll launch into your prophecy that was that's pretty i've learned learned a good way um also that's part of that same question is does god the father does he look like a grandpa does he look like a dad who's older what what age impression when he leaves well i know you're wanting most people will judge somebody by their skin okay or conditioning is a skin and does it have wrinkles does it not have wrinkles does it have like brown spots and most people judge people nor in the natural you know um if they have white hair no hair i mean i i can't answer him in that context i cannot put him in a category as a human i know that i see life in him i see still even now talking you can still see his face very clearly and it's filled with life there's no age in him he's never going to age his hair is white it's alive his hair on his head is living it's not short hair it's down below his shoulders uh he has this amazing uh wonderful beard um it just you know i can't i tell people say what do you think he looks like kenny rogers he doesn't look like a human everyone fails in comparison to him because of the stuff he carries that makes him who he is but i can just say that you will you'll never regret giving yourself to his son that is the one where you are assured of meeting him in person he's excited about seeing you he cannot wait for you to get back home to heaven and i hope this gives you a glimpse of the other side of dying for you you're losing something for him he's gaining something he's gaining his son or his daughter back to himself he is so excited all of heaven celebrates when they come home so for them there's there's there's no loss in their mind uh from the time they step out of the spiritual body they're stepping right there they feel his presence they see their angels their excitement floods them you know i mean it's not like they don't love you to actually love you even more but but just to be in his presence i understand why jesus when he had to live on the earth he'd go away to the mountains to to be with his father he would go away to go be that he needed it after living here with humans are you kidding and so king himself loves the father and i think for him the greatest thing he gets to do is take us back to him when you come home to heaven he walks you up the steps of god's throne the father's throne and gives you back to him he says your son your daughter they've come home and let me tell you the celebration will start in heaven at that time but but he is not little he's not a little person in any way whatsoever but this is what i love about the father one of the greatest things i like to say about him is he could be a hundred feet tall two thousand feet tall whatever he wants to be he can be that size i think sitting on the throne many times and to me he would look like maybe i don't know 10 15 feet high he he doesn't want to make himself invisible to you if you're coming home to meet him but i've seen him holding the earth in his hands so i hope you get this picture i've seen him back in time when he was making the earth holding it in his hand this is the father when the word would step out he'd make it gave it to the father the father began to speak over the earth itself he would pour water from himself he's going to put the water on the earth he poured from his own south the river of the river of life that comes from him he poured that in as the ocean on the earth and so whatever they did they did together and so i've seen him that big to hold the earth in his hand i've seen him be you know make himself well call enormous eyes just to hold you he'll stand up on the throne and hold you to himself and i also know this about him that even though he's on the throne he himself can make himself not leaving the throne small enough to step inside of himself to play with all the little spirits of life that's who you were are you serious with you in himself while he's sitting on the throne people he knows what's going on if you think he's willing to give this earth that he loved that he spoke over to evil what do you think he didn't have and he kicked it out it got unseated lost his place lost his authority lost his power lucifer did you think he's changed his mind about that because he has not he loves you too much and this time is too important for him to give it over to evil all i know is they're going to lay down roll over and beg god for mercy when those days of justice fall upon them and for some of them it will be too late wow wow catboy the anointing hit you right there god came god came down wow wildcat cat let me can i explore a little bit you talk about the son loves the fat father loves his son and son loves the father i think we've talked about this a little bit let me drill down you know when i was raised up we'd always make sure we pray in the name of jesus make sure you say the name of jesus and it became like a a formulaic word make sure you mention the name of jesus because then god can has to do it but but is there something in when we pray in the name of jesus that we should at that moment almost tap into how much the father loves jesus as we're saying that as opposed to just making sure you pronounce jesus or yeshua what what is that go ahead and understand who you're talking about when you use this name uh and if if there's probably if you're saying it just from head knowledge this is what you want to know don't ever say his name from head knowledge okay you need to say it from revelation like what i just spoke okay that's how you should feel every time you say his name for any purpose you're having power in that name of jesus that's why it is one of your greatest weapons the name of the name of christ okay his name his blood uh his sacrifice his revelation of who he is he right now he right now is the king of glory people uh he has many other titles besides jesus christ when you talk about him as your savior and what he did for you he also gave you power over all the power of the enemy he gave us three things you see him from that viewpoint it should almost be like a threat to hell that you are saying the name of jesus christ wow wow yeah that's a whole lot different well that's what the lord's been showing me lately is is to tap into to that to him to the reality um yeah and this one you kind of answered this this is the next question but you kind of addressed this it says before jesus came to the earth and he was called the word in heaven did his spiritual body then look like what we know as his human body or what we think of as his human body or was his body more like i don't know what i don't know what this means was his body more like the holy spirit i i think this person's grasping between um a cloud like the holy spirit or the body of jesus but i i think they both have um a spiritual butt right yeah i would say when you are you talking about let me get the timing right are they talking about what jesus looked like when he stepped out of his physical body let me see when jesus came to the earth and he was called the word in heaven he was called the word did his spiritual body then in heaven look the same as his human body looked on earth oh when he was the word did it look the same as the physical body on earth that seemed to be the question no physical body changed him from what he looked like because if it looked just like the word why did not satan recognize him oh good point oh good point he did not know when he took him to the mountain temptation that was the son of the living god he didn't know that he was trying to find out who he was he was always pursuing who is he until he himself said who he was he did not know he did not know he was the word that was with god the word was all spiritual body that was his divine body a spiritual body a spiritual body like we were just talking about isn't a wispy cloud i know what they're talking about you're talking about what they've seen on tv or movies this little wispy thing steps out they can go through walls and the reason why uh your spiritual body down here could walk through a wall is that physical wall is a temporary substance it's even a temporary realm the physical realm is not the original realm the spiritual realm where the whole world called heaven was created where tribes of angels were made where you go back home to live in that place you don't pass to the walls in heaven and your spiritual body okay you have substance in your spiritual body but as far as the appearance thing the word was very powerful he could go in and out wherever he wanted to do whatever he wanted to he had no flesh attached to him the other sacrifice you don't realize he made was he was willing not just to walk and live in a physical body he had to keep the physical body wow and so when your little spirit person leaves god when you lived in god you didn't look like this okay you had a little appearance you had a face you little face you had body you could play inside of god and the river of life climbed the mountain that's in him a ride in and out on the waves of the rainbow you could do those things in your little spiritual body but you didn't look this gave you an identity okay that's one of the reasons why he wanted you to have a fleshly body number one so you could live in this physical body in this physical world and do things for him here but as opposed to the word the word look different than jesus christ did because the flesh wrapped around your spiritual body your spiritual body actually adapts to the flesh because when your throat man steps out of this body when mine does it looks the same as if i was in my fleshly body except i look a whole lot younger and so were you one day so know that satan did not recognize who jesus christ was he didn't know he was the word okay who made him actually uh satan was created he's a created being he didn't know that that was the word he didn't know at all and that that was part of the bushwhack people so that was part of the butch whack that jesus would almost have a disguise that satan wouldn't recognize for a very long time jesus could do things he wanted to say what he wanted to and and satan i'm sure was quite shocked when jesus christ you know living on the earth began to cast demons out of things that really freaked him out i'm really sure now he said okay this person's got power he's got power i i don't didn't know he had this power uh and he's not really as brilliant as he wants people to think he is because when he got kicked out the heaven part of his mind was seared by that lightning bolt i'm just letting you know so he did not know that that jesus christ was the word of god because jesus himself with his fleshly body looked different than the word and right now he still looks like jesus christ who lived and walked on the earth except for this he has his glorified body already he was glorified that body was glorified when he stepped up from hell came up from hell and stepped into that physical body that was dead laying on that slab life infused it but not just life but the glory of god infused the body of jesus christ and he walks around now in his physical glorified body in heaven so when he comes to see me that's that's who i see is the one in the glorified body and you know when you said uh this is the first time it ever clicked that we would have looked different inside the father because we would only look like we looked down because i'm a combination of my mother and my father that's the appearance i took on that's right because i had a natural mother father so i don't look totally different in heaven before god selected the family for me i guess yes he knew all along he knew you would be looking like just like you do now steve he knew everybody would be looking like that like they do right now in their physical body he knew when you were in him you were chosen at that point for some things in your life he put a little mark on you he knew i would be a prophet he knew you would make a home for the prophets to come and say whatever god wanted to say he knew that we probably knew each other we probably were friends inside of him that would be cool to know that would be really interesting you think so we wouldn't be doing so because i know those who were friends inside of god if he chose you to be a part of your lifetime uh in a significant way he would absolutely choose people that kids that you were like call them kids they all little they're all little at all like a bunch of little kids living in him and and you had i would see little kids sometimes with little groups playing with each other and doing things with each other and we we can have a whole whole just segment about life and god uh really that would be quite fascinating to find out revelation about what did you do in there what went on there what does it look like and there's another whole thing but i'm pretty sure that we probably were friends i know my husband and i were friends when we were we were part of this the little group that we had uh inside god that we played there's millions inside of him but there's no back to god there's no size to god it's like inside of him he's part of infinity and that at one time you know before he made the earth we all everyone who ever was or will be lived in him you can imagine in your head let's hope you maybe that makes you realize how powerful he is about who he is uh he is limitless in his understanding and his knowledge and in his revelation he's unlimited in almost every way he's unlimited can i ask you a a difficult question that some watching will even um it would be their question it would be their question god knew you before you were born he knew what you would look like before you were born and then there are people who are product of of either born out of wedlock in some cases rape how do you what do you say to people who say but what about me how could god have known me and allowed me to either have children of abuse or what do you say about the plan of god and what sometimes we're allowed to go through in this life i think one day when you get your book given to you that was written about you in heaven you'll understand that he didn't choose any of the evil stuff at all that wasn't had nothing to do with god at all he sent us to this earth it's an imperfect earth there's imperfect people everybody is held accountable for what they did they they there there will be an accountability uh of course when you receive jesus christ that has something to do with wiping that away but i can tell you this he sent you this is what happened he picked you for certain things he sent you to earth at the time he needed you to be here he didn't choose those people to be wicked they weren't always wicked when they were children they weren't wicked okay so everybody making their own choices are raising their children in a certain way because of what's in them and that's why i always i talk to young people a lot i've done young people meetings and i say you have to understand that you're not just going to be raising children one day you are shaping souls that came from god for his use do not be abusive i'm i'm telling them this already but you know what that's if they watch a lot of violent stuff just go into their soul and even psychiatrists know this they don't understand the workings of the soul or what the soul looks like but what you what you choose what you listen to all the time will become a part of you what you watch all the time would become a part of me and eventually you might even act out some of those things you see and that's why there's evil satan helps that to happen he makes sure it happen happens and yet there's some people who grew up in a violent household that that never part part took of that they they were strong they never allowed that to affect their life or how they lived it later and became and were totally totally different people than what that person was that had them so you have to understand god didn't create he didn't make evil happen he didn't even make lucifer satan if you go back that far let's go that far he may lucifer to be an anointed being who would help lead worship for him to create glory for him to be a light for him that's what that's what lucifer's job was he made him for that he didn't make him to be evil it says in the bible iniquity was found in him that was significantly because god didn't put that in him okay by his own thoughts by lucifer's own thoughts and own wicked desires to be greater than god and want to rule from that came evil began to be birthed inside of him before it came out so because there is evil present in this world one day there won't be any we can look at it that way but god didn't choose you to be tormented he didn't choose that those people who raised you had every right to choose to do what was right regardless of what within them they had every right to be kind to you to nourish you to nurture you and everything and know god and no happiness and joy and not have your mind tormented later in your life all the things that happened to you as a child but god didn't create evil in this earth he didn't know evil would be here but he also sent his son for the very purpose that you could be free from anything you went through you can be free from any event no matter how bad it was or when it happened you don't have to carry that stuff on the inside of you and that's why he came to bring freedom in life he had an appointed time to be here even jesus christ had to be made into a seed this is what it says christ was made into a seed he was made okay he had he was going to have flesh on him and i think on my our next um report we do i'll actually read the poem holy spirit gave me about when the announcements began to made it be made in heaven that the word would die for us that the word would be made flesh which it says in the bible he was planted as a seed in the womb of mary but there's this whole beautiful story it's called the year before christmas and what literally began to happen in heaven um you know before he was even sent and i'm not going to do that today but we'll do that next week but you have to understand god has been from the beginning to the end and no matter what you thought you could do that would be better he has a plan he was willing to sacrifice his own son who was tormented and tortured and so horribly abused wrongfully accused uh you know unjustly treated and and basically murdered he knew that his son would go through that but what comes from that and this is the thing you even though it's not god's intention to make you suffer for him his son suffered for all of us you can take your life no matter what you've been through and you can lose all of that all of that horror all of that abuse all that torment all that trauma lucifer from your soul in jesus name and jesus will come pull it out of you and it will be like it didn't happen in other words you might think about it but there'll be no torment in it there'll be no suffering in it because we can be totally free from all of the effects of evil but god didn't make people bad he didn't make evil itself and the evil one who's done this will be more tormented than anything that ever existed throughout all the time he satan will be more tormented than any other anyone else who ends up in that lake of fire satan will be the most hated being in there the most tormented and he will have no power whatsoever so you can think of it's one thing you to be in a place of torment but when you everyone is tormenting that one person and they can't escape or get away uh that is his end he will have nothing from anything he's done god also knows that he's a just god and kind loving god so you need to see him the kind loving one who gave the greatest sacrifice i know i'm not trying to cover up things that were done to you my parents didn't torment me uh but i certainly was picked on and and made fun of most of my life growing up and i just had to let it go i don't even know about losing you know i decided i'm going to let it go and go on i have stuff i have to do and i want to see done you have to make the same decision but let me tell you god does know everything and he is not it is seedtime and harvest people this is not don't get your 50 bottles of anointing oil out okay because this is not the end time harvest it talks about in the bible before all the other stuff start to happen we're not even ready to handle that harvest like that okay you're going to be powerful you're going to be filled with god when those days come but it's a seedtime and harvest for what you've been planting what the left has been planting harvest for them is about to happen what you've been planting by yours making a stand still filled with life encouraging people bringing people hope you're going to get the greatest harvest you've seen in your life so far this is the seedtime and harvest is happening now just that's for free what time is it time and harvest for us individually for whole groups of people if it's evil you're going to get a harvest of justice and and probably the rather that and while while you're talking as this as we close out i know i feel like there's some people out there that says i wish someone would just show me right now how to get saved i i like this stuff no one's ever led me to the lord how do i do that would you i sure would love to do that yeah and and let me tell you it's really uh man can come complicate things so much sometimes we feel like we don't read you know the the 50-page syllabus or if we don't have someone who's like known god forever lead you even a child can lead someone to be born again you make a decision in your own self that you want jesus christ okay you're tired of what you've been living in you're tired of the junk going on in this world you see no hope if you don't have hope right now you may not have a lot of god in you because right now he's releasing hope in life when you are born again literally your your soul gets a shower of the blood of jesus christ to wipe away every sin you've ever committed no matter what it is when it happened in your life if you want to walk as righteous if you don't have jesus christ you're unrighteous okay you're not counted as righteous if you want to be counted as righteous you're going to be part of god's plan what he has in this earth you need to know his son jesus christ you first of all recognize that jesus christ is the son of the living god he did die for your sins and he did it purposefully he chose to do that so the first thing you do is repent of any sin you've ever committed no matter when it happened or how that happened re repent recognize that you are a sinner and you repent and you receive jesus christ as your savior that's the first step that you do that the second step is you thank him for dying for you thank him for your sins being forgiven and it will be like in god's books in heaven when you receive christ he literally will go and wipe out in his books every sin up to that point every one you've ever committed will be wiped off like you never did them that's how powerful the blood of christ is then you say i receive everything that that blood affords me i receive everything that that sacrifice that affords me i realize now i'm part of god's family i'm a part of his family i'm not a i'm not an old sinner set free by grace you are a powerful born again uh believer now jesus christ will literally step inside of you that's what happens he'll step inside of you it says you invite him to live in you and he will and then you begin to feel his presence miraculous things will begin to happen because now you're carrying his presence with you and anytime temptation comes to you after that make sure you say no i'm not that person anymore it says you're born again you are a new creation and the reason why god can say that is none of your past sins you're not being looked at anymore by a sinful person you're being looked at as god's son or his daughter whichever one he made you and now he opens doors for you to understand him more make sure you get a bible i would encourage you to start reading the new testament read the book of john and make sure you study the book of john as a lot about who jesus was also talks about what what it's like to be born again and in in there it's real exciting and then make sure you speak to him you need to know that prayer is very important for you you don't just get you know born again and now i'm saved and live your life like he always lived it i'm not saying you can't stay at the same job or live in the same home you'll have the same family but you need to recognize now you're a new creation made by god because of the blood of christ you begin to seek him and what does that mean get in a room by yourself and say jesus christ i want to know you more i want i want to know you i want to know what your heart is i want to know what your thoughts are of me and i would say i i used to do it at one point every day of my life i did that usually late at night i'm not saying you have to do anything late at night and this is the thing some people say you have to take a certain posture it's okay if you want to kneel to do it you can be walking down the street and get born again you can get born again arriving in your car he's looking to know you more he is seeking you harder than you are seeking him so the most important thing in your life should be to receive christ and then begin to pursue to know him more and then you start on a whole different journey in your life the inside of you has changed your spirit man god puts light in your spirit your spirit man has light in it it gives it more understanding it gives you more of his presence inside of you your name is literally written in the lamb's book of life he'll write it right there at that moment that you get born again and so powerful things happen in the spirit when you are born again so i would just say just you can say a simple prayer so let's just say this you can say jesus christ jesus christ i want to receive you as my savior i want to receive you as my savior i recognize we recognize you are the son of the living god you are the son of the living god you came to this world to die for my sins you came to this world to die for my sins so i repent of all sin so i repent of all sin up to this moment in my life up to this moment in my life i ask you to wash me clean i ask you to wash me clean with your blood with your blood i receive your sacrifice i receive your sacrifice and i now thank you and i now thank you for making me part of the family of god for making me part of the family of god i give you permission i give you permission to speak to me to speak to me whenever you want to whenever you want to i'm going to seek you i'm gonna seek you to know you more to know you more your word says your word says i seek for you with all of my heart if i seek for you with all my heart i will find you i will find you that will be my pursuit that will be my pursuit i celebrate right now i celebrate right now that i have been born again and i've been born again i

upon you during this christmas season so without any further ado let's bring on kat because we have so many wonderful questions i don't want to waste any time so welcome kat hi i'm excited about today's show um and i love your shirt she was showing it to us a little earlier so yes there you are santa and jesus doing selfies in heaven there they go okay it's so it's so cute and so i know everyone's excited about today's episode hearing all about christmas town um but before we start do you have any current events that you want to share with us i just want to say some of the greatest things ever about to happen people um you know i can share but not share all of it i just know that things are rumbling in the undergrounds not just the earthquakes but uh behind the scenes and then covert places the solicitor's covert i can just tell you the new norm will be better than what it was before people it's not gonna we're not gonna be controlled it's not gonna be a time of sorrows we are not entering into the perilous times we have way too much stuff to do in this earth for jesus christ and of course you know this show highlights him also but it highlights one of his best friends in heaven his name would be nicholas so that's about it let's just get going with those questions yes awesome so the first the first thing i want you to just tell like a brief um a little bit about what where christmas tower is and what is christmas town for the people who haven't heard you talk about it before christmas town is actually a place in heaven and for those who don't know me um you you may not be able to wrap your natural mind around anything that i say because it comes by revelation revelation comes from the heart of the father it's not man's thoughts man's ideas are man's plans it's god's and so i've been taking on tours of heaven not just once but many times and before you start you know beating me up i forgive you i forgive everybody out there so don't waste your time doing that i have too much of a life to live for jesus christ but i do want to say this years ago kenneth hagin senior has somebody working for him who actually still on this earth her name is billy brim and um and he would tell billy brim before these days are over uh things that will begin to happen he said i won't be here this kenneth hagin senior speaking to billy brim who worked for him okay and uh and he said to her before these days are all over something great will begin to happen god will begin to catch people up to heaven and taking them on tours really those are his words and then bringing them back to earth this is without dying so they can share revelation about heaven and that he said that to billy brim and when she found out about me she was so excited she called me i sent her my first book i think i sent her the second book too and she said she knew this was true because years ago kenneth hagin senior who's now in heaven uh had told her this would happen and she saw that i was taken on tours continually she knew that was the truth so there's somebody right there who's an eyewitness that god had this plane all along i just happened to be one of those people i've been taking in many places in heaven over the last 20 some years and i was taken to exciting profound places that were so filled with awe and wonder but has also taken places to have fun and the father said to me why would i not have fun if i said in my word you know you must come like a little child he said i'd be in a lot of trouble if i didn't have fun places for people who are like little kids to play in and one of the places i was taken to is a place in heaven where it snows all the time now i know a lot of people are going to love this more will love it than not it snows all the time but you have to remember i'm talking about heaven not the earth the snow is alive everything in heaven has life the plants sing the plants talk the birds the creatures even the buildings shout out the ground shouts out all the time and worships jesus christ they have a place called the friendly forest you can go and have conversations with trees with the rocks uh with the creatures there's so much life there you can't escape it so i hope that under makes you understand in in christmas time when you go there that is where nicholas lives yes nick some people call him saint nick some people come saying you call them whatever his actual name is nicholas and god created a place he knew one day so this place has been around don't go into the druids and all the stuff that it's a bad place and it's part of this thing this thing i'm sorry but god was there heaven was there before anybody was born on the earth he had places already planned in heaven that he knew that we would love to come there and he knew people would come home and use their gifts in heaven which is what you do so nicholas had a place all prepared for him when he passed to come nicholas lived in the 3rd century i think 270 a.d that's really close you know it's only 270 years after christ died so everybody was still talking about him knew about him in those days but of course you know our enemy satan wasn't happy about that so he'd always send people out into the crowds into places to talk against the deity and the person of jesus christ so nicholas was actually this is the person who people then made him become like santa claus he actually was a very wealthy person he lived in turkey you can look all this up even i think wikipedia talks about it he lived in turkey and uh he would offender of the faith and i think he was even a bishop but he was very fierce when people would attack the person of jesus christ or speak against who he was he had a staff he would use that staff for things other than leading his sleigh how about that people he actually had a sleigh he would take gifts to children he used to set them outside their home at that certain time of the year and then thieves would begin to come by and get it so he is the one who actually started the whole stocking thing the parents would hang stockings inside and nicholas would come by and leave gifts for them this is the truth i'm telling you and so all that came the wonderful story we have now but i do want to say this he lives there he loves the snow it's known where he lived on earth and so god created this beautiful place when you make a snowman in christmas town in heaven it is alive so i kind of want some of the christmas songs and the things that they say uh your sleigh can go through through the air it can go on the ground uh there's all kinds of things to enjoy there ice skating and i i learned from the father that our seasons on the earth are here there's four main seasons and we know that there's winter summer spring and fall and god said i took a a shadow of an actual place that existed in heaven i took a shadow of it and made it a season on the earth so that's one of the reasons why we have snow on the earth because it is in heaven it was there first and so he made this beautiful place it's like this beautiful village and everybody goes there with their families who are in heaven and yes everybody gives gifts but then excuse me the main thing they do in christmas town is they celebrate the birth of jesus christ it's like happy birthday all the time in heaven because people go to there to see sometimes jesus will show up and people will bring him gifts they pile gifts gifts you know at a place for him but they get gifts before they leave christmas town because they're huge trees in christmas town and all the lights on the trees are baby stars like that he plucked out of the sky put them on the trees and they all sing worship music to jesus but they also sing christmas songs so this is a delightful place that the kids will love to go but even big kids you know parents and whole families go to this beautiful place and they really enjoy it so that's where nicholas lives he made this place where nicholas has a shop he still makes toys and my brother recently passed and he used to say all the time when i get to heaven one day i'll work with saint nipple guess what he does my brother would create toys on the earth every single christmas he would dress to santa claus he would go give gifts away he'd visit places to be be that person of course the honor of jesus christ in his heart more than anything else and i want you to know nicholas himself loves jesus christ and that's why therefore the shirt you know here's a shirt right here with santa and having doing selfies with jesus and so people people just love some people live in christmas town i mean that's where their mansions are and so it's a really fun exciting place to be wow that's so awesome i can't wait to go and see that myself and all the all the kids questions um i asked i even asked my daughter this morning i knew i was coming on with you and i i said to her her name's lily and i said lily if there's one question you could ask what would you want to ask and she thought for a while she had a couple questions but um michael could you pull up i i put a little video of her asking you uh can we pull that up hey mrs cat um where where is eva's favorite place to go in heaven jesus's favorite place to go in heaven would be christmas town it really is he visits here a lot he actually makes toys with nicholas he goes to his shop because you have to remember jesus was a carpenter on the earth uh when he actually walked on the earth and people go well he built houses he built furniture he made toys too uh jesus loved children you could see all through the new testament that he would be with the little children he said don't keep them from coming to me he loved he loved to talk with him and play with them but he would make toys for them too so guess what he's using his gift he had on the earth in heaven he also loves the snow he loves the beauty of it and everyone loves to see him and they all run want to run up and hug jesus and guess what they take pictures with him in heaven how about that uh they do have a way to do that you think people are taking pictures down to earth where do you get to heaven one day so i would say definitely christmas town is one of his most favorite places oh she's gonna love that um and annabelle is eight she's nine years old and she wants to know if you paint a picture in heaven can you hop right into it and does it become real that's what i remember some of the movies on the years that were made people need to understand all those great movies the decent fun ones a lot of those places are in heaven i'm not going to give you a list of some of those movies but but we all know that there is one that shows something like that happen there's so much creativity and as i said everything alive is in heaven just to give you another idea uh there's a whole place called the galleria where all the artists come now people would think oh you know that would be like rembrandt or somebody like that no anybody in heaven who has a gift you paint or loves to paint there's even a whole section for children and what they paint does come to life now before you think in your natural earth head there's nothing wicked there's no bad there's no witchcraft no darkness no evil none of that is in anything anyone does in heaven it doesn't even exist there so your thoughts your creativity is not ever tied to the darkness so you understand that but fun excitement you know those type of things definitely yes your art would come alive but not only does it come alive there if you are an artist in heaven you have a gallery of your own you have a studio that's part of your mansion people come to get the art you create and you give it away now when they take that art home and hang it on the wall guess what it comes alive oh my god so so she actually thought of something that really does happen in heaven not just in the galleria area where all the artists come but in anybody's home they'll come by no matter what you create or make that's your gift you give it away there's no money everything is given freely but how delightful for somebody maybe sees a magnificent horse picture and they take it home and hang out and all of a sudden that horse is galloping in the picture so yes that is exactly true it does come alive and not only can you jump into your art there's a place called cartoon village in heaven that he also made for children and when you go there you can create cartoon of movies with your friends and then you become a cartoon and you jump in the movie the cartoon and all your friends can come and see and watch it and when it's over you step back up and then you're you again so i'm telling you people that think kevin is boring they don't know very much about it so you were absolutely right yes you can jump into your artwork and then you're there in the art wow oh that's exciting annabelle i know you're going to be excited about that so think about what you're going to draw when you get there annabelle because you're going to be able to to be part of it okay the next question is from evangeline and she's four years old and she says can i have a rainbow house with rainbow things in heaven hi evangeline of course you can it is heaven um mansions are made out of almost anything that you can think of but totally that rainbow comes from the father it's living it moves in and out it's on a lot of places in heaven you yourself can become rainbow color if you want to the clothing you wear changes color so why wouldn't you be able to have a rainbow house i would say yes that would definitely be a yes oh that's that's exciting my daughter's gonna love that too evangeline because she always talks about i want to ride on the rainbow i want to slide on the rainbow and i think i've said in heaven i bet you can that's always how i answer in heaven you can and then michael is age eight this is my son and i asked him to ask you a question and he said can i have a house made out of candy oh no everybody every child wants their house made out candy and the best part is you can eat it and it comes right back uh because it's heaven there's a whole place called jello land in heaven it really does exist and then part of that land of course there's there's houses made out of candy they're made out of all kinds of things uh flowers a whole house made out of flowers and they sing to you all the time when you come to your mansion and uh but candy is one of the most favorite things i know there's chocolate waterfalls probably would be a part of that mansion made out of candy uh you can just go jump out in the waterfall and drink the chocolate or swim in the chocolate and so yes and in the jello lamb part of it people will reach out and they'll take you know a bite of the house or take a handful the house need it then it comes right back you can bounce in the jello land houses also and uh but the candy house i think is a great idea it makes me think of that game candy land so let me tell you i will say this jesus christ does have a soft part in his heart for sweets he loves sweets and so he'd probably be right there with you you know tasting the chocolate or the candy canes or whatever else was made your house was made out of so the answer is absolutely yes you could have a house made out of candy oh well he's gonna be really excited about that because that is his question he's asked me many times cat he said do you think i can have a candy house and i said well with the lord all things are possible so i'm sure yes you can yes that's absolutely true now we're gonna we're gonna move uh now to questions from adults so they're a little different than the kids questions i have i have noticed that um so the first question is from illumination and she actually um is behind the scenes here and she wants to know my grandma went to heaven in 2019 and she absolutely loves christmas even her memorial service was christmas themed is it possible that jesus would give her a home in christmas town because she loved it so much on earth i'm sure he had started building it your your mansion gets started being built when you're born uh when you're born he starts working on okay now in heaven there's no time so it's not like wow was that 10 years 20 30 40 50 years and usually he times you're coming home to heaven with your mansion being done so i promise you he already knew what she loved you know he sees and hears us on the earth i assure you that he had already built that house in christmas town knowing her love for that so if you want to visit her when you get to heaven you will be going to christmas town probably going on sleigh rides she might come to your mention and pick you up in the sleigh and then you can go see her mansion a lot of that type of things happens in heaven so i'm sure yes that she lives in christmas town oh that's awesome well there you go elimination she we talked a little bit behind the scenes and she said i feel like the answer is yes but i i just want to hear from cat what what she has to say about it so paulette is our next question and paulette um asks does heaven celebrate jesus's earthly birthday yes can i hold up something you can zoom in on it and i'm just gonna show them this is a new product not we've already been selling about a hundred so it's not about buying it but i want to show you uh how much they celebrate the birth of christ this is a scene i actually saw in heaven now this is part of the scene i might show you the artwork for the rest of it in a minute but this is a scene in heaven of a little girl uh who lives in heaven and she's riding on a sled with the snowman she built on the front of the sled actually says happy birthday jesus because i had already said that everybody celebrates the birth of christ in heaven and so here they are on their slide you might have to tell me if i can can you see it yes can you see the little the girl the snowman her pet is also there and there it says at the bottom happy birthday jesus so yes they do celebrate the birth of christ in christmastown and uh and everybody loves to come there's one of the reasons they actually do come there they all sing happy birthday to him they have non-stop cake people was gonna get cake in christmas town and hot chocolate you know and and other things like that you're definitely going to experience that but but it is the number one place people would think it would be some other place maybe religious place but nope this is where he chooses and i know people it may not have been exactly december 25th but he loves for people to celebrate his birthday and also created christmas towns so people would be able to go there to do that [Music] and in christmas town today is there um a big christmas dinner uh constance wants to know this and it kind of links with the last question is there a big christmas dinner in heaven for christmas and why do you um we do it on the earth many of the things we actually do and the holidays we celebrate they already celebrate those in heaven and absolutely you're going to eat and people can eat all they want to there's no weight gain no no allergies no food allergies and so absolutely how would that be to celebrate during that time what what represents the time of the year why would there not be a feast yes there is definitely a big feast the good part is this no animals life is taken god makes all the food out of light but it tastes like turkey it tastes like it tastes like ham it tastes like pie whatever you love to eat but they certainly have a a non an ongoing feast in christmas town wow that's awesome i can't wait to eat in heaven i know i've heard you talk about it before about how big also isn't the food really big in size there oh yes like the pizza place that was taken to a place called pizza joe's in heaven and the pizzas were the size of the table it was sitting on now this was a round table this round table will seat about eight people now when i say the word table don't think i'm talking about just a normal table that's not like that it's filled with light and you have like your your plate or you can eat on slides out in front of you and then you just point you you eat a slice of pizza it's about this big i can't even get it i can't even get it the pizza slice is so big you have to hold it with both hands to eat it it was the best tasting pizza i had ever had in my life and right next to that is an italian restaurant where the meatballs are like [Laughter] and the guy who the guy who has that he had an italian restaurant on the earth it was his gift he loved to cook for people he has a chef's hat on he has one of those handlebar mustaches and he's really really happy person so yeah i've been to like an italian restaurant the ice cream parlor oh my goodness the the scoops are this big of the ice cream and you can even create your own kind of ice cream in this ice cream shop and then they change and they add a name to the um the menu up there what you can order and you can you can name the ice cream yourself wow that's so awesome and i know i i love to bake so i'm a big baker and i thought when you talked about christmas town how the artists where um they give away their paintings is it the same with bakeries like we can make really huge christmas cookies and then give them away to all our neighbors oh yes you can they'll probably be lined up outside you can give away your baked goods and i know people they say i don't know what my gift is and yet oh my word they like to make the best brownies on the earth and when are you kidding it's going to be making brownies you know they love to do it they love to give them away as gifts uh people who are blessed on the earth are the ones who who get to operate in their gift now and so uh they they're used to do that but in heaven nobody misses their true destiny god sent us all as a gift with a gift it wasn't not talking about a spiritual group talk about a natural gift that everybody can enjoy and uh and we know people who sing they're singing amazing that's their gift people in sports they play really well that's their gift but there's a lot of other gifts gifts there's like design you know or baking i can tell you that that food and baking and stuff like that is considered an art in heaven that's awesome i can't wait to bake and and i bet the the machinery there is like incredible too like huge mixers times 10. yes it's incred the thing is is now if you want to have a bakery that will be part of your mansion you don't have a place where you live in a place where you work and it's not work when you love it right so you would go to your mansion to visit your bakery and all your good you'd have a showroom with all the food there you had made and yes they do have kitchens in heaven if you want one now if you're gonna be a baker you're gonna have to have a kitchen you probably have people a sign that that's their gift is to help in that um unless it's one of the little tiny angels that looks sort of like an elf and i'm just gonna get bash for that but i don't care uh there are ones that you have little helpers assigned in heaven if you have a bakery because you know you know if you got a half a million people coming to get your goods you need help yes and so it's a whole different life because i've seen the kitchen of someone who loved to feed people her dining room seated 100 people and it was a dining room in her mansion and in her kitchen had such high tech i didn't even know what some of the stuff was this is one of the best parts about heaven if you choose to cook i saw this woman making a massive salad that was going to be served to all of her guests and she was peeling like a cucumber and as she peeled it in the in the and it came off of the cucumber it disappeared there's no waste there's no trash there's no cleanup how about that isn't that awesome hallelujah there's no cleanup no garbage to take out people there's there's no waste dumps and having to leave stuff it just disappears and um that's like back to the waterfall chocolate waterfalls you can get in and swim around you have chocolate all over you but when you step out of it it's gone so but the food thing in heaven just amazed me that everything you eat is made out of life but your substance i know people think well light is something you can't really touch or feel and heaven it is it's the number one thing that things are made out of in heaven actually your spirit man is made out of light but you don't float around like a little cloud in heaven you walk on the streets you use your stuff in your mansion you ride the horses uh it's an actual life it's a literal life in heaven wow that's awesome well i'm excited to go and cook in heaven i'm telling you that i've had that deep within me where i'm like i can't wait to cook and bake and give away my stuff in heaven because that is your visit your place yes please do please everybody come visit me please okay um elaine elaine wants to know can you describe how jesus became a seed and was planted in the womb of young mary that's awesome there's actually a story the holy spirit told me one time it's called twas the year before christmas and i'm just going to share a little part of it i'll probably have it printed out later on there but it starts like twas the year before christmas when all through father's house every creature was stirring yes even the mouse there was so much activity like uh maybe um earth time a year before that when it was being announced that the word who was christ in heaven the word was going to be sent to earth as a baby to be raised up to walk among the people here and then one day would give himself for them so i don't know if people even think about this they think well they're just supernatural they just fly around do whatever they want to do oh no there's much planning in heaven and explaining in heaven because you have to understand the angels were there long before we were put on the earth and so there was all kinds of activity in heaven all the time they'd be sent on assignments places throughout the cosmos and things so much activity going on in heaven because people were on the earth you know people were living on the earth at the time christ was born and so the father had to take the word and explain to him this is the plan this is the plan i have for you you will have flesh on you number one the word was all spirit but like i explained in heaven that's like a whole different realm the spiritual realm to a spiritual person would be literal like i'm touching this like i'm holding this cup right here see in heaven if you had something to drink uh you would also touch the cup and drink out of it even though it's a spiritual world uh it still had life and activity and there was building going on plans being made talking about people who had just come home to heaven people getting to greet them so but heaven does like to have a lot of celebrations so this was a different time when the father called the word to see him and explained to him talked to him he said would you be willing to do this he asked him we know it was it was at that time it was a father the word and holy spirit and when the father would want to create something when there was nothing he would go somewhere where there was nothing he would speak what he wanted the word would step out of him and you have to understand in the spiritual world the father the father son holy spirit can step inside of each other that's what makes them one the three in one so they would go places together and i'm thinking the word probably thought oh we're going to go create something but the father took him aside and explained to him it's time now for hope to come to the earth and therefore my plan is to send you as a baby to be a baby on you to be raised by a wonderful mom and then one day you would grow up and then you would give yourself for the sins of the world and i'm quite sure because i know we think well they know everything the father really does know everything because everything comes from him and this was his plan for man to help man to help man on the earth they needed help okay uh the enemy who satan was wreaking havoc everywhere he was just getting people to fall into darkness and the answer was to send the light of the world which was jesus christ so he did explain to him he said i will take you and i will make you into a seed and holy spirit will take you down to the earth hover over mary and plant you in the womb of mary and i know people don't think about this too much when they just read the word but you should really study the word it says in there that he was planted in this as a seed in mary and later because we know man carries a seed i won't get into all that normally the man carries a seed and then you get married then you have children but this was totally different uh this was a supernatural divine thing that happened that the father took the word who was his son made him into a seed the holy spirit hovered over the womb of mary and even talks about it in the bible and then she he was he was planted as a seed grew up in mary was burst into the earth as a real being he had flesh on him okay why did he have to have flesh so that people could see him because on the earth normally you don't see spiritual beings unless god opens your eyes to that spirit realm which is also all around us so he had to explain not only to him what he was going to do he had to take all the tribes of angels and explain to them this is what is going to happen it's going to be different now it'll be different because redemption is coming to mankind the word has said yes he's willing to do this and then he will be known on the earth as my son who one day will give himself they were totally they were undone because this was something that had never happened before i know when new things happen on the earth people think oh that couldn't happen or that won't happen but you know heaven has been through many things like we have there was even there was kind of war one time in heaven that was when satan tried to take over and he was kicked out in a lightning bolt uh so they've experienced that all of that happening so this was new news even for them a new revelation so now the word was being sent to the earth would be not not recognized on the earth because when he was the word he was a spiritual body and he's going to have flesh on him so he'll look different and they could watch from having to see everything going on so yes on that beautiful morning nine months after the holy spirit hovered over mary and planted that seed uh jesus christ and then he was born into this earth such a celebration in heaven took place um that the host came in saying to the shepherds gabriel came to announce his birth i'm sure there was quite a sight uh you know here on the earth to see this all this activity going on it was very major for the father to give his son as a gift to this world and that's why god loves it when we give gifts just so you realize christmas time on the earth is so precious to god it represents us loving one another giving gifts to each other helping each other you know making a difference bringing hope when christ came as that child he began to bring hope to people everything was going to change about when you pass from this earth you could go back home to heaven having received christ as your savior so this is one of the best gifts ever given to the earth would be jesus christ the son of the living god and he was raised just like you and i had to be a little baby learn to walk and learn to read and write and i do know this about jesus he loved reading when he was being schooled on the earth he didn't care too much about writing and i love the holy spirit he said that's why there's only 10 commandments instead of 20 because he didn't care too much about writing that's a joke in case you didn't get it so anyway the star coming several years before the birth of christ that the wise men came across the deserts and some people see them in a little play here's the three kings they were from different countries they saw the star of christ in the east so they traveled east from the desert regions from three different countries it took them two years to cross those deserts to come and bring the gifts to to to jesus and i don't know that he was living in the manger at that time they did come to honor him recognize who he was so even people on in other countries knew something special had happened and so from that point on jesus lived his life walked out his life on this earth so that he could become our sacrifice and what he was doing was making a way back to the father so i will say this the day you pass and you step out of this body and you're going home to heaven jesus will come get you he's the one who walks you up the steps of the throne and says look father your if your son or daughter your son or your daughter whichever one is has come home to you that's part of the blessing that christ gets for having given himself for so but it was all a stir in heaven all these people these these creatures and these angels and the host of heaven the army they were all talking back and forth non-stop did you hear the words going to go to earth did you hear he's going to be a baby uh that sounds to them that was like sort of wild but they knew when the father said something it was going to happen so all of heaven prepared for this to happen things were repaired on the earth people were put in place there would be a part of this whole story of his birth how they had to travel they were told they had to travel to uh you know be accountable for who they were and register and that happened to be in bethlehem how about that and god had already placed his star in the heavens to be seen uh two years before this happened so that's the true story of why we celebrate this time of the year is because we celebrate the birth of jesus christ who came for us because he loved us the father loved us the holy spirit loved us and this is their plan for you for i for every person in the earth god desires that none should perish but you have to choose jesus christ to live in this beautiful place this world called heaven that is the father's house that's beautiful when you talk about jesus walking us up the stairs back to the father i mean that touches my heart so deeply because it's i can just imagine that and the beauty of seeing the father and just the love that must come and washed over you as you're with jesus and seeing the thought oh i just can't wait for that day oh you're already undone that that jesus christ is with you you hear about him people have encounters sometimes i already got the spirit of god all over me right now you hear stories of people encountering him on the earth and i can say i have seen him many times but it is never normal i'm so undone every time consumed by the love that just comes from him it it just permeates every part of your body and you forget about every care you have you're not you're not listening so much to all the stuff going on right now in this world god has a plan for this world okay it says the earth is the lord's and the fullness thereof this earth belongs to jesus christ he paid a price for it and he knows what's going on let me tell you there's stuff that's going to be exposed i can just say get ready for some great great days ahead no matter what the enemy thinks they're going to do god has a plan to be in some of the greatest days if you're young you have the most powerful amazing future ever on the earth to do great things for him the creativity will be so powerful and amazing people will be shocked some of the stuff will be created on the earth to help us our life to be better and and happier but the number one thing that will happen is the presence of the lord is about to consume this whole earth and the knowledge of that glory will be seen and known all over the earth hallelujah i feel i feel that so strong when you talk about that it's it's going to be an awesome time it's awesome time to be alive uh there was some there's someone who asked a question about i wanted to find it real quick because they asked about the oh the shepherds here we go sally asked about um what happened to the shepherds to whom the angels appeared 30 years later did they connect with jesus um the baby they had seen or did they always wonder what happened to that baby have you seen any of those shepherds in heaven um i'm sure the shepherds made it happen i will tell you this they never forgot what they saw i mean here is one of the one one of the archangels appearing and gabriel is beautiful he's so glorious i'm sure the sky lit up you know the sky open person lit up and here he's given this glorious announcement you know that this messiah is being born the son of god has come to be amongst mankind and i can tell you that i will say this too that where it talks about the great host appeared the ones that sang were actually part of the army of heaven okay and you know it says in the bible that the shepherds were afraid they were so afraid that their body hurt now they weren't going to be hurt but they'd never seen anything like this so you can imagine warring angels coming with gabriel to sing and to glorify christ's birth on the earth that's actually what actually happened and so they were singing i'm sure it was really loud but it was beautiful and so you think you saw just one angel you'd never forget it but here you've seen multitudes of the these armies of heaven and gabriel and the seraphim probably were there singing their heads are like blue fire blue fire their hair is so can you imagine this site and i know no one has been there and has not seen it doesn't understand i was taken back and i actually saw that scene i saw what happened because he was using the army of heaven and i'm like no wonder no wonder no for me because i see i'm a seer i see the army of heaven around me all the time i see their activities i see them you know battling the army of darkness and how badly they get beat the army of darkness gets beat but so i'm i was accustomed to seeing them but seeing the sight the shepherds were cowering behind rocks or bushes their eyes were so wide you know here's gabriel making this beautiful announcement and then here comes the army to sing in the heavens and and it's the lights just like blinding from there so you can imagine they probably repeated that story over and over again to everybody they knew probably they probably didn't believe it but it didn't matter to them when you have an encounter you never forget it so i'm quite sure because jesus did teach over in that region he taught over there there was jerusalem and other places there i'm sure some of the shepherds probably eventually lived in um in jerusalem i mean it wasn't that many years now he was in there he was already known as a great carpenter joseph taught him as a master carpenter so jesus was known as the carpenter the son of joseph but we know he was the son of god uh so he was known because of that but but when jesus turned 30 he began his public ministry that means he started demonstrating the miracles the signs and wonders and i'm quite sure it made it back to the ears of those because this spread far and wide that said i'm sure that some of those who were in bethlehem or maybe relooking in jerusalem they probably knew exactly who that was when he started talking about being the son of god i i'm quite sure that there are some of those shepherds are in heaven yes wow that's awesome i i can imagine that you went got actually got to go back and see that whole entire scene that's incredible oh my god i can so if when i get to go to heaven can i go to a place to watch that scene too yes actually there is a place they have um they actually have theaters in heaven how about that now again i have to always explain you don't have to have ratings like r for rotten pg like partly good g for good uh you know i mean they actually they they know what goes on here so any of the theaters in heaven again there's no darkness there's not going to be profanity there's no no uh you know killings none of that no violence whatsoever so there's no dark witchcraft none of that is in the theaters in heaven but they have a place where you can go uh and you can actually watch when god made when they made the earth you actually get to see him creating earth by watching it but it's not like a screen it's like you're there wow oh my gosh i can't i cannot wait for that um there's another question about um renee asked this question and i've heard a few people ask this question before um i'm seeing a lot of christians fighting about celebrating or not christmas is that a spirit of religion trying to stop the celebration of christ's birth i think it's partly that i think it's partly what we've been taught our whole lives in church you know depending on the church you go to because you know there can be 50 churches to probably hundreds of thousands of churches right now and i tell you i tell people no matter what church you go to make sure they're teaching about the validity of jesus christ who he is he's the only way to heaven i think it was that but i think totally satan any chance satan god to draw people away from the truth that's the bottom line satan doesn't want people to have fun joy celebration but he does not want them to have the truth because the truth sets you free so okay this place in heaven was created before the earth was here so you can't say that christmas is some pagan holiday sorry people okay the pagans weren't here when god made it in heaven however there is someone who lived in heaven saw all the beauty the wonder and the fun and when he was thrown out of heaven he created wicked evil things and said that was his symbol that was his celebration their lies i'm not saying there weren't these wicked groups on the earth doing things but satan stole different things in heaven to make them look like they were bad so christmas town belongs to god he decided to create it no human hands made that place because it's a place of fun of splendor a place to celebrate his son it's in heaven he loves it when we celebrate it on the earth and you know what you all need to go get can you get me the dvd real quick jen i'm going to show you really quick a dvd i would encourage everyone to get and watch with your family it's called saving christmas it's right there by kirk cameron actually got really tired of listening to the very thing you're talking about he got tired of all the insults and and and dragging you know christmas down saying it's a pagan you shouldn't have nothing to do with it so he went to the word of god got all the scriptures and wrote this script for this movie called saving christmas it is hilarious but it actually shows you nicholas back in the time when he walked down the earth where that came from and he actually explains why christmas is so important on the earth like i said it's the only time some people forgive each other it's the one time they reach out and give to help others even people they don't know and we watch this many times and so i'm just going to show you the cover i already heard from kirk cameron's people saying thank you for showing it it explains everything and i think you can get it on amazon is that where you got it janet amazon so i'm going to share with you right now here it is it's called saving christmas by kirk cameron and he explains why the christmas tree is important are the all the balls the lights on the tree what they represent and you know representing christ even things like the nutcracker what that represents for for heaven for heaven on the earth and why do we eat why do we celebrate what does all this mean and he shoots down every myth or reality of what evil has tried to take over he explains it the best of anyone i've ever heard so i will encourage people get that dvd let let yourself watch it with you and your in your family it's the best explanation i've heard i can just say christmas even now people are having more hope than they've had in like almost two years uh hope is flooding joyous flooding through celebration i know most people pitch or sell heaven is nothing but a place where you bow down to god all the time part of the way we worship in heaven is enjoying things he put there that's our gratefulness for what he gave us even in heaven so heaven celebrates it doesn't have funerals there's no funerals there's no firing squads there's no death certificates being made out no one's crying no one's grieving in heaven it is a celebration of what christ did for us by coming to this earth walking as a man showing you the right way to live what righteousness is what unrighteousness is but i can tell you what there is a copycat enemy our true enemy enemy is satan i know he uses wicked people to do things and then he makes up all these occults and all these things i don't even understand don't care about because i'm not a part of that and i choose not to participate or read it or watch it i feel myself with the light of god with his word what his plans are but i can tell you christmas has always had the presence of god on it when you attend church celebrating the birth of christ the choir singing represents the angels that sang on the day of his birth of some of the most glorious songs ever made or created were ones about christmas because in those songs many of them talk about oh holy night hearts and heart the herald angels sing and so all these beautiful things came out of this one beautiful holiday it's more than a holiday it's actually a way of life that's what it is so yes i celebrate it i will celebrate it now i will celebrate in heaven one day it brings families together but the gift giving is one of the big things i know man has commercialized it and i'm not saying you know go go get a gift for somebody it's a wonderful beautiful thing to do maybe help the poor with something you know that's one of my favorite things to do also but christmas is dear to the father's heart he made it not a pagan not some satanic group even satan didn't make it he just tried to steal it and he lost amen and what this is a perfect this is a perfect question to go along with what you just said um there's the user it says username because i'm happy they asked a question um what can we give jesus for his birthday to show him we love and honor him i'm gonna move my scarf over there yo i would say he loves cards and uh what i do if i want to make a card out for jesus i actually make one out to him and i put it on my tree i mean you don't need to put it even in a card you can make him one i would say he loves the kids to draw pictures you know maybe christmas trees or gifts or something like that just telling him that you love him thank him for coming to earth to be the way to make a way back to the father he loves it when we sing christmas carols especially ones that talk about the holy night and away in the manger he loves and actually watches many of the events put on by churches or groups that show that scene back in the way back in the day when christ was born and they have someone be mary and joseph and baby jesus and then they show you know if they're really big ones they bring live animals in but he lost to see the celebration in our heart so i would say the best gift you could give him would be celebrate the holiday help people love them and remember why we celebrate it it is about funny gifts and you know the joy but number one it's about a child being born in the manger a king the king of this world who created everything we see and everything we touch and he's very much a lie right now excited about this time of the year so i'd say make a little note telling him that drawing a little picture hang it on your tree if i was a parent i would save those somewhere in a special box one day and say this is what you did to celebrate our king jesus oh that's beautiful uh there brandon wants to know is there spiritual significance when people here on earth light up their homes with christmas lights do people in heaven light up their mansion in a similar fashion for the sake of christmas they have lights everywhere i can tell you if you think that you've been driven somewhere where they have a lot of decorations and things everywhere in christmas town even outside of christmas town they all have some kind of lights because it's celebrating when the angels came and the sky lit up with the glory of heaven that's actually what those lights represent that's what they like they represent on your tree on your home you're making a statement i celebrate the birth of jesus christ i celebrate with him in my life that i belong to him and i'm recognizing that i'm standing with the promises he gave me so i would say definitely put lights up we put lights everywhere we can uh the other thing one more thing in the and jesus just said to me now that sounds wild he said don't forget the cake it is celebrating my birthday why not make a cake and eat it so i can come and see you eating the cake we actually make a birthday cake for jesus on christmas and at our christmas dinner we have a birthday cake for jesus and we sing happy birthday to him even though he doesn't need to have that done he loves it so don't forget to have cake or cupcakes or something that your children can be a part of and celebrate with him at a time when he had to change his whole life and even who he was just to come to this earth for us so we can sing happy birthday to jesus on christmas and make that part of our family tradition with our kids so that they're always raised knowing that it is that's why we celebrate that's a great idea to do that as a family for all you moms with young kids that's a great idea we did that growing up and now we still do it even now we still do it so definitely you're recognizing him you're you're honoring him by recognizing him that he is so special he's worth making a cake for besides like i said he loves sweets i didn't get to finish that when jesus was growing up as a child he loved honeycomb it was his favorite thing it talked about it in the bible him and honey but john the baptist his cousin also ate honey and it was the sweet of that time that would be like eating cake you know in this day and he still loves sweets and every time some new baker comes home to heaven he's going to visit their shop uh he loves his squeezing he'll probably visit you if you make sweet sweet i was just making a half cake have cake and celebrate the birth of christ oh that's awesome well we have one i think we can get through one more question um christine asked my dad went to be with god recently and he loved to feed god's cardinals my dad loved how the snow and the cardinals looked would my dad be feeding the birds in christmas town or are they all over heaven birds are all over heaven but i have seen i don't know why they just look so beautiful people make ornaments with the red cardinals and i think i know they're around normally other times of the year but i just think they're represented if you look at i got probably probably 20 christmas cards at least that had red cardinals on them i'm not kidding like with the tree with the snow and everything in it i'm sure there are birds there because the birds come to sing happy birthday to jesus too and so the birds will come in they'll go out they'll come in but i have seen red cardinals in heaven uh in christmas town and other types of birds too but i'm sure that they will be able to see birds in that place singing to jesus oh that's beautiful well thank cat for all the questions today i mean they were they were some awesome questions when i was reading through them i was like oh my gosh these are all you guys did an awesome job sending in christmas time questions i enjoyed each and every one of them so will you just pray for us real quick before we end uh this time together and just bless everybody that's listening sure um i was gonna show one more picture and this represents sort of like the army of heaven coming with gabriel making the announcement um this is the star right here if you can see if i can hold it right i'll put the star you see the star or not yes is it right side up yeah there's the star of bethlehem there's gabriel making the announcement but the army that's with him is not normal and you can see some of them look like creatures and they're singing so the shepherds would be down on the ground you know trying to go like oh my gosh what is that and what is that up there in the sky uh whenever it says host uh in the bible they're talking about the army of heaven and so uh yes many of them came to sing because you have to remember jesus name was the lord of hosts so this was his army coming to sing about his birth on the earth along with gabriel and so i had to show that real quick picture but i will pray father i thank you right now for blessing everybody in this wonderful time this wonderful season on the earth god don't let legalism and religious mindsets set into people that they don't think you should celebrate it's not about fun it totally has always been about fun the sacrifice of your son was one part of his life but his birth was totally different great celebrations were taking place in heaven even mary and joseph and those who were present with him they were celebrating and knowing he was the son of god coming to this to this earth so father i thank you that the reality and the presence of jesus christ will flood everyone's home everyone's person at this time of the year god let love consume any fears any concerns about any cares you know jesus came to take them away i thank you for recognizing his birth recognizing who he is but also remember the celebration part that they celebrate in heaven on earth as it is in heaven thank you god for blessing each and every person if they lost something let it be given back to them seven times over as your as your as one of your followers i thank you that we're entering into a holy season of the glory being released in the earth thank you for giving us a measure but right now let sometimes their house light up without any lights on it let the light of god come over their face father it says that we will shine like the stars in the heavens i thank you that we're here for a reason we were sent that our birth was timed on the earth to be here right now to bring hope and life and joy may the season be filled with people relationships being restored uh homes being given father stuff being redeemed for people this is the time of year you love you chose for your son to come to this earth and god the date and the day is not important the recognition of it is so father let people let go of things they need to let go and enjoy this time celebrate this time that's what you would want them to do so i just impart that to them right now the life of god the love of god the plans of god to walk in this earth to bring hope and help and healing in the name of jesus for jesus with jesus because of jesus it's all about him amen amen amen how can people get a hold of you cat if they want to follow you um i know we have your

hey happy wednesday december 29 2021 about two more days uh after today for this year which we'll be happy to say goodbye to at least as far as some of the things that went on but we're glad to put those in the rear view mirror you know not that god was taken by surprise by any of this he saw it all ahead of time he knew what was going to happen he wasn't shocked or starved in fact i'm going to ask cat a question about that when we bring her on in just a minute but a couple of quick announcements for the next 90 days give or take uh when we do johnny eno and he'll be on tomorrow live we

so for today and tomorrow we're going to go ahead and keep this donation link on the top you'd have to type that out or and then there's the mailing address too we're not going to do that all the time but but during these last couple of days with people reminded that oh you have to get my year in tax giving and tax receipts i want to get it postmarked by by december 31st or i want to get it donated online so we appreciate that very very much it helps us a lot there's quite a few people i think as we get into the new year we'll bring people our staff on again and introduce you to everyone so you'll see who we all are so all right i think that's it let's bring in kat kerr hi there kat how are you doing i'm doing great good so you just said you're taking a little bit of vacation so you're back from your vacation started to do the show and then back at it well my vacation is i get a hotel in the city because i have to come back and forth here all the time so it's not like i'm a way away that's but still you know i'm away at the nighttime wow nice nice family visiting and of course right now we're not out of our our offices yet so there's really no place for anyone to visit me here so just go get a really big nice hotel room and get them some and we all can get together and do things that's what we do good good i have a question that i will open with when we go to questions but before i do that um anything you want to talk about current events or anything going into next year anything that either the lord's showing you or what to expect i'm going to throw that to you because we haven't pre-talked about this i don't know if you have anything so oh i do absolutely the father's been talking to me the last few days now you have to understand when he talks to me he talks to me like it's already done when i say already done i mean his plan at the completion of his plan for america his completion of his plan in these days for the world so he talks to me it's always positive it's always powerful and that's why i'm able to release that to the people but i want you to know even though it looks pretty bad in certain places there are things still happening i mean i i think probably the number one thing i notice and hear about a lot is how many people in the country this country america are standing up against the left i'm not going to say much more than that in unexpected ways and they they didn't ever think this would all happen i know you think it's all dragged up they thought everything was going to be over a couple months like they'd have us and our whole lives would be over that's what they had planned but the devil always forgets that we have god in us and this is god's country and he doesn't know the mind of god himself satan does not he doesn't even know your mind unless you speak it that's why you need to be careful what you're saying with your mouth that's good a lot in the atmosphere around you you actually create an atmosphere around you who's going to be in that atmosphere and so make sure it's not all about doom and gloom and fear and stuff like that i'm not saying that kind of thing thing isn't real but you do not have to choose that so i can tell you god does not choose it he's talking about the days of glory more than he ever has before to me because he said everything is beginning to be like dust and i know you probably don't understand that as a spiritual a phrase that means everything you're living in now or having to be confronted with now will become like dust and in spiritual that means that will be hard to see hard to remember what that was like so when things do happen on god's timeline because everybody's talking about different timelines or calendars or whatever i go by god's timeline and if you could be taken to heaven i'd probably ask him to show you his own timeline that wouldn't take you forever because then you would know number one you're not at certain times that people are saying right this is not the perilous times it is not the tribulation and stop saying that the antichrist is on the earth he's not on the earth people the antichrist spirit is which is a whole different thing but he's not here yet okay he's not going to sit around and wait for several hundred years to do anything satan however is trying to do a big takeover right now which will fail miserably embarrassingly i'm telling you what they won't want to talk about hell and these times are going through because of what is about to happen they won't talk about that part he probably won't allow them to mention what a huge fail it was and trying to take over this country and i don't even have to mention names or right or left or anything to tell you that i'm telling you from god's plans the days that are coming of greater glory major changes will begin to happen probably in the first quarter i can tell you that much and the first quarter of 2022 uh which is some of god's great plans to be revealed in that time and things major things to begin to happen and whether it's about certain presidents or not certain presidents fake or real or whatever god himself is going to start doing things in the first quarter of this 2022 i'm extremely excited about it so i want to encourage you you don't have to live in your soul but every wicked terrible thing you're hearing or watching hopefully you're not i do want to add one thing or this is glorious news i happen to know actually literally that these big networks are way down in their viewing by 25 or 30 percent wow yeah that is good they're even this is on the secular channel this was talking about this which i i just heard about you know literally heard about from another news person that they're down like i i can't mention what networks but you know all those who've been going along filling people with lies they're down by the viewing many of them 30 percent 25 which is unheard of for major networks because they won't stop saying the same thing people are tired of hearing the same news hey you network you're supposed to be able to deliver the news unbiased to give us great information about many different things get out of your box get out of your rut you're stuck in a hole you may be covered up with dirt one day that's good this is the for real this is a for real does not is some kind of a spiritual kind of a thing out there in the natural world this is really happening for the first time on network reviewing they they're so they're they're filled with fear and they're really very upset that people aren't watching them anymore but they're fed up with what they're getting that should be a clue yeah for sure for sure okay let me ask you this because you said something and i want to see if i heard you right you said when things began to happen which i think you were referring to when god starts doing what he's about to do you said it would be hard to remember were you saying it's going to be hard to remember these bad times is that what you were saying yes that's a huge thing that's a huge prophetic word right there it is it will be very hard to remember and even in the past when people went through things and i've said this before but i don't mind repeating myself because god doesn't mind repeating himself to me he says things almost certain parts of the day now he's continually saying things to me not just to keep me encouraged but every time he speaks his frequency goes in me and you want people want to know why are you so fear sometimes why do you why do you just get loud and yell because he's yelling because he is so he knows that he knows that he knows if anyone else does he does this is what's going to happen not what they're saying is going to happen the new norm will be living in the glory manifesting for god who he is in this earth to the point where people want believers to be their friends wow wow is that going to begin to go on you will not even in your soul have room for the past stuff that you went through are these days which everyone's going to realize at one point it was all a fake even some of those who were part of it god removes things sometimes off the earth in the atmosphere even in the spirit realm some things are just wiped out and i can prove it in the word of god because at the very end of the bible it says the former things will be remembered no more there you go well he's the only one who can do that and i'm telling you what he's going to do that somewhat as this whole thing crumbles and falls and you need to go back and look at the november 4th report people of um was that 20 20 20 21 no 2020 if it's november 4th it's 2020. yeah yeah yeah yeah go back and see that and you hear exactly what's gonna happen guess what he has not changed his plans just like when he told noah build the ark it was 120 years later people now aren't you glad you're not noah we're not waiting 120 years for things to not just go back the way they were they there's no way they can and we don't want them to want to be greater and more powerful and more known in god's presence more on the earth and creativity and inventions and joy and celebration we've been more on the earth than they ever before so you can't even say i want to go back we're going forward we're going forward into the news that he has for us uh new for america new for places in this world but i can tell you right now he's not concerned he's not there you know rubbing his hands or anything yeah he knows what our beginning is he knows what our end is and it's not the end of ends okay that's good that's good cat let me ask this question you brought this up before a couple times we've mentioned this on the air but it's a long time in between where someone was writing to me the other day and she said it was so hard because all of these things kept happening bad and i can identify with that because after a year and a half of doing this give or take um a little more than less give or take but you see even when i try to never watch the news some gets in it'll slip in or i'll see something on that net while i'm working or something like that but the to the to the untrained eye it looks like worse and worse and worse things are happening but you said once this wickedness has been here all along god is just uncovering that am i saying that right you're absolutely right and almost any time god's going to do something really great on the earth the first thing he does is expose what evil is there you can go back to the bible with the old testament new testament that's happened over and over again but people who don't study the word like study i know people read it but if you study the word of god you would see and you look for certain things in the word then you would find out that whenever something god is going to happen the devil shows up to make people believe it's a lie there's no way this can happen i'm taking over you know you won't have a chance you won't have a life he's done that and not just in this country the devil always does that and that's what he's doing now only now you know his little ploy was take the whole world right now i'm going to push this whole thing through i'm going to bring the heat like satan could do it i'm going to bring the perilous times and the tribulation me and that's my big time i have news for him the tribulation won't be his big show it's going to be the greatest downfall he'll ever have ever for a thousand years after that he'll be thrown in the bottomless pit i would say that night would be a big show for him so even that's not if god's already got that and he knows what's going to happen at the end of those few short years he does have which is several hundred years away i'm just going to keep saying it um nobody knows the day but god god hasn't told me today but he has told me his generations and generations away that's good you're sitting there in fear that your children will have already having a rough time but your grandchildren your great grandchildren what is it going to be about so bad then they won't be able to live no this is the opposite it'd be so great the darkness won't be able to survive very well or work very well because of the power of god being operated in the earth so yes um what was the question well you did good on that uh let me ask you this there was a time i don't remember i have a suspicion that it could be this time period but when god first told you to declare let the show begin and then it's like the glacier on earth i don't know if he used that term but when did when did he declare that to you and what was going on in the earth at that time that was when um the show began was right about the time when well i'll have to say the t word when those elections started the first time okay the first time it was probably when i can go back and look because i actually have someone that recorded and it might be fun actually to release those cds just so people can happen to hear what god was saying because it really didn't start stuff back then yeah i didn't know any of this was known god already knew this stuff would happen but he knows how it's going to end and what will happen why is god allowing this so he can wipe out the platform of evil that is right now trying to control us you can see people go well if this wasn't here we'd all be doing fine oh no don't use the word fine say powerful because if evil wasn't present to control your every word every movement and dictate to you as a dictator what you were going to do what you could have what you couldn't have you don't you you forgot sometimes i think what freedom really is but what's coming is the greatest freedom we've ever had in this country wow that's like everywhere and he did say that i remember even the places i was in uh if you go back and look at um i think it's called what's it called jen not activation ministries anymore if you go back and look at yourself gateway i'm not zion and this was back in 2014 i think probably 2014 2015 um was when he began to say let the show begin and also i was in uh also in missouri saying that some people didn't want me to say that they weren't sure you know who would win in 2016. and yet he did win in a landslide yeah before that when god said let the show begin that show began actually in 2016 when those elections happened that was the show beginning wow all that you're in guess what all of this going on right now i got to just move the spirit the holy spirit's going like this drama king people yeah drama he's ahead of this whole drama it is a drama and you're all a part of it so you know what you sit in the sidelines and you cheer him on you cheer on god the show has begun the show of what it's like a big movie playing in heaven because to them it's happened of of god coming into this country laying his hands on it turning it red for righteousness and also for what is right yeah he's only touched it too late they can't come in their little black evil cells and and think i'm taking this and here's the power of god in the life of god laid in our country that's what they're trying to walk on and run on and let me tell you what there's going to be some slipping and falling like you never saw before because when it begins to rise up out of the ground this is how the spirit realm works when that begins to rise up it got laid on our country and he laid it down and like the beginning of 2016 and he was telling me to say even louder let the show begin that was his show this is not satan's show wicked man show this is god's show wow it's got comedy it's got excitement it's got drama you see all the drama it's got exposure in it for the evil uh it is a big show and it's not like it's a joke it's really real i know that but if you saw god's viewpoint the show has begun and it isn't over and guess what at the end is victory and celebration so god talks a lot about that's why i talk about victory and celebration you know celebrate and eat kate eat little pieces and i already tell people we're gonna have a glory diet when this is all over that's good so when you've been to heaven multiple times hundreds and hundreds of times have you ever seen the lord rubbing his hand saying man i don't know if this is gonna work out never once never and i have i mean i have seen when i say them that's the trinity okay when i've seen them they laugh a lot yeah i'm not laughing at the devil good laughing at the devil who thinks i have everything he's always saying i got it now that's what the devil says i got it now i got it i sort of like i don't know whatever but he hadn't got nothing but fair because he is the biggest loser that ever existed i think he must have been branded with a big l on his forehead that'd be interesting to see that because he thought listen if this person is dumb i mean i don't use a word lightly if he's stupid enough no intelligence almost left in his entire head who lives in heaven with the trinity and thinks he's taking over do you think he's numb enough and stupid enough try to take over the earth i would say yes he probably is he has not any marbles left in his head whatsoever um i think the demons play marbles with him or something i'm not being funny i'm being serious wow because something happened when he was kicked out of heaven part of his brain did get seared by the lightning bolt you can't be hit by a lightning bolt from god lightning in heaven is blessings and love he was kicked out of heaven with a million megawatts of love on that lightning bolt and ever since then was planning and planning to take this earth and now this is what robin and i heard robin say a little bit the other day that that satan was making his move to try to push it when he said push it push it ahead of time right like perhaps time people it lives in god it comes from god here's the one you thought he was going to take over kicked him out right he has no seat there no power there whatsoever and the only power he really has over us is what we give him or allow him to take or we participate with him those are our family members let's go this is still the show this is still the show's going on and now i'm telling you what the angels are sitting watching except not the army the army is extremely busy yeah to our fam our family members who have gone before uh we you said many times about they they are allowed to look down to portals to see special events weddings and births and parties and things like that whatever god allows them to see do they know about this stuff that's going on on the earth at all or are they kept from knowing this what what i'll tell you what they've seen they've already seen the show steve oh really how so we've already seen the show many times he will actually show them if there's a movement going on in the earth there's a time that's his time on there she shows them the end already in heaven so they're not up there going oh no what's going to happen to them they're up there celebrating and saying you know like go holy spirit go god go jesus they've already seen the end of that show that we're in right now okay that's really good all right here's a question i'm going to skip forward to number five so if you're watching this illumination she and i share the same list this kind of taps into what we're talking about and then a woman named debbie asked what's the difference between the kingdom age which i think the lord announced to you on uh 2012 and what's the difference between that and the millennial age do you can you describe it because they sound similar like the kingdom age and the millennial age people would think those were the same things so what's the difference no they're not the kingdom age is where we actually we as the body of christ operate in that kingdom that christ always talked about it is a spiritual kingdom you operate in spiritual power and authority it's all connected to heaven but it's our operations on the earth so when jesus takes over the millennial age it's a whole new age and actually the kingdom age goes all the way up into the into the millennial age where some people say are not it's not going to happen well you need to go to heaven and see god's timeline all right because i do know what will happen no this is us walking in power and authority on the earth because of christ with him uh changing and shifting all kinds of things because he wants it done and needs it done until the day when of course that that battle happens at the end of the kingdom age at the end of the kingdom age which includes the perilous times the tribulation at the end of that time when satan is bound and thrown in the bottomless pit for a thousand years christ takes the throne in the city of jerusalem in this natural world and rules as king of this world that's the millennial age so this is uh walking power and authority the kingdom age is a whole new time on the earth because of the revelation we have an understanding of who we are we will begin to shift things for god and i'm saying i'm not going to give the fullness of that yet but we were walking upon authority not having any fear of the enemy crushing darkness pushing it back operating with the army of heaven it's our time to shine it's hard time to do that for him at the end of those days will be the millennial age where christ himself will be sitting on the throne he won't need us to do that people yeah and the 2012 am i right was that when god announced the kingdom age 2012 yes yes we stepped off a threshold of time and we stepped into the kingdom age in 2012. okay and i i told people on this show before my uh spiritual father way taylor who's gone home to me with the lord was telling me that in 2012 that we had entered the kingdom age and i thought where is he getting that you know well he obviously received it from the lord he's been caught up in heaven himself so he said that and there was a uh older man who's now gone to be with the lord arthur burt there's a arthur burke with the k arthur who's the older one he began to prophesy this in 2012 that the he talked about the the flaw of the spirit that would not even ab again or something and he probably was 2012. so there are multiple people you're not the only one in other words that got that this is when we entered the because i have you you're wrong people in africa someone in africa wrote a book saying it's the kingdom age and they didn't fully understand what that meant they weren't shown into the future the kingdom age they knew god was saying that and that was also in 2012 i didn't even know about them so i had gone to the middle of america and declared this for god that we have stepped because he was telling me to do that so i did that we're in the kingdom age right now people which means we will understand fully what christ meant when he talked about the kingdom the gospel of the kingdom he was talking about the gospel but there's a whole kingdom that comes with that that's your power that's your authority that's your dominion because of belonging to him you have you operate in that kingdom and you're over the darkness so all this exposure of darkness has everything to do with that there's different things he will have god will have happened in the kingdom age first one understanding you're in a new time and then he sets a new person in place who will begin to bring the greatness here and then even though there's a disruption god knows all this and then he he had you know that people were understanding there is great darkness in the earth because before most people were ignoring it we were sound asleep we thought you were sounded asleep let me tell you yeah we were sound asleep we didn't know that the child trafficking was actually going on that the human trafficking was going we didn't we we literally because and whenever we brought up people would say that sounds like a big conspiracy theory there's no such thing no it was not a conspiracy theory yeah wow i mean that's huge in this year that we're in 2021 i think more people in the body of christ have awakened than have ever awakened i don't know if they're fully awake i don't know if we're we're fully awake yet in fact i want to segue into this question regarding cocaine we're in the kingdom it's getting intense now the lord already knows what's going to happen it's already done in his so are there things i'm not asking you to tell me what you shouldn't tell me but are there things that the lord has told you about the kingdom age that you're not supposed to release yet and maybe what are those type of they're not saying tell me if you're not supposed to but what are the why would you why would he give you stuff to say no don't release this yet oh i do know this that the revelation that he has given that we will operate in will totally change everyone's life yet he said it will change the way the body of christ operates so it's much more major than just an individual life being changed during these days uh it's not just waking you up this is what he said you need to wake up stand up and stand out so that's what's coming that's what he wants they need to wake up but they need to stand up that means stand up and say stuff and then when you stand out that's you operating in the power of god so he's letting me tell you that much he always has like a process or a wave a protocol that he does things god is not without protocol and planning okay he does do that probably more than anyone so the whole plan for this is happening now is for people to wake up and go wow there really is evil there's wickedness and it does want to take over and and he's showing people this is what people would live like in some foreign countries they do live like this they have nothing it's often taken away they're controlled they own nothing that is the plot of satan being worked out by man by wicked man satan can't take a throne right now himself and do what he'd like to do he can't do that so he's still using humans to do his dirty work that's all i can call it he's using humans who participate and say oh yes i want this i'll make money i'll be hell have power and he'll make them even feel powerful i'm talking about satan but he has no real power as far as god is concerned and he shouldn't have any power over us at all so what's going to happen is when god begins to do certain things you begin to not just wake up you're going to stand up and start saying stuff like i'm talking about taking authority declaring things to happen in the atmosphere and places in the earth that's what you should be doing it's wonderful to know god is here and yes he is he he is in control he owns all of this but he wants you as his representative as his son or his daughter not something else in between uh taking authority that you have a right to take because of christ and so what's coming next is the stand-up thing many people are waking up they don't know what to do i'm talking about believers right now right right dude they don't know what to say you know should i say be quiet or say nothing your voice power in it you have such power in the spirit realm because you have to remember you see with your human eyes right the physical realm you don't see unless you're a seer the spiritual realm when you say something what happens in the spiritual realm is satan's plans begin to get crushed from the spiritual side when they begin to get crushed by things you're declaring and taking authority over that power is taken away from the humans who are operating in wickedness this is why it's so important to understand who you are that's what spirit forces which is why i'm not gonna say everything yet but i'm telling you you will fully understand that's the stand up part but the standout part is really those words so stay wake up stand up and stand out that's god's plan for us in this time wake up realize this stuff has really happened it's really going on but you shouldn't have fear if you're a believer you have authority over it where in the kingdom in the kingdom of age so this all going to flow together and you know what it'll be almost like breathing one day steve when they wake up they're already declaring and saying things they're stopping things in the natural because of what they're saying in the spirit realm that's good that's how it's going to happen so wake up stand up many are starting to stand up they're actually saying things against what's going on and i'm not just talking about taking things to court going to the media who will listen but i'm saying they really begin to stand up and where they live and say things that they're not agreeing with it that this is not god god's got great plans it's important to say god's plans so important if you hear a bad report always give a good report you have to give a good report from god god has us under control we're working with him we're going to see his hand move for us but we have to stand up and be on his side and we have to say we're on his side okay it makes the difference in the spirit realm around you and what's in your own soul is very important so the stand up part is recognizing in your own soul man this just been flooding in i'm getting all this negative stuff out and ask god to put stuff in you can say god i i choose my will to bind to my soul your love your authority the dominion your will your way what i have in christ when you say those things he'll flood your soul with that which will kind of wipe out which is part of the dust thing if you come like that it begins to minimize the impact in your soul and the way you think of what you choose because to minimize that when you ask and bind the things of god to your soul yeah let me ask this about you until this whole wake up season in these last few years i've always been taught that when things are wrapping up it'll get worse and worse one world government elites globalists will appear and they will begin to try and take control and now we're in the midst of the kingdom age and you're saying it's not that time yet so but we know right now cat that there's elites out there i'll just use the word elites or globalists they would rather just control everything and make the rest of us you know serfs and slaves and whatever so is god telling you during this kingdom age that whole elite thing is going to get tamped down destroyed wiped out or just less influential what what are we expecting god to do with these globalist elites who are trying to control us i know that some of them well this is what he said lose their power lose their money and lose their voice okay and you know and and you don't know if it's you're not saying if it's because here's what i'm one of the reasons it's in my mind is when i've when i'm asking this question you said before there's going to come a time when if you want to sin you're going to have to go to a city where that's uh probably because there'll be righteous cities where there's just almost no sin if i am i saying that about right there's yes there will be glories of uh realms of glory cities of glory regions of light it's called regions of light steve and regions of darkness that's what god called okay regions of light will overwhelm the regions of darkness in other words there'll be more regions of light where people will go to live in because of the presence of god sickness this is god there'll be no sickness in those cities wow wow that's so this is why this is why this all has to happen it has to happen so we understand you have to see the division there's so much gray and god says gray is where people don't know or don't care there is an area even in the spirit realm there's those who are in the darkness those who are in the light and then in the middle is a gray area where people can't make the decision or their play back and forth in the camp because the camp of darkness came from the enemy or his camp the camp of righteousness is the camp of light so there's regions of light okay and regions of darkness you'll have to live in the regions of darkness do evil i mean the crime will be outrageous but there will be almost no nothing that is counted as illegal in the regions of darkness wow they can do any kind of perverted awful horrible thing because it'll be pushed back when i said god said crush it and push it back that's what will be happening in the spirit realm crush uh the enemy out of whole regions and push them back until they won't be able to just go into some they won't want to go i say better i'll say it better holy spirit yeah they don't want to go into the regions of light it'll be so painful for the demons to go into a region of light they won't be able to function yeah and what you're describing huh well what you're describing yeah i'm really focusing on these regions of light because i'm saying gee is is the lord saying to his believers his kids of you know children of god is he saying look i'm giving you all of these righteous cities throughout the earth or throughout the united states live in any one of them that you want and you will prosper and you'll you will be no sickness is that what or will some people some people it doesn't sound like your people are being called into regions of darkness to evangelize them but maybe that's maybe that's just my i think that would have to be a very special people that have very special people um the why for the reasons of life is to magnify god's power and glory and i can tell you when it spreads it says it will be known around the world if there's only one way that happens it's not going to necessarily just but by spoken word it's going to be by the activities of the saints of god and i love to say the saints of god because people are already bashing you know nicholas and saint whoever don't you know in the bible we're called saints that's right is that true stephen that is true that's right to the same welcome person if you belong to jesus christ you are the saints of god this is not what this whole thing is about but i just couldn't help but put that little thing out there well you know it's just so well so you're saying that it would be the right thing for christians to find regions of light and just move there well i think it's going to be created by the saints okay okay the glory when these these waves of glory will come to consume us you have to understand i don't we don't have time even in this short segment to explain it all i mean i know robin knows so much he tries to but he can do one after the other you know we do it once a week and that's great because god wants people to be focused on that and again i have to thank you and i'm still going to say people you need to give to elijah a list of elijah's streams because you would not be getting this broadcast you would not be getting powerful revelation and it's nice to have head knowledge about the word and head knowledge what people researched and looked up and seen but revelation comes from the heart of god it doesn't come from me at all okay the 12th grade education that doesn't come from me i can't make it up i can't even think it up the things that god says revelation is one of the most important things you will get that's when it says man does not live by bread alone but by every word spoken by the mouth of god that's revelation he speaks and his prophets speak it but sometimes other people in the five full ministry sometimes everyday people will get revelation but the regions of light and darkness they won't happen overnight just so you know that there are some things that actually will be a suddenly and begin to change right away in this next year it's going to start to change right away but what will build he's building on is he will have regions of light and i was shown those regions of light that's why i can talk about it i saw this whole city the light coming from it was amazing and thinking god you're really in that city this was in the future he was taking me he took me there and i and he said those that's coming from the saints of god who live there that's my light in them operating and living there permeating every structure the ground the atmosphere and he showed me a line of cars coming down 95 who had they had sick people in their cars or even dead people in their cars and i don't do this right now and they were coming to a region of light when they pulled over the line that was the boundaries of that city the people came to life i'm not making it up they were healed instantly or they came to life where's 95 by where is this that you're describing is that 95 runs up the entire east coast all the way from the furthest north all the way down to miami the i-95 interstate 95 wow wow and i saw cars backed up so far and they were bringing people to a region of light that's incredible where god was because they gave themselves to god they had no sin in their life and so stop telling me you can't sin and stop making excuses by saying we've all sinned and come short of the glory might as well keep sinning well you know what you know what you forgot the last part of that sentence what is the sin he's talking about all have sinned and come short of the glory of god that's what he's talking about you're talking about being an old sinner and just sinning all day long he's not talking about that right he's talking about the glory have you made any creativity for him have you used your life to bring glory to of god in this earth that's going to change because we'll know him so well and be in his presence so much and be used by him because we said yes to use us you can say yes i want to be a believer and repent to jesus and get saved but if you want more you go after that more you go after the more but what is coming in this country i know i saw it there will be one day regions of light where people will go to be in that presence of god they'll be consumed by the presence of god if they want to sin they'll have to leave yeah so when you think there's not going to be a change we are not going further into darkness right now it's being exposed god said what is exposed can be taken down yeah so he's so you're so all of these wicked things that we're having is not people's eyes being open so they can see how far we are now going downhill it's not that he's exposing this so people can stop the evil cooperate with god is that what you're saying yes you need to choose what god if you're a believer i'm talking to believe okay the world the secular world is going to be influenced by whoever you know i'm sure they're there's some let me tell you this i have to say this there's more right now living in this country against the darkness whether the believers or a secular world are good moral people they're not necessary believers they need to become believers but they don't want what's being dished out to us that's good probably close to 80 million are against all of it which is the majority of this country but the other side it can't sink in their own minds are seared it talks about your mind being seared you can't think normal so those who have said yes to the wickedness and evil they can only think that they can't even think what is good that's why they can't plan anything good why can't they play any good there's only darkness in them so god is exposing to you all of you it is present this is how satan operates he comes in in certain ways to try to take what he wants he'll always find people somewhere he did way back in the days of noah and ever since then he can always talk people into doing wicked things if they if they have greed in them and have anger or hate or whatever he will go after those people to use them to be leaders but we who are already in the light who are filled with christ can speak against those things i'm not saying you have to go to the doorstep and do it either but you shouldn't just be repeating the horrible things as being said by those people you should be saying what god says he's exposing the darkness it will be taken down he will clean a platform so that we can operate freely in these days of glory coming on the earth he already put part of the glory in the foundation in the very ground you put his hand on it and put it in there so when it comes from above and beneath guest is going to get caught in that smack i can tell you he's got powerful plans he's not ignoring us he is working out his plan and there will be nobody escape there's been a part of all that kind of controlling they won't escape and he assures me of that all the time justice has actually already been sent he's just waiting to release it and that's interesting can you elaborate that a little bit more you said it's been sent so it's here but he's not um initiating it somehow he's not anytime god will send things many times ahead of the time it's activated and it's waiting so you can't see those who are waiting to do something because these are spiritual things okay but i can tell you the spiritual realm is the main realm it's the primary realm not the physical realm yeah the super the spirit realm supersedes it was here before it'll be here after this physical realm so in that spirit realm with how god operates but he uses physical being here just a minute yeah go ahead and get it while you're taking that and um well i don't want to interrupt that thought so go ahead he uses us to carry out things he wants done on the earth so if everybody starts citing oh listen all i can listen to stop listening to the bad stuff people i'm not saying ignore it i'm saying say something against it yeah i get up in the morning i begin to declare the day i declare the day i take authority every day over anything trying to interfere in my life to kill steal or destroy to attack me in any way to take things from me that are mine i command the host to pull down strongholds that's what strongholds do they build their self around you to do something against you but he's given that the army of having to pull them down you can't see him you can't walk up and take something in your hand so some people think it's not real it's more real than you are it was here before you were wow wow go ahead go ahead and finish that well he really is right now waking up not just so you'll be awake and be aware it's so you then stand up and start speaking against it in your own life if every believer just started speaking in their own neighborhood i'm not the darkness in the evil flooding my neighborhood i'm not agreeing with any evil takeover i'm not gonna i'm not tolerating it in any way in jesus name you have left you have like loosed bombs in the spirit realm against the darkness yeah and every evil person on the earth no matter who they are i mean there's a list of names i can't give you but if you if you spoke against the evil controlling them their power they've been operating and will be stripped away man left on their own has fear that's what they live in if they're in darkness and the power that's been given to them through satan or to operate in or demons around them to do that is stripped away this is what comes fear and confusion that's why you're going to see more and more of those people fall upon each other tell on each other that's a good sign that that foundation that god talked about is crumbling you cannot have a foundation of evil it never stands it won't even stand in the day of tribulation because no matter how bad satan wants everybody he's never going to get them and he isn't going to win now that's the main thing you have to remember god is not there just twiddling his thumbs he already had plans for all of this i'm not tolerating evil around me i'm not participating with it in any way whatsoever by gossiping about the bad things going on i i shoot darts into the heart of the enemy that would be satan and all his demons when i say i'm not tolerating the darkness i have power over i'm speaking against all these things have been said that we have to do in the spirit realm i want them to become like dust now can there's people something there's people we know who are evil you said you talked about there's a list and most of us could name nine or ten off the top of our head who we know they're doing evil they're everybody knows it they know their name they know what they're they've been up they know how famous they are for their evil now so if i know let's just say i take five or six of those who i know who i believe are the most evil tell me how i should decree without getting in trouble with god because we're not supposed to wish anyone to go to hell because god doesn't wish anyone to hell so how would we fight against what those specific people are doing without praying a miss or without decreeing wrongly it's what is what they're operating in my scarf's it's they operate because they have given themselves to the evil okay and a lot of them know they've done that and don't care they're benefiting from it some actually have had promises from evil beings that they will be promoted in satan's kingdom which is a joke they'll be promoted they'll be honored they'll have more than anyone else this is what they get they get tormented more than anyone else in hell and satan laughs at them i'm talking about the highest people involved in all this he will laugh at them and he will have them and he will take them to hell when they die that's what will happen to them that is their end and they can't change that end only by confessing to jesus christ and asking him to forgive will they not go there because you cannot commit that much evil against human flesh against babies against god's own against god's own and not think you're going to pay a profit so how do i pray for those people am i supposed to pray for mercy that they'll repent am i supposed to pray that god will you can always pray that but you still i'm not we're not talking we're talking about evil spiritual beings right now all right how do you how do you begin to affect the physical people being used whether by puppets or by permission how do we affect them and their activities you take authority over the demonic influencing them empowering them giving them information their selves as they can be more evil you're taking authority over them okay that's what you're doing okay we can't go into somebody and say to that person say that it probably isn't going to happen are you saying that anyway unless god said this is what's going to happen you would just say i as a believer of jesus christ you can just repeat it jack yeah yeah i'm as a believer in jesus christ see like yeah i'll say it after you yeah you got to repeat it i is a believer in jesus christ as a believer in jesus christ have power over all the power of the enemy have power over all the power of the enemy satan's kingdom satan's kingdom to speak against them to speak against them so i declare so i declare all those operating all those operating in the demonic realm in the demonic realm against these physical people i'm not the same name names against these these people right that i name them i command them to cease i command them to cease i can't command confusion i command confusion to come into the mind of the demons come into the minds of the demons for using these people who are using these people i command i command the host of heaven the host of heaven to pull down the strongholds to pull down the stronghold and shred the platform and shred the platforms of wickedness of wickedness in the spirit realm in the spirit realm to become nothing to become nothing in jesus name in jesus name right now right now amen amen good wow wow ken i want to ask you a question i can't remember if this was you uh part of me thinks i might have heard it through you or i heard it from some other prophetic person who said that they saw a couple regions that they even named that had god had one day turned them into like a region of light one of those that i heard mentioned again i don't remember who it was said that they saw las vegas as dedicated to the lord is that you that was yes it was wow i was actually in las vegas i've been there like what three or four times uh i was invited to speak in las vegas i was speaking in reno on a yearly basis and first of january i was invited to speak out all the time and i would see a lot of of course when in las vegas so let's talk about las vegas when i was in las vegas the first time i went i saw uh demon serpents wrapped around some of these great big old hotels that had gambling and let me tell you the thing why another thing that man is pornography and prostitution is legal yeah it's legal and they follow you around and give you up these packets these groups that's what they do for a living they go around to give it to different people and it tells you how to connect with very defiled defiled places that are already there so i saw unclean spirits i saw spirits of witchcraft i just tell you witchcraft i saw a wickedness in high places and these platforms you hear me talk about it's what it is it's a platform in the spirit realm and these demons sit on them and give orders to the other demons who to mark who to go after because of things that they're doing in that you know they call that the city of sin right [Music] in the midst of walking down the sidewalks and i would every now and then say something against something i saw the holy spirit would say something against us so i'd take authority over it and cast it out of that and it would it would have to leave it would scream and leave it would scream like it was on fire or i would just say fire fire of god and they would all run and scatter they were with these groups of people walking around so these are people had demons with them that were were working in defilement to defile people uh and they paid for the department but these other big buildings i saw some weren't hotels some are places that wicked people go to operate from they have operations there that are secret operations that are wicked and evil and i saw them and these like snakes were coming in and out of these buildings like poking his stuff in there and delivering stuff and coming back and he said those buildings that you're going right now i will take my hand one day and i'll go shh when he did that every one of them were gone every man on every building gone wow he said and i will put my mark on those buildings i would begin to see the mark of god either his own personal star which we call the star of david was actually put on these buildings there there was a cross on some of these buildings stopped saying the cross is irrelevant you're throwing away your whole salvation you need to know that they have crosses in heaven number one jesus christ is a carpenter that's his mark i bet it's important to him he died on one okay anyway i began to see the light of god come first because i talked about it from the ground up and began to consume these buildings and then all the lower level demons who'd been on assignment were running screaming like dust out of this city and god said one day this will be called the city of his son it will no longer be the city of sin i have a market for myself so las vegas is gonna be god if you think you can't affect your city i don't think they're as bad as that place okay the stuff that goes on that's actually been legalized by people who allow it to be legalized when when humans give permission that's why some areas are darker than others they're there in authority giving permission for that to happen and i don't need to say anything about what's going on in other places right now they're giving permission but you have a voice yourself as a believer you have more power in one little finger than all these wicked people do because you believe in the one who owns it all who made it all okay you need to find out from jesus christ what he wants for you what is your point where's your partner and all this i know this is to always speak life and light to people of course you always declare that people will not leave this earth until they've known jesus christ as their savior you allowed you're allowed to offer that but there are some there are some right now that will not have mercy and god has told me i will not give them mercy they've gone beyond what they know that is so defiled and so filled with the darkness and the evil if i don't wipe it out it will continue okay wow yeah yeah and you know i've asked you that question too about that mercy part and i if i believe that you that i'm being correct when i say usually the lord has shown him when someone has become that well known for their iniquitous ways they're by and large gone they've by and large given themselves over is that kind of what you're saying some of them have some of them don't care when they begin to not care about life itself yeah not any form of life they don't care what they do that is so wicked and evil they don't care who dies they don't care if they kill everybody and because if you give yourself to satan satan wants everyone to die i mean he wants everybody off this earth he wants to take over with his own regions of demons that's what he wants but he can't do that he doesn't have the authority or the power to do it he has to use mankind well apparently there's enough wicked people now who've been placed in different places that that can say things to make things happen for the devil but you know what there he's not god he is not god okay satan is not god people he was created as lucifer by god sin and evil was found in him by the way god did not create sin i need to clear that up he one of his accusations bought against him by god was uh iniquity was found in him that sin wicked evil sin it was found in he himself desired and that's why that's the only thing he can say is his nothing else that was made was made by him god made everything in this earth how we use it or what we do with it that's our decision it's our decision but there would be a day when evil that person called evil satan will not be on the earth they'll still be angry people angry leaders in countries who haven't received god when that tribulation does end there's going to be people on the earth that haven't accepted christ they're just going to be the people who will survive it although people always show in movies they've nobody survived well who is christ going to rule over on his throne yeah and it does talk about those people and some of them will be kings and he said they won't want to bring what they have before him he'll say i won't send rain on your land because they'll be wicked evil people so yes he jesus christ is still going to have a say in this earth especially sitting on the throne in the millennial reign it will happen it's after the kingdom age comes that millennial age but right now it is a decision ground and i hear more people who don't know what time it is they say you have to make a decision now for christ well everybody should every day is a good day to receive christ and start operating with him instead of giving yourself to the other side which is you're never going to win on that side but there will be regions of light where people will sickness will not be able to abide not even crime can take place in those regions wow wouldn't that be no crime no sickness uh it's gonna be a little bit like heaven on earth i was gonna say that it sounds a little bit like heaven it's like a pre it's like one of the the single most beautiful place and situation you would have ever have lived in up to that point any human being right this side of heaven yes that is absolutely true and the miraculous will be happening everywhere i i like to say this about the miraculous it will you'll never become familiar every time you see a miracle of god a suddenly of god god given you you know his goodness or moving his hand on your behalf you never become familiar you're overwhelmed every time by his love by his patience with us he is long-suffering and i think i mentioned this the last time the reason why noah had to take 120 years to build the ark wasn't because god was trying to make noah work he offered out of the long suffering of god's own lobby allah 120 years for anyone to repent that was there they would have been on the ark so all those wicked people had 120 years to tell god they were repent for their evil ways they wanted to know him they could have been on that ark so it was their own fault their own a hardheartedness that they didn't god didn't need 120 years from noah to build the ark he wanted to give 120 years for all the evil wicked so yes he is long suffering he does want to extend his mercy but we we have a choice to make with our own will and right now god wants you to stand up with your own and start declaring against any evil present that you're not tolerating it i serve only the most high god i don't serve the darkness i will not tolerate the darkness you just say that in your own home you're releasing stuff in the atmosphere that god can actually use against that physical darkness that's trying to take over this world so i'm not ignoring anything and i am not ignorant and very well informed by the god who made this world but i also know he has a timeline and this is not the end it may be the end of many wicked people but i do ask for mercy you have to add that mercy for those who were sucked into it forced into it threatened into it and they don't want it god make a way for them to get out of that in jesus name yeah for those i suppose that god would seem to have even more mercy if they were literally from birth victimized sacrificed over and all that they didn't even have a choice i can imagine the lord giving them extra you know attention to make sure they had the choice that was never given to them so wow wow well cat you know i think you know we could go on and on i have a list of questions but i don't want to tamp down anything you've already said i don't i feel glad to just ask you if you would just pray for the people who are just what i'm hearing is a lot of people saying this is so encouraging why doesn't anybody speak or why don't more people speak about the encouragement that's ahead of us so maybe just pray for those people and whatever god fills your heart with yeah father i thank you for this beautiful day that you have made no man has made this day no man holds the air we breathe no man really says what can happen what cannot happen only you alone sitting on your throne you have the right to say that you in the word made this world you made everything ever existed your son came and died because you asked him to if you think people that there is not mercy why did he come to die he didn't have to he he agreed to do that but he wasted hell on the third day he took authority walking as a righteous man he was the son of god he's also called the son of man he walked righteously on the earth hell could not hold him so it should not be able to hold you force you put fear in you you need to stand up and start saying i'm not tolerating the darkness i'm not tolerating the evil around me anymore open your front door and kick it out and then you say i invite god the god that created all things his son jesus christ i invite holy spirit to consume this property consume our home and then you begin to build a habitation for heaven which is what we all need around us god i speak against anyone trying to control hurt a maim or steal people's identities their destinies in jesus name i command a billion of those to go forth begin to pull down every stronghold over every single believer in this country and then around this world that is waiting for you to move your hand god open their eyes put the faith of god the power of god in each one of them god they have a right to speak they have a right to have authority through jesus christ i thank you father now i declare and release your life your presence your power your will your way your celebration your expectation for me to run with it for your children to run with it god know who they are they are over the darkness satan is our doormat and any evil thing that follows him or gives permission they better repent if they want to go to heaven or the day is coming justice has been released you're about to move it out and we're going to see your hand move on behalf of this country and this world in ways never seen before in jesus holy precious beloved name a amen wow amen amen amazing this is really really really good today very very hope-filled so hey tell people how

WEDNESDAYS WITH KAT AND STEVE - Episode 58

or https://youtu.be/zf3gPBQDcZk
hey cat hi yeah that was all for free you got to watch all that for free yes it was nice getting to see your staff though people think you know they see you and they think that's it and it's not true really you've got to have a lot of other people to do things that's why it costs money and even people say well why do you have to sell products why do you have to do that and i said well because we put money out we have to pay money out for all kinds of things where you know the building the electricity whatever just in normal things but then when you have staff involved or if you order a lot of equipment and supplies and stuff to produce things you're putting out it does cost a lot of money and god is faithful though but the staff is so important it really is next to your own family i have to say the staff that work with you day to day is so important now i'm going to be in agreement with what you're doing or you're going to have issues to believe in that god has called you and placed you or he has and to show honor and everybody needs to show honor to one another that's something in this new year that we're doing we're going to make some changes that's going to really help everybody have more fun do things together as our staff and we'll be some at some point moving into a building itself this year which will make everything much easier for all of us awesome awesome well kat we talked a little bit off the air we're going to take a twist not a bad twist a good twist but talk about some things i'm trying to decide do i just throw it open for anything first or should i get to my questions that we were talking about off the air what would you like to do um go ahead with the things that are off the air okay let's do that let's talk about that first okay so here's what's here's what the let me just introduce it like this uh we get lots and lots of emails and we can't answer every single one but the probably one of the most common questions that comes out just in general not just with cats show but all the shows is they'll say steve kat said and robin said da da da da da and they and they and they'll list what it is they said and they'll say who's right and basically who's wrong and so i was talking to you about the and i i it's very important for me to tell the people you and your husband are good friends with robin and his wife robin and rob yes we are so we are when you see things really really differently at times uh this is not a friendship breaker this is not a deal break in your relationship isn't it no it's not okay so so what happens i'll just continue with the question then so robin had a very intense word about the president's life and praying for this his safety and all that and i brought that up to you you don't watch because you keep your prophetic uh disconnected so that you get your right from god if i'm saying that right right and i said that to you today about the president's safety and what what was your initial response about that well i had of course um the father will talk to me anything that has to now we know who president we're talking about um yeah anything comes up about him the father will immediately tell me and then i will do what is what i normally would do uh there is a million hosts with him right now in florida let's just say in florida in florida right now a strategic positions strategic places um and their assignment is to be with him as long as god is using him for specific things they will remain so i had done that that was it that was the limit that's all he told me to do he didn't tell me to um and let me say this first i have to say this verse when god chooses people to be a prophet there that's the office of a prophet that's not somebody who's real prophetic or they see prophetic things or hear them sometimes that is their office that is a position that gives them a lot of authority with god he's going to clearly speak to them but he does not tell every prophet the same thing and you should never expect for those who are new to it you can't expect every prophet to say the same exact words about the same exact thing because we're not going to do that i have my whole call in my life as a prophet to train the body of christ to be powerful to know their spiritual weapons and do that type of thing but also to know about heaven my number one call is to reveal heaven to earth i've been there thousands of times so i'm going to speak mainly about that if god has something to say about things going on in the earth he'll tell me i will certainly tell people and right now we have a lot going on in the earth and he shows me different parts of that and what to do about the different things he's going to show robin something different that doesn't make either one of us wrong it doesn't it's just that he's handling that for god and dealing with that i'm dealing with the another part of it hank's dealing with another part of that daniel i mean we all have our part with god but one thing we do do is we know we each hear god and we'll honor them as the office of a prophet and so i would encourage people what you're being told in the moment um you should participate in that like praying for the president of course is always going to be important and i would just say this they've always been trying to take him out people yeah they could get rid of anyone on the earth it would be him because he is a big threat but god's got him in his hand but robin because it was revealed that's what he shares what is revealed to me i will share and you're never going to be disappointed in hearing the voice of god and making sure that it is all covered but by different ones of us so don't expect us all to say exactly the word and i can't validate robin i didn't hear that from god i can't validate hank he can't validate me or johnny in law or any of the other prophets we have we're accountable for what he shows us and tells us to say and to and to share and so that's what we're doing yeah he wouldn't have us here yeah and i'll say this let me add this because there's there's that one that just came up and the one that we get even more than that and you know i i am a perfect piece i'll just tell you i didn't used to be this way but i after knowing cat and knowing robin i'm at perfect peace that robin holds a position that at any moment of the day the rapture could happen i think he but he also holds he also holds and he said on the air that what cat's position in his position could all be true at the same time i don't quite get what he means but i get robin robin knows what he means and i get cat i tend to be like for everything i see you know this says this gospel of the kingdom will be preached to all the world and then the end will come where there's about five billion of the seven who have not yet had the gospel preached them so it's easy it's easy for me to say we got some time we got some work to do but there's an imminent uh in the heart and understanding of robin and so and how about how do you what else would you like to say about that cat i would say that um it depends on the way god uses a prophet also i have to say that um some prophets are more stubborn not saying robin is stubborn in any way but even in the old testament and in the new testament there were prophets that weren't very happy about what god gave them to say but they said it anyway and uh i can just say that you know we we all know that um jonah didn't want to say some things right and uh but god had him in the end say what he needed him to say and i think obedience is very key uh for the prophet to realize uh whatever he is saying i will say it they all also they are still individuals we are individuals like i i'm just going to say this i like different colors i like different food i like different things i i'm not in a box in that in that that we all have to eat the same thing or like the same thing so inside our heart what we've been raised in what we understand and and as pointed out in the word is what we will follow but i was taken on purpose and shown before earth began after even after the new earth is here god has on purpose taking me down his own timeline and so for me i will focus and say what god has shown me on his timeline not any calendar not anybody's calendar anybody else's timeline no matter how many are out there i have to say what god has shown me on his own and on his own we are not anywhere near i know sometimes people are impacted by the things are going on right now he's actually setting up for what's about to happen the next 100 years would be so key to seeing the power and the glory in this earth and god is not willing to give that up he's going to make sure it happens he's going to love all those who stand and speak for him he'll honor them he'll reward them and so you you trust that god knows what he's doing and this only thing that will happen uh uh you know in the end is what god wants to happen his timeline will happen his way and on his day and it says no man knows the day that the lord will return and even that's not the end people please you need to really understand when christ returns is not the end okay that's the beginning of another whole age you know the millennial age will happen that's christ himself sitting on the throne in jerusalem it's going to happen that's a thousand more years so you can't really talk about the earth being destroyed and disappearing and dissipating and i'm not saying robin's saying that or hank or anyone else i'm just saying it can't happen because things have not happened that god in his own words said would happen yet rest assured you're in the sum of the greatest times that are about to happen not the opposite and all those who were were pure to their word and their understanding when they get to heaven they'll still be happy anyway it's not over until the father says it's over and we're in the great days that seem impossible to you but not with god we had some guests that have come to us and especially when we were in the studio not so much now but we had some guests and they would describe several different programs that they were on one of them they had to spell out pages and pages and pages of their theology to tell the this tv station so they would now if they would be allowed you know when is the rapture you know and i don't i've never seen the form but i understand it's very voluminous um and and i think let me just tell you folks that's not us we want to know that a prophet is is prophesying they're a person of good character they have the office of a prophet uh or close to it and maybe i'll put it that way their character is good their reputation's good we're not gonna ask them what's their va what's their uh position on when the rapture is we're not gonna ask him those kind of questions it's one of the main reasons is that particular issue has just split the body of christ we don't want to do that so whatever your position is say it with firm but we won't we will not tend to even major on that issue and i'm talking kind of out of both sides of my mouth because it is true and count you've seen this it is true that i and we do tend to gravitate towards this position which is we're going to be here for a while we've got work to do it is true but we are the last thing last scripture in the adjustment occupy until i come he never said sit there and try to figure out every day and everything and every month so everything lines up with what you you assume will happen you know it says to occupy that means take authority that doesn't mean sit around and wait doesn't mean sit on the sofa it means you take authority you will be active in the kingdom and preach the gospel the king be active and demonstrating and manifesting who god is that's what we're all supposed to be doing right now not trying to figure out if we have to drag our rapture rug out or escape to the mountains he didn't say to do any of that you're supposed to be busy doing things for him until the father says to his son going down you know i think of that scripture where jesus tells the story about there was a master and he went to a far away place where he's talking about the son going to be back with his father and and though the servants you know were given a task to do and then after a while they kept not coming back kept not coming back and they said he's not coming back so they began to beat their fellow servants and put them in bondage and and then then basically when the master did come there was there was trouble to pay you know a lot of trouble you know and and the bottom line was if the masters delay they're supposed to be doing he gave them a job to do they were just supposed to be doing it you know that was what that whole parable is and and what was important was how they treated their fellow servants a long way that was what what he was looking at and and so anyway well we could talk about that for a lot but that's the fascinating thing but just remember folks the guests we have on we don't pre-screen them that they have to agree with everything theologically especially as it relates to that now i'm going to say one other thing and i'm going to admit this is a personal bias we knew and felt absolutely convicted through our prophets there are earlier ones that god was saying he who he had picked the man in florida who starts with the t that was the man and god had not changed his mind so yes in that vein that wasn't a theological position that was like what if you're hearing what we're hearing those are the prophets that we brought on i will say that so you know we're not going to bring someone on um there was someone that used to write for us and he took a position and his position was and this is what he said he said god said deal with it biden's president now it doesn't matter if he stole he's president now pray for him well now he's not riding for us i'm not mad at him i'm not he's not an enemy but he's not riding force he's not a guest so that kind of position we'll take but we don't we won't ruin a friendship over it it wasn't a punishment we just didn't schedule them for the show or we don't schedule his work so i think that makes sense so well kat anything else you want to share before we get into questions the thing i just want to um i have to say what god has said to me almost every single day to keep a heart of celebration because that is his plan and no matter what you see going on i'm not saying it isn't happening i'm well aware that's why i take authority over it all the time uh make sure you're not participating when you participate with what the darkness is or what the plans of the enemy is you're highlighting that you're supposed to talk more about the power and the love of god and god's plans in this time that inspires encourages and it just it just dissolves fear because you know yourself god's never given us a spirit of fear but a power love and a sound mind so what you should be doing right now in this moment no matter what's going on you should be walking in the power of god having a sound mind and no fear whatsoever that's what you should be doing good good good cat well i've got eight-year-old lana if i'm saying her name right with the first question she says did jesus always look young even as an adult so that's her question well i'm quite certain that he could not have been young and gone to the cross he couldn't have been young in the fact that um you know maybe he didn't look totally mature or at his age he was 33 and we all know that that doesn't mean you look sorry sweet and heaven please i probably hear that more than anything else jesus had a light that was in him all the time and and he was a real character he was he knew who he was at that point in his life he knew he was the son of god he knew that all of creation was made by him he walked with such uh confidence in this earth knowing he made this and he came to die for those who were on the earth that was his goal but i can tell you he laughed a lot and a lot of people don't see him that way they seem only serious or fierce you know when he up up ended the whole temple courtyard and everything because they were doing things wrong there that's why he did it but he was focused on what god sent him for what his father sent him for to let people know the truth to let them know that you're not supposed to be afraid even he taught about not being afraid of the darkness so he walked in confidence but it made him a little bit bold he was bold but he was liked very much even the sinners liked him because guess what he didn't speak doom and gloom to people even back then he took about the power of god the life of god the light in us you know why he came and and i think that that probably would set him apart he probably seemed maybe had that spirit of youth in him since he was actually eternal right and i think that's more than what she she's talking about he always had so much life in him there was nothing that even probably was even close to even aging but he did reach the physical age of 33 he was strong even in the natural he was strong he lifted trees he built he was a carpenter he used timbers he moved those himself so he was strong he was in great shape he was happy at the light of god in him uh people wanted to be with him all the time so i can see that he had that spirit of use or life in him so as far as that goes yes he always acted like he was he was never would probably act that he was an old person at all nor did he even think that way he loved to be with children also all the time which to many people back then probably would have been more of a a chore or something like that he never felt that way he liked the life the imagination uh the belief that they had and so in that spirit of youth i think that's probably always going to be in him good good all right now i've got um this is it says i i imc ega so i don't know if that's a name or a username it says username here and the question is is god's hair like pure wool as described in daniel 7 9 says cat cat said she touched it could she run her fingers through woolly hair i guess that's the way she wrote it now i i need to make a slight correction which i rarely do they said white as wool white as well did not say it was wool it is not woolly he was talking about you know that was something he could equate to back in that day you have to understand you think of the culture of the day the sheep the sheep who were like the pure sheep whether they their wall was white it was extremely white and they would stand out with their black faces if you never actually saw a sheep you should go look it up uh back in that day their their their wool was very white and it was highlighted by the black face that they had black wolves and so maybe you never thought about that but god's hair is no way is it woolly jesus is not wooly it said it was white as because on the earth they couldn't have anything else that they could at that day think of to compare it to his hair was not his hair was alive when i touched it life shot into my arm it shot up my spiritual and i'm always um somebody had painted a painting of a horse believe it or not with other colors mixed in it but when i looked at that picture it i saw the face of god in it and uh but i don't want to equate him to looking like a horse but like the mane on the horse was the most beautiful hair i'd ever seen on a horse but literally i don't think they realized that they painted what was imposed over that looked like the face of god i mean it looked like that his eyes are flames of fire real flames of fire but his hair uh the father's hair is like longer than jesus's hairs it's beautiful his fear is amazing but life is in every part of his being and when i barely touch the strands of his hair i even now right now having goosebumps taking him out life was in his hair it was like moving not moving a lot but it was moving because it was life in it it was the whitest white i'd ever seen light was coming from it and i'm sure that's why they tried to describe him he said it was white as wool it's about the whitest white i've ever seen and again because the father can do what he wants to he can either let all of the glory come from him where you see nothing people been they haven't seen nothing but maybe images of eyes or the shape of a head he has so much glory pouring from him but he really wanted to establish to me he has a body his arms his legs has a torso even though he's got the spiritual body it's real it's very real and he'll reach out and he'll hold you when you get to having them if he lays his hand on you sometimes he'll just walk behind me and lay his hand on me i get so undone i'm talking about on the earth sometimes he will come and just visit him briefly and then leave and he actually did that in the old testament so it's not a strange thing and you need to believe in your heart that he cares enough about you he's probably been with you and you didn't even know it if he didn't make himself visible you maybe felt the presence so powerful if you've ever been consumed by absolute waves of love that would be the father standing near you he is love his son carries that love but he is love and and but the light coming from the glory coming from his hair and his whole uh but he condemned that and sometimes when you come home to heaven to stay he will let you see his face he'll let you see the flames of fire that's his passion burning for you but his hair it wasn't woolly and it never said it was it said white so it's extremely white it's kind of long it is is wavy but like i said the waves of his hair and i just was so undone just to be even near him near him at the throne well you this gave me two more questions that had just occurred to me so i'm going to ask him um have has jesus ever come to you in the form of the line of the tribe of judah and if he's coming to you in the form of a lion have you can you see his jesus face in that lies it seemed like what you just described the father's face and the horse or whatever um almost never has he come in the in the no he's just come in person okay i mean like you're seeing me i yeah because you know he has his he's immortal he has his body he has his body back from the grave he's got that body you can literally put your hands in the actually the the the holes are here oh wow if they had been here it would have pulled off on the cross you know that nail could have that the holes are right here and if if you're with him in heaven somewhere and a breeze blows you can see those marks still still in the head where the crown of thorns were but he's so amazingly powerful he sat next to me in my own home and put his arm around me i thought it was gonna melt into the of all the things he said on my loveseat i'll never get rid of that loveseat okay never ever ever get on it and feel his presence today wow when it my home is in stores right now because we'll be moving whoever sat on it could feel his presence just come up around them so his anointing and his presence is so tangible a lot of people said i never could see him if he visited him as i felt him i felt him put his arms around me it's one of the most glorious things and in heaven you can see him whenever you want to but i've seen him in person he's not like i would say he's not a pretty boy he's a strong looking uh god he's strong and he does still have muscle um his physical body he was a carpenter okay his hands looked like they were the hands of a carpenter but if man i'm just telling you just want to be near him i could just say that that's amazing now a minute ago you said um and i never thought this until you just said it you said something like he might have even you're talking about he the lord your father might have even been with you but you didn't know it was him and i'm thinking wait a minute is it possible that the father visits every one of his kids in person i think probably at some time in their life he probably did interesting you have to remember he is the father the father he was your original father no matter who raised you on the earth he is the number one father to you because he carried you in him he carried you lived in him there's no if you could look inside god you would not see there's no distance in him there's no back to him on the inside this glorious river of life and stones of fire and little spirits of life playing in there that's where you were so he carried you before he sent you to this earth and planted you you know in in the womb of the the mother he he carried you and put you like a seed in there and uh and then you grew but he wants you to know him i can tell you that's why jesus's greatest thing himself was he what he talked we talked about the father all the time because he loves the father and that was one of his biggest topics was talking about the father and mentioned him he said he even said there's none good but god he was talking about his father he was good but to him he's the greatest that the father would be the greatest to him awesome all right this is kind of a fun question carla is asking this you know there's that thing i live in texas for a while you know they say texas there's a saying when you live in texas that texas is a is a whole other country you know they call it a whole other country so here's maybe that's what's in this carla's mind she says is there a place in heaven that is like texas i would love to get into her mind and say what is she looking for you know she absolutely is right there is a place like texas there's a place that's got um the same terrain back in this day in this day like i'm in the future talking um on the earth you would say oh there's herds of wild horses running around in texas it's beautiful the river you know the the i don't want to name rivers because i'm not so good with topography or geography down here on the earth and having them really good with it but but you would see certain things in texas in the state of texas there's a strength in texas uh there's a frequency in texas itself that god made of freedom he actually planted freedom in texas and uh not that he didn't put it somewhere else but some there's some states or some regions or even some countries he actually put more of something in the foundation of that whole area and texas wears freedom it does they had to fight for their own freedom back in the day and by the way they wouldn't mind doing it right now but in this part i know because we're just going to go crazy right now we're going to probably get people's people going to love all this and they won't i've seen people went home to to texas it's a whole lot of the west who live in this western that looks like the west and not wild though maybe the holy spirit would show up he'd be wild but but there are areas in in heaven that look like the west they just are and someone in particular i have seen absolutely in heaven would be john wayne i don't mind dropping names people i've seen him there what is he doing making cowboy movies what did he do on the earth all right you use your gift in heaven and i saw him making a cowboy movie uh in this place that looks just like the west except there's no bandits okay you're not gonna roast get scorched be bit by scorpions none of that happens so in your natural mind you always go to well this is there and it's not there it's a glorious beautiful place but it looks just like the west and i happen to know he lives in this part john wayne lives in that part of heaven he loves that part of heaven it's got rivers running through it off of the crystal sea but it to me when i saw it looked like the west and so yes there is areas that look like the west there's places that look like it snows all the time that has fall all the time and like i love what the hell the father explained to me why we have seasons here we have a season you know that comes and goes right like the winter spring comes and goes but in heaven they are like that all the time and the father said when i made the seasons on the earth i took a shadow of four of my favorite places in heaven more than four don't say i said there's four places i took a shadow of four of my favorite places in heaven and put on the earth as seasons wow that's amazing that is amazing now i got to ask you this because there's something you just said you said you're not so good with the topography down here as you are in heaven which begs the question you've been there so many times if you were to sit with a piece of paper could you draw out this is where this is and this is over as as if it was a kind of map would you know where you have your orientation of where you are you know steve you've heard me say many times heaven is the world that's why the earth is round hello flat earth people forget it heaven is the world it's around it's a round or if the earth was made of the shadow of heaven then the earth would have to be round because heaven is so the father's house that jesus talked about in my father's house so many mansions and people have for ages try to picture how many mansions can you get in a building because your mind is earthbound right the the house that the father calls it it's a whole world it's a whole world and i pretty much could draw kind of what's at one of the tops and what's i can tell you what's on the bottom of the world called heaven that's michael's headquarters oh really really yeah because they're saying they're sending them to the earth it makes sense right it's what it's way up beyond anything you can see you're not going to find heaven with no no telescope and no no a satellite or anything you will ever see heaven because it's a spiritual world a literal place where you live literally in your spiritual body uh it's an unseen it says that what was made that is seen was made by that what was unseen so there's a lot of activity up there in the spirit realm uh that you in your mind couldn't even possibly imagine but but god from where he sits can see everything it actually says the earth is his footstool so you know he had to shrink himself to come and walk on me yeah well right but he had to shrink himself and where are his foot touched the mountains they set on fire there was a fire so if you think he's unaware of what's going on you don't know him yeah so yeah so this earth is a shadow and a type of what is in heaven but also even the way he made it so there's mountains there's rivers there's an ocean in heaven called the crystal sea um there's there's the there's places that look like the west it looked like the north it looked like uh the south there's places that look like spring okay there's many places what i could do and actually have sketched myself in a lot of my journals and one day we will actually make a movie we are going to make a movie it would take you to these little places in heaven that i was shown i don't think i connect i could connect the whole world together but there are places and i know what's near them those i could do something like that awesome awesome yeah it never occurred to me that you i know you might if you were going to walk it or fly it on your own go down here turn left here i mean you would know certain places you would know where they are maybe i never i always have people with me so i don't get lost in the airport okay yeah i do remember that i remember seeing your husband take you by the arm through the airport you walked right past this we were okay uh this person lin for christ is their username they want to know what what is the book of records i don't know if that's i don't know if there's a if you've just talked about that i'm not sure if that's the bible term of book of records she wants to know what's the book of records there are so many books i couldn't name them all you think he doesn't have one here's my birthday's right the father is a writer okay the lord was the orator he the the lord likes to speak he doesn't care to write things i just know that about jesus even when he was learning the torah he loved to read read read he didn't like so much to write things that's just the way he was but the father is definitely a writer he loves to write record in old school it was old school to be timeless school i guess you'd have to say it's timeless he loves to write in books there's the lamb's book of life that's a whole different one he has a book of remembrance that's a whole different book but there are things that are recorded there's actually a hall of records there's a whole hall where things have been recorded over time accurately recorded by him so there's a whole hall of records there's one that pertains to you yourself and things in your life there's there's your own book he wrote i wrote i wrote you know your your book for you every day of your life he wrote it in a book that's a whole separate book that's just for you so there are books of records there's a hall of records um there's so many different places to go and see and be be a part of in heaven you'd have to be here for eternity to even begin to be part of it um but there's beautiful places that record things there's different ways no things are like we would say video audio they don't call that in heaven they just things are captured they capture things and say that you don't say they read they don't record they capture them which when they capture something or they have retained something it's what it felt like what it smelled like what was said what was done really uh it was very accurate but for he for himself he does have a book of remembrance that's his favorite book to write in so he he doesn't have to but he does it because he wants to do it and he remembers every kind thing let's just go there every kind wonderful thing you've done for him every person you've helped every person you fed every time you uh picked up a wounded animal i mean animal health whatever it was it was kindness he records and remembers that and then when you pray when you pray and say father uh i really would like to have this or i need this now he goes back to your book and remember says look at all the kind things they did for me look how they treated this person even when they weren't nice so i can tell you that's good there are books of records halls of records in heaven so and but much of it is very beautiful wonderful things it's not always like they're writing every bad deed done when you get born again that's kind of like wiped out if you if you repent for your sins it's like you never did them you need to remember that and you've been sinning lately please go again again please repent again god didn't never give us the ability to freely sin once you get saved people actually believe that and some even teach that he never said that it said since grace of balance should sin also bound in god's head god forbid so because there's grace for eternal life and grace for forgiving you that doesn't mean you should just live a sinful life you're not you're not doing anything good for god even for yourself or your destiny so we're just kind of went there because of the record thing but when you do repent no matter what you've done you sincerely repent god wipes it away and doesn't remember it because remember the books of remembrance are the good things right the book of records might be other things and when you pretend that part is wiped out that's like that you never know and you said that they don't use the word video and audio but they capture it and it's like a 3d movie video thing yeah in our language but if a person goes to heaven and wants to look at their life and they're not going to see sin that was forgiven or they wouldn't even be there but would they be able to see things like that time they went through an intersection and an angel came and did this to this car and would that kind of thing be recorded it would be recorded but also would be all the funny silly things you did like like like what like when you were in your pre-teens in your early days the wow like you know i'm gonna jump this canal like he will see how that worked out and of course it would be miserably fail but you wouldn't get hurt but funny silly things you did you will see that you actually go to these they actually have a place where your friends and your own family when you get to heaven you're not going to escape seeing that movie because they're going to take you to see it and uh it'll be delightful this is like the silly things you did that he rescued you with like sometimes you didn't get rescued you know maybe some of the fashion of the day when you dress like i don't know emcee hammer or something would they show things like um i love anthony by the way he's a very cool person yeah yeah um would they show things like um how the lord when they show how he talked to this person to come share the gospel like that where they would show how he got a hold of how your life was apprehended through the through other people would they show that kind of thing i think you definitely i think you probably absolutely see that i know that you will see this is what you do see you see your life relive with the operations of the spirit realm from heaven's perspective oh every time your life was rescued every time uh a god intervened that you didn't know about you'll see all of that okay very cool very very good born again of course when you get born again but once when you see yourself get bored again you will flash up to heaven in the video or this movie and you'll see how all of heaven celebrated including father's day when you got born again how they celebrated yeah yes yeah that's always been a hard one maybe you've seen what you're talking about but on the earth there could be a in a given day even though we've heard of so many people get saved in china and underground church but there could be hundreds of thousands of people getting saved today coming to the lord and yet when i see that scripture it says there's more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents and and so how does it seems like heaven would be constantly in a state of celebration maybe it is how do they all have a rejoice is it that is that what they're doing is constantly celebrating well they do celebrate all the time people and especially their families or friends or something like they're really going to celebrate uh that their family member got born again oh they can't stop talking about they go all over heaven and talk about even for the people really really celebration is such in their heart knowing that forever they'll be together for eternity so it is a big thing it's a big thing to know that your family members got born again so to use it in a practical way uh let's say i and my wife uh went to heaven one you know events different times now we're friends and uh maybe our grandchild was not was walking away from the lord okay a grandchild now they're all just babies almost but if at the time when that grandchild comes to the lord i'm running up to drain or she's running up to me and said did you hear so and so got saved right is it kind of like that huh well actually what what actually happens is the father lets you know right before it happens and you watch it you go to this design where you can look down on the earth and you declare over your family members and stuff and there's like these columns around heaven and when someone's face comes up on these different columns or like big monitors they know on those columns when it comes up they're about to get born again so they will run into one of these portals that are huge places you walk you run up these steps and look over the balcony you actually can watch your family members getting born again then the whole place breaks it the whole place celebrates every time so if you're there with a thousand people watching the family members you can imagine the celebration going on if they're all there to watch their family members get born again yeah well it's like they're all looking down but they're sitting down wow okay uh this person wants to know can you command demons out of somebody without the permission of the person you're praying for and i guess i mean that's deliverance so i don't know if there's a special what they have in their mind whether it's a ministry setting you can certainly cast a demon out of somebody right without their permission i'm not sure it actually says in the bible that's what christ gives us the power to cast out demons you know he says that right he says that so anywhere where you are if you're in authority if you have the understanding of what's going on usually the holy spirit will move on you to he'll just say cast out that demon and you will do in jesus name i i've done it many times in different places and it didn't even have to be like a church setting it didn't and that wasn't anything that was planned um you know outside of a theater or something and if if it manifests that means if you see it the manifestation of one you you have every right and authority to cast that demon out lots of times people aren't even in control of their own mind anymore you absolutely have the right to cast that demon out there are some people who have them and want them and i know that sounds awful but they do and they know what they are and then they want it you expound what do you mean cat they want them when they know that they're demons what do you mean they want them can you be more specific well i i i don't know about the darkness today but i will just say they they talk about people who who were there's a difference by the way there's a huge difference in being influenced by demons and being possessed by demons okay oh what we're talking about the casting out is someone who has one living in them and you that may freak you out but jesus lives in you okay jesus when you got born again he stepped on the inside of you he lives there people watch what you're saying i always like to say give jesus a good day give your angels a good day your angels were sent to be with you they're also present they're also there uh no matter where where you are your angels are seen i mean they're seen by each other of course as a seer you see all this going on around you is i have to focus sometimes when i go in a place because i'm seeing all this i'm seeing people's angels i'm seeing demons that are trying to speak to people they'll try to whisper things in your ear that aren't gone that's being influenced by one okay a possession is a as a whole totally different thing they probably can't even think on their own or do normally even natural everyday things needed for them to live in a situation like that you better know the power of god you better not have sin in you and try to cast a demon you just need to know that's not going to remember the seven sons of skiva go back to the bible uh they thought because they saw you know all of them cast demons out they thought they could do the same thing and the demon came out and jumped on them i'm not trying to scare you i'm just saying what's biblical you can't live a life of sin even as a christian which sounds crazy and think you're going to cast demons out they're going to come after you so if you're operating if you're operating and righteously and you have authority and you know you have authority and a situation like that that would be the most natural thing for me to say i cast you out in jesus name get out he had me do that in a whole congregation and this whole massive congregation of like 700 people three demons literally ran out of the people and those people were set free instantly from the the the the the demon that had controlled them either they gave themselves to it and i'm saying you cannot just go play around in the darkness people you should not have an ouija board i am sorry that's how you contact me you don't want one of those you don't want to mess with witchcraft i just have to be honest if you want to be full of god in these days and walk in great authority you don't have to be a prophet to do that you do need to know who you are in christ and who christ is and you walk to please him you you have authority over the darkness the bible says so you do and there's a whole list of things that you have the right to do as a believer it doesn't have to be necessarily a five-fold person in the ministry you as a righteous person have great authority in the earth but you can't play in the enemy's camp in other words you can't decide well i'm a born-again believer you know i'm operating i'm reading my word i'm i'm declaring things and and then decide to go to some wicked evil science party a guest and that guest you wouldn't want with you i'm not talking about a physical one so you need to you need to be accountable for your life and actions when you get to the age of accountability that means you know the difference and you know what's right or wrong don't play with the darkness okay if you want to be safe and powerful don't play with darkness um you just don't want to do that and i don't even know how we got into all that yeah but as far as casting demons out we we have authority to do that jesus those who followed him believed in him who had repented of the sins was living righteously they had the right to do that and remember the one man he cast all the demons out and prayed over him and then he sent him to do the same thing because he'd received christ but you need to know who you are who christ is who is christ he made everything that ever existed that does exist and will ever exist that's who he is when you give yourself to him you get everything with him you're not giving up your few little sins you had or you feel little things you like to do and play in you're getting a life eternal to one day being immortal and this is what you're giving yourself to it's not just oh no i have to read a bible it's not that it's who are you giving yourself to because one way or the other you're going to participate in the darkness or you're going to be in the light with jesus christ so i would say run after him get along and say i want to know you jesus i want to know you more i want to know about you i'm going to be like you you're going to start having his presence show up because of what you're saying okay what you say matters in this world and so don't be bashing trashing swearing profanity is how's language people i'm sorry i don't tolerate don't ever swear about me don't swear around me i'll cast that on you that's good all right now i think i may know where this came from but let's see okay so you said you said in the past everything in heaven is alive the flowers don't die the grass is alive things like that and this person may have heard that but maybe i don't know if you said the angels took care of the flowers but this person says what do angels have to do when they take care of the flowers do they have to water weed fertilize so i don't know what you might have said did you say the angels take care of them okay so what did they do they care for them uh they'll go and sing they'll release the life of god they'll go visit them i mean there's there are some that their assignment and there's some that care for the waterfalls there's ones that care for the meadows and the flowers and the creatures god doesn't have to feed them it's not the physical food you're thinking on you're connected to earth okay i'm talking about heaven the life of god feeds everything in heaven you eat in heaven because you love to eat you don't eat because you have to do it to live so these these things he made that he imparts the life life of god or joy they may bring waves of joy to whole meadows and the flowers begin to sing with joy so there's things that they're assigned to do in heaven but it's never going to be the fertilizer fertilizer they're not going to dig and put plants in there okay uh if you're a gardener in heaven you'll speak and plants will begin to come up on the ground oh wow you're gardening with your with your mouth by speaking new things that's right very cool very cool very cool um here's one i don't know if this is a child or not but i know that's a serious question but this is does anyone go to heaven and not like it and now do they what no does anyone go to heaven there is not one single person who's ever moved to heaven and lived there and not liked it okay there's so many things i don't even have time to tell about or share about that exist there you're living in an atmosphere of joy there's nothing in you that would despise or not like it's not even in you i know in your head you can't understand that because i know you go to a store and you go i don't like that outfit but i like that one no i would never wear that but i sure would like to own that it isn't like that in heaven okay you love everything you have your favorites or you'll go to different places to get favorite things that you like because everything's just given to you things are created to me but it's given to you but you're not ever going to say i don't like living here that is impossible you are so filled every bar part of your being is filled with the life and love of god and if anything you love more you love your family more you love god more you love his house the world called heaven you love everything about it you get to go on tours and nothing costs anything there's no money in heaven uh everything is freely given people share the gift that they are that they were on the earth that only they use it in more fantastic ways than they would like an artist doesn't just have to paint on a canvas their paint floats in the air whatever they use to make things it's just there they paint with light they paint the sky of heaven and it's there for a while then it fades and they paint something else there's no what there's no way you could not love being there yeah that's amazing all right let's do this this is the last one but this is a good one um never heard this one but this is this is to you cat christie's asking on one of your visits to heaven kat have you ever had a family dinner with father son and holy spirit what did the conversation can sound like i i've never had a dinner with all three of them i haven't i have visited with them separately and they've taken me different places in heaven i've i've spent i not i don't think i ever ate with any of them okay i think i've been in a bakery with jesus one time just because he was showing it to me he loves sweets yeah every baker that comes to heaven he's going to visit their shop really great i've been in the the i've been in the um mansion that is jesus christ has his own why wouldn't he he lived on the earth as a person okay he served god while he was here on the earth he has his own yes he's in the throne room a lot but he also has his own place what does he do he throws events there invites people just come home to heaven and let them meet all the prophets and all the stuff i've been there and all he served was desserts people so i hope you like dessert you had every kind of dessert imaginable on this glorious mansion and when you walk through the flowers are so high they're all greeting you you come in this beautiful carriage and then he sent for you to invite you to his place and there's people there you probably always wanted to meet if you said i always wanted to meet elijah i always wanted to meet queen esther i wanted to see david they would definitely be there for you and then you would all enjoy desserts on these tables and he's going to have dancing like beautiful dancing and i know in your mind you're thinking all these different styles of dance depending on what you like there's nothing defiling there's nothing degrading in heaven but beautiful um they dance all over heaven all the time usually from joy from celebration but everything you you usually think about is equated to what is in the what's in the in the um i'm trying to think of an earth ward right now they would compromise the area this is the best i could do of the throne room and even that would be hard for you to do if you have not been there the throne room is alive it gets huge it grows it's round the throne is in the middle of the throne room it's high and lifted up there's like platforms columns platforms columns and there's people and all different they're either worshiping or dancing or leaving sweets for jesus seriously all the way up the steps to where this massive throne is the father sits and his son sits next to him uh you have to walk past these living creatures that are so stunning to get up there and your eyes cannot contain uh so it's not like there's little small spaces and there's no place for you it's not like that you begin to worship everybody raises up off the floor the seraphim come down out of the glory cloud and they're on fire with passion and love for them with sin on the throne there's no way you couldn't love being in this place and so anyone who has someone there don't ever feel sorry for them that they're living they're existing to live you never die there's no thoughts of death there's no thoughts of harm nobody's ever sick nobody lacks everybody still wants to help one another with their events and stuff like that there's joy celebration no one is rejected no one's rejected everybody is cared about and loved and and the creatures you also can get to know all the creatures that they are not talking about the living creatures they're too busy i'm talking about creatures all over the world called heaven and the friendly forest is why they call it that in the valley of the falls uh there's just so many beautiful places and fun places i can't leave out the fun okay so no matter what when you know someone who's going and you know they're going i celebrate and i've been celebrating over marcus lamb recently a great man and woman of god have gone home to heaven my whole heart is so full for them of the glory they will experience just being in the presence um of the father of the son and holy spirit is still there people i know his base of operations is on the earth so don't even go there with me the holy spirit is an unlay unlimited layered being i hope that does something to your natural head unlimited layers of himself doesn't mean there's a million of them standing around it's not like he's here there's a million of them around him it's not like that the way that he is he has unlimited layers of himself where he sends that layer of him that looks just like him and is him he knows everything there here's everything there so when you invite the holy spirit to indwell you guess what you don't get a piece of him you get a whole of him in you that's good good good good yeah so when the holy spirit you know he's when the holy spirit lives in you that's not some euphemism or poetry it means he himself is there uh we would we would use the word in bodily form except he's a spirit being so it's not and he's killed him as a body yeah okay so spiritual body he's literally there the person of the holy spirit you get hold of him to indwell you and let me tell you he almost never stops talking to me he talks again a lot most of the time you hear him like out here speaking to you um and sometimes he'll even say oh don't turn there or don't go there or stop uh that's usually saying him saying that to you even if it's in your spirit you hear him but if you give him permission i want i want to end with this you if you're born again and you're not spirit filled invite holy spirit to indwell you you really must it's the power of god in you it gets you bold the power of god now lives in you and you have access to that and you can you need to say to the holy spirit i give you permission to talk to me even when i'm not paying attention and if you say those words to him he'll do it when when needed to protect you when needed to encourage you he will and and then you'll be the more you recognize he is there uh i talk to him like i do to jesus or the father um i've seen the outline of his being he's very powerful looking too he's outlined in fire he carries the fire of god uh on him he is god and uh they have the ability to step inside of each other i've already been in the throne and saw the father sitting there jesus gets up and steps inside the father the holy spirit comes wherever there goes that steps inside the father and then the three in one wow oh wow a five-year-old could understand that a five-year-old can understand the trinity and yet man in their natural mind still trying to figure out do they have three heads how does this work and then they step out and there they are the three individual gods the godhead but one thing is for sure they love you they care about you and they don't like the darkness that's good that's so good cat wow that's so so good so so so good all right well we got about a third of the way through the questions because i'm just enjoying it takes it longer than i love it i love the time we spend with each one but you know it's going to take us another couple hundred shows yeah he made me he picked me he made me first of all if you can imagine i'm so full of detail that's why i have a photographic memory so i never forget anything i saw heard or experienced but i grew up like really really i was really i was high maintenance because i knew things no one else knew and the family i knew things that my siblings were doing they didn't want me to know um but i also knew what god was saying and um so i was not normal even when i was little i ate once a day i slept four hours a day i was up all night long uh even young my mom would still always been this way i thought that was new in your life you've always been that way huh but i'm a detailed person which is good for god but when you're with somebody trying to be over a project or you're out picking something up from the store you're detailed then too you know i'm sure that sharpens my husband no i don't want that one it has to have this slant has this this hue this this tent this is not over here i don't want that and so i'm like that too so you get both of me you get all of that i but but it works well with heaven that's why yeah well i mean you're a revelator but you have a photographic memory and you are a photographer because to boot you i don't know the verb forget details and while you're not forgetting natural details you're seeing supernatural all around you at all times yes and i can't even i can't even you know your brain must be i mean it's like living in two worlds at the same time can't you are you um here's let me use human you know terminology language yeah while you're remembering in a in your photographic memory now you're seeing demons and angels and things as you walk around the room and this cruise ship or whatever are you recording and not forgetting what those as well do you remember what which entities were doing what how how far does their memory go well when i'm on the ship they try to not be there oh they do well they already know me because they know that i have this relationship with jesus christ they know uh they already know who i am i have they they they have blacklisted me because they could get cast out uh or i could say something that would freak them out you know the spirit or whatever uh and i won't tolerate when i get up in the morning say i'm not tolerating any of the darkness anywhere near me i take power over all the power of the enemy command the host of heaven you will shred mesh bash and trash every demon that even tries to come near me shred platforms that have been built in the spirit realm and some of those were on cruise ships because for for whatever reason uh people got away with certain things and then there's these spiritual platforms they would be destroyed if i was on that ship wow so so they don't have maybe as much activity because i'm in a captive place and there are captives already if i am there that's good well you know that's that's a thing in scripture whereas it was paul paul i know and such and such i know but i didn't know don't know you so they do know the high level uh apostles prophets just holy people men and women and children yes they do is it such that when they get on this cruise ship they have a meeting and everyone knows where the holy people are on the ship how does it go it's because of how much light you have coming out of you okay i mean they already know people who don't have christ uh it's not like they're not living obviously their body's living but their spirit man really doesn't have a lot of life in it and sometimes they may follow those people to see if they can get them pulled into something but i take authority over the whole ship wow wow wow yeah boy i would love to hear that you know i'd love to go to heaven one day and see what happened but i guess the evil you don't see the evil replayed that someone won i mean right if you go to heaven you know the only time you might see something like that is if he allows you to see what your prayers resulted in war without heaven against the enemy i think he probably it's not like it would really be there it would be something that you would get to see happen like in your life when you're praying and you were praying for somebody i think you do get to see the destruction that your prayers called calls again the enemy the spiritual darkness i'd love to see that so i'd like to see that now all right cat awesome awesome well tell people about your two websites cat we got revealingheaven.com on the screen tell us about that one yeah revealing heaven.com is where we will be putting our events which we are still going to plan some for this coming year we're going to plan some events here in the city i've already got invitations to go places um in this year so we'll be going to those places but we also have that's where our store is and our stores got very powerful things in it and you may have said well you've had some of these same uh if i've got some cds and dvds i've retained is because it's powerful truth that people need and there's always new people finding out i don't want them to lose the revelation all of those cds and dvds are not head knowledge not none of them are head knowledge every one of them contain revelation i don't know if i'm gonna have one here i thought i have one you don't know what happened to it but uh like we make things like this thing for your car that says i don't do demons this is a car magnet and we have people come up and take pictures of them so we have products that represent heaven on the earth or or sayings that the holy spirit has said and then ker.com is a whole separate website that is to get spiritual revelation from almost everything in there is revelatory we do have some images that you can see of things that have been made to represent like portals in heaven different things on the earth that i've seen so you can go to catcure.com and look at that there's also interviews on there like patricia king and other people have interviewed me those would be on catcure.com there's also truths there's a place uh that you can go watch quite a few videos and learn how to declare over your family members to be born again uh how to ask for grace for um uh i'm trying to remember what it's even called uh um abundant life abundant life grace after abundant life grace i think how to lose stuff out of your soul i think is on there um but those that is a platform where you can learn spiritual truths of revelation uh there's also all kinds of other things to do but it's the only place and i keep saying this it's the only place online if there's any other place online that's been made out there on facebook youtube that say give to me here that's not me okay catco.com is the only place you can go to and click on the treasury and give online all those other places they may use my face but they're not me i'm also going to say i will not tell you to go give to some missionary camp those people are trying to steal money from you or they're saying that i said to give to this group or for this cause that's not me and i don't do it on purpose because i don't want people getting ripped off yeah so go to category.com if you want to give and i do want to end with this make sure you are supporting elijah's an elijah streams thank you like steve said they they can't know every single person they put on there but they do know if they find out someone's not living right that's what they're saying we're not going to put them on there they're not going to even promote them i wouldn't either and sometimes people go through stages of their life where they're not hearing right or whatever reason but i tell you god calls him a platform for the prophets to speak for him and if he cares about steve and he put that in place then that is something that is definitely valid to give to your seating into the lives of millions of people when you give to him and helping to support his staff and future projects like going to israel if he ever does another tour of israel make sure you get to go on that tour it's amazing and so many things we do we speak for god we're not god but we speak for him we allow him to speak uh the best we possibly can because we want you to know him want you to know the truth the truth makes you free not lies and deception so you have a blessed day and yeah thank you kent i think days definitely never stop declaring declaration declaration is still prayer declaring declaring and decreeing over situations is still prayer it's a really high level of prayer that's good good good cat thank you again and again thank you for those kind words just now that was very nice of you and a quick reminder that wanda alger will be here tomorrow she's always very good and got good great revelation so god bless you all thank you again kat and we will see you all again tomorrow bye

this weekend in arizona and phoenix arizona as a matter of fact when i'm speaking uh on saturday afternoon about 305 arizona time um somewhere about an hour down the road president trump will be his first rally of the year about an hour away so um but we're asking for prayer for that and support for that that you know when you we we are going to run that show i mean the whole conference on our rumble channel so you go to the elijah streams rumble channel and you'll be able to watch that live free people have to pay to get in but all of the well-known speakers and you know mike lindell clay clark general flynn amanda grace is all almost always there and lots and lots of other well-known speakers um i think uh clay said that don don donald trump jr is going to be there what those things those you know they're flexible you have to see what happens at the time but anyway that's that we appreciate your prayers for that i really do appreciate it it's only a 15-minute slot but you know there's a lot of people watching so i could use your prayers they wanted to claim asked if i would introduce kind of officially the modern day prophetic in prophets many people there are have not been introduced to that and many people that go there are not even saved but so trying to figure out from the lord which what are the best things to say and show and tell so that people can be initiated into the prophetic so prayer is appreciated all right let's bring kerr in here hi hi cat i guess for you it's good afternoon it's about two to something your time huh yeah it's a little bit past morning for me morning is noon [Laughter] yeah and it's about eleven i guess we're yeah you're exactly three hours ahead but well welcome to the broadcast as you yeah as always uh you're looking chipper as always so you guys are still gonna are gonna move very soon right to new offices or a new home or what we're moving to a new home first and after that uh margaret's already been looking for office building we can't start up with just something small we we've gotten so huge inside where we're at now and so we're moving out first so we'll be out all of our stuff will be out because you know we've been living here for 15 years actually where we're at but the office took over about six and a half years ago and then it fastly it took over every room in in this place so we call it the office not even our home right now but we will be moving very shortly and then probably within a few months after that we'll be moving our offices yeah wow well you've really been in a growth spurt so have we i mean this year we you and i saw a lot of growth didn't we that was amazing and he would have grown about the same time we did so we we just kind of did it together didn't we we did do it together it was god's plan yeah it was it really really was we both know it we both felt it we're both experiencing it now so yeah well um go ahead go ahead people should understand i know if you look around only at the world what the world is seeing or even this nation like i would say everyday people uh a lot of people who are prophetic or who just really prayer warriors understand god's about to do something powerful and that's why the enemy is showing himself off but as god says he's only exposing himself people that's probably as far as i'll go about that the enemy's been exposing himself this whole last year and a half and that makes them an easy target for god of course you know i'm talking about god the god of heaven and earth and he continued tells me um that i have to be prepared for the acceleration will be very quickly after major things begin to happen we want to keep this broadcast on here so uh but you know i've been talking about that all along people who've been listening all along i'm so grateful for your support for your prayers i know steve is but god did actually plan this together because it all started way back you know back in 2019 this whole thing kind of started what we're doing now and um and god just knows what he's doing that's what i can say i in my spirit have so much celebration and excitement in me i was with god last night and my office right now is so filled with him uh in here i i can't help but have excitement on the inside because that's that's how he feels and so he says i have to have you into a bigger place for you and your offices have to be established uh so we're not margaret i think we're thinking about something smaller and god said no you're gonna accelerate very quickly once you leave here personally and when you leave here in the offices it's it's about to be very great these are great days for people they're not the sad fearful days and you know speaking of how this all happened to both of us this year i it's very clear to me that you know i call god one of his my names for him is you know that's not like i say dear manager but one of his descriptions to me is he's a manager i've asked him to manage my life and so he literally withholds i mean he's blessing the socks off of both of us but he could do it he could even double it right now but he knows you need that often so he needs you to get into that office into the home and until he just goes and it'll double triple quadruple you know so yeah it will this is this is the air this is the time and season and years and breakthroughs where people are need to hear the prophet's voice do you sense that after the switch after the right person is back in office do you expect that people will need at that point to have more prophetic words or less prophetic words i think they're going to begin to run after the true prophetic word of god that has been proven through all of this that we've been going through i already happen to know they are literally going to run after people to be near them to hear them it's going to increase and not just that steve salvations will begin to increase greatly not because it's the last day where we're all out of here this is god preparing for what's about to happen for several generations of i know this also that a lot of uh prophets are being born right now as we speak uh in of course as babies but they are prophets and god is about to flood this world with the prophetical and prophets so i hope they're ready for that and i do know as a parent who kind of raised one and who's now a mentoring grandchildren who are prophets wow they're not normal they don't start out normal and they're going to be very powerful let's say 10 20 years from now there'll be such powerful voices in the earth we do need you steve we do need the elijah's elijah streams will be a known door opening for those prophets who are really hearing god and are living the life it's going to happen we can't stop it from happening no one not anyone not spiritual or physical in this realm or in the unseen realm can stop from god from doing what he's going to do you know and when god god began to birth prophets even out in the desert with moses to the extent that a couple people started prophesying he didn't have permission and they were cattle on to moses and he goes what are you jealous from my account he says what that all god's people who are prophets this whole desire and moses was himself a prophet but he said with it all god's people were prophets that was desire and you know on on the amount of transfigurations it was moses the prophet he was also a little law giver and he loved the prophet and god you know what moses did on the earth was important for him to say that was super significant so yeah well you know uh we're we're going to jump into some questions about heaven and related things anything else so make sure we're giving you a chance to say anything you were going to say before we jump into those oh no that was it just this acceleration that's going to happen is why a lot of people i i'll just repeat what god said uh one day it will be hard to remember these days we just went through except the powerful part except the god part of them uh we'll be doing so many powerful things and you know it is god's heart that all prophesy it says that that all prophesied and my heart is everyone knows the truth the truth comes from you know jesus christ he's the spirit of truth we know holy spirit we know the father who all revelation flows from it is there and i'll just say there their heart that we all know truth that we all hear him and receive revelation because of the days coming and all the flood of people coming into the kingdom we'll have to mentor them not we not just me but the body of christ will have to be at a level where they can mentor these people uh coming on board into the body of christ that's good well we're in it together this will be fun so a lot of people if you're new and you've not seen cat before cat over the last 20 some years maybe more a lot more than that he has been to heaven and thousands of times would that be about accurate thousands of times that is very accurate so uh and i think one of my favorite little clips from memory is he is a visit to heaven might be you're in a grocery store picking up a can of food or something off the shelf by the time you put your hand back down into the basket you've been to heaven and back and and they counter like that might last how long and how long would it seem a visit like that lasted when you were there i think the only way i can gauge that because they don't have clocks in heaven anybody there's no calendars or clocks in heaven uh god does things according to events actually his whole timeline that he has behind his throne and embedded in the floor of the throne is god's timeline but it's done by events that are planned down the earth it's not like i know the hebrew calendar you can tell me all about that that's still the earth thing i'm talking about a heavenly from a heavenly viewpoint god has events already playing out he's already seen him he's been there he already knows uh what's gonna happen it's up to us to choose to be a part of it but i only know if i've been there uh a while is how many places he shows me like if he catches me up and he's talking to me about a specific topic or uh an event and then he shows it to me he'll take me forward in time to show me that event so i can talk very clearly about the things that he's shown me and then brings me back it probably wasn't very long earth time um if i've taken to three or four places which he can do and with no time in heaven he can totally do that but i realize while i've been there for a while all those seconds in the store have gone by i've been taking the three four or even five places in heaven that literally exists and i could draw a map of those places i literally could i've actually done that a few times just for my for myself i've actually drawn what's around certain things in certain areas of heaven but one day we plan to have huge displays not just in our offices but we'll have other places and um facilities where we actually people can come and see things happening as they when it looked like when they happened in heaven what happened literally looks like to walk through it so it's a good thing i have photographic memory yeah for sure for sure by the way someone asked me a question about your photographic memory uh my my wife's brother kind of has that and i'm sure there's there's there are degrees of photographic memory does that mean that you never forget anything or are there a certain type of thing you always tend to remember it but you can forget other things what does that mean in your case if it is regarding heaven i've never forgotten any single time i've been taken okay wow wow wow you could even identify that on that particular trip you went down at the different places i can i can't identify it what it felt like what the aromas i smelled uh the flavors i tasted uh what the atmosphere was like what what what it looked like what it felt like um what other places what people were experiencing there how they felt about things how relationships happen how transportation happens how heaven operates i could just go on and on because he has shown me he sent me as a revelator of heaven that's his title he gave me and he takes me whenever he wants to and i never say no wow yeah i love that i love that okay well let's jump into some questions about heaven and these are some are questions about heaven and others are questions about things you understand about the word because god's explained it in heavenly language okay we usually do a couple of kids once this one there's a one by a child and one by a young man so here's the my grandson i don't know his age deborah says my grandson wants to know if dinosaur dinosaurs have feathers and are there bright colors in heaven so that's his son i don't have the grandson's name well i can start with the colors there's colors in heaven that don't exist on the earth everything we have here is a shadow of what is in heaven and i always like every time i say that the holy spirit makes me say this on purpose that heaven is a world that's round like the earth is round and he is adamant about saying it's not flat and i know some people don't understand that there's a whole group out there the flat earth society uh they think they can figure that out and i went well they're not god and they didn't make it and i happen to know that it says that he sits above the circle of the earth and i guess they think that's a flat circle i don't know the holy spirit always wants me to bring that up because there's people who are in that and really believe it and uh but i'm telling you the earth is round it is a world uh the father's house is a world it's not just a building and so whatever he makes or comes from his being one of the things that comes from his being is the rainbow and i tell people if you want to see what it looks like go watch the northern lights or find it online the northern lights it's not just a stagnant rainbow in other words it doesn't just sit on him like this it moves in and out in waves the different uh layers of that rainbow and anything it touches will turn that color and so let me tell you everything you would never expect trees can be teal color uh they can be pink they could be gold creatures they're different colors so yes there are vivid very beautiful colors in heaven all over heaven there are some dinosaurs that have wings and some of them have feathers in them some aren't some are made out of whatever whatever substance he made them out of but they're totally his dinosaurs he made them i want to add again the holy spirit says please tell them they didn't come from hell there's this thing called reptilian seed i don't know where that came from i've never heard god say it he made the dinosaurs he put him on the earth the first time he made it wow oh good good good okay now this is a young man his name is elijah and people have different questions that i wouldn't have this question hopefully i'm going to turn to it and the question is do people blink in heaven now that wouldn't be mine but he wants to know if people blink i'm pretty sure they do blink you still have your eyelids in heaven your spiritual body looks like you except better better meaning if you were older you're going to look young there's is filled with the life of god you do kind of glow a little bit uh people do kind of glow in their spiritual body but you can clearly see that's who that person is you recognize him it says in heaven you'll be known as you were known there's a scripture and so it's not like you become some little wispy thing you're living in a spiritual world that has substances it's almost like being here but better okay no darkness there of any kind but you have a life you have a mansion you live in the mansion you eat food you you wear different clothing um so i forgot what the question was yeah oh you will blink you will blink when you see some of the things he's put up there i mean a lot of people are like they're like this i mean you still have emotions you don't have you know like fear you know or anger or stuff like that but you have a lot of you get excited and intensely excited and undone and overwhelmed because of the wonder and the splendor which you're not going to ever find out what that means to you go there so yes people definitely blink they blink they laugh i mean they laugh a lot in heaven and they get overwhelmed and undone by the goodness of god by the waves of love that penetrate every bit of heaven up there so it's just an amazing place to live i will say this again what jesus said tell everybody on earth you have to make a living in order to exist but in heaven you actually exist to live to live you know my wife and i said this all the time we said that when we went to her parents memorial they both passed away within a week of each other in october we both said since we know cat and what we've learned about heaven our entire how to a demeanor at someone's death our understanding is so much different there's so much less grief there's so much joy when our loved ones go go to be with the lord because this is a beautiful place yes their body is here they're reading means they're buried we buried the dead we bury their remains but they're not there they're with the lord if they're if they're safe so it's an entirely different thing and cat you know i've never even thanked you as much as i want to thank you for for changing are just giving us the truth you people don't know you've actually paid a price to do this so we appreciate that we do appreciate that very much all right now this is an acquaintance of my think i'd be better just read it because it rather than try and tell it so here it goes and this is from oh dear holly he goes i had a question for you or for cat i was wondering when we pray over areas like for me it's praying over ohio and indiana against tornadoes do we need to be called to a certain area or can we pray over any area the reason i ask is because i felt led to pray over my two states and have since i was very young but i remember and she names the name of a teacher a prophetic teacher he said i remember years ago this teacher saying you're asking for trouble my paraphrase she said if you pray over territories that you're not called to pray over which i did after kentucky got hit so hard by tornadoes in december they stopped at the ohio border i prayed for iowa and minnesota when they were expecting an outbreak of tornadoes and immediately after that i got covered so she's wondering did she do that to herself because she prayed over a state that she didn't have authority over that had nothing to do with you except you probably terrified the enemy by doing it any believer has the right to be over the weather i will say this the area you live in the state that you live in you have a greater level of authority but you really can take authority and i do want to remind you the holy spirit again is saying something to me said remind them jesus was in the storm when he stopped it so you have greater authority wherever you are present so no matter what state you're in if you're present when something comes up you totally have the right to take authority over that system that storm uh there's nothing wrong with that jesus was definitely over the weather no matter where he went and when we were in israel i spoke and dispelled the fog that they said would be there for 25 minutes around the boat and i spoke and within minutes it was gone i know i have authority over it then me would like to think you don't and people who've never learned this or even searched out what it said about that you should understand that that jesus is an example of what we can do that's why he did these miracles it wasn't just so he could be known it was so that we also could step into that place like him walking the authority he gave us if we have power over all the power of the darkness and the enemy the enemy causes severe weather that's not a natural thing and i know the scientists would say it was but what they're not right they don't know understand the spiritual side of things or the unseen realm uh whatever you will take authority over and of course you're not giving yourself to the darkness i have to add that you can't play an enemy's camp and sin all the time and think you have authority over anything you you know there's a reason why jesus said to walk a certain way and if you walk in the spirit that means you're aware of it of what's going on uh you know you have authority in it and you operate in that authority you can you can make an effect on any severe weather no matter what it is wherever you are personally but other than that where you live like floor is my greatest level of authority although now he actually says i speak worldwide about things myself and and that that person i think that said you were asking for trouble that may have been he may have been talking about the demonic hierarchy like spirits of wickedness in high places over certain areas he maybe they meant that uh i know there's a thumb now taking authorities over principles and powers you better have holy spirit with you and listen to the protocol you go through to do that but i'm just talking about right now about the weather any weather system that would be destructive you absolutely and you proved that by what you did and we have way too many testimonies that we we know that we have the right to stop storms shred storms or even shred them and lower them and send them to places like that need rain we've been doing that this last year well you know um that that begs this question which you actually just addressed is if someone let's say it's not the weather and i'm thinking of a friend of mine david he's with the lord now but he told me years and years this is like 30 years ago 30 40 years ago he was in new york and he decided he was going to take on the principality over new york city and he was a seer he was a singer so he saw it and he came after this thing and he goes i know you know he took a you know within a couple minutes the car was stopped he was arrested for some trumped-up charge and put in jail he said i'll never do that again so is that what you're talking about he took authority where he didn't have authority and it was like almost arrogant that he could do that right if it is you know i was contacted by very high level people in the intercessory arena and asked because you know six times he has had me through his protocol unseat principalities i never once on my own would even think to approach them you know anything attacking me anything coming against me or my family in the demonic arena or in the arena i absolutely have authority over that but principalities and powers are very very high level uh demons they don't live in hell they sit on thrones over regions where there's a lot of darkness and there is a protocol to do it but you better know what that is and god usually will appoint me and tell me to go there and what to do about it so i would not and these people in high places on the earth said how did you do that and not die because they know people who died they try to do so sometimes it's more serious than just you think well i'm over all of this and i can be uh you know i can tear down the high things and uh i wouldn't try to do that if you don't have a lot of maturity in you you're not hearing what god is saying um i think you know depending on what he did when he was in new york city he may have been arrested just by if he's getting out standing and yelling and stuff like that as something out in the public that may have been the reason why that happened but i totally would not go against something that god didn't tell me to i'm not afraid of it i just am wise and so yeah people have died from doing that and so i do have spirit realm boot camp every year twice a year and uh if you hear me doing that somewhere you should come because then you understand the operations of the spirit realm uh different levels i don't run around naming demons you know i don't just don't do that i just take authority where i don't where i want authority but the special commission to go and do something i have to follow exactly what he's saying and it does happen but it's not like i do that all the time so i would definitely tell people don't step out on your own power and your own understanding of who you are think that you can pull down those high places there is a protocol but if you don't know the protocol i would encourage to do it but so that's what i did i followed god's protocol in 2000 my wife and i went to we were offered to speak at a place in nigeria and one of the evening is there's 15 000 pastors and leaders from africa at this place in north area and they decided to tell the whole group that they were going to take on and they started talking about the god of the moon and blah blah blah and i turned to our intercessor uh lisa she was also see her i said is this okay for us to do and she goes i wouldn't do this at all so we just kept our mouth shut let them do what they were gonna do i didn't feel like they had authority i don't think i and i didn't have the authority it wasn't false humility it was like no there's no way i'm gonna dance on this i got sick after that trip as it was you know and i didn't so anyway we got to be you got to respect that i think it's jude that says even even michael the archangel didn't cast a railing judgment against satan but said the lord rebuked you so even there were certain respect of the high level so all right yeah so the weather clearly and i don't teach people how to get protocols they don't ask me yeah that's god wants you to go put on principality he will tell you the protocol on how to do that but as far as the there are different levels in the darkness just like those different levels and there's different levels in business different levels in the in the christian world uh the medical field you wouldn't send someone who's an intern to go do open heart surgery would you and that's kind of what you're doing if you think you can go up without any authority remember the seven sons of skiva let's just go back to the bible and they saw you know peter paul casting out demons they thought they were going to go try it they didn't have any authority themselves that hadn't been walking in that authority increasing that authority and that demon tore them up so there you go in the bible you have to know what you're doing peter and paul weren't attacked they weren't assaulted they knew exactly what to do and how to do it and they had walked in that for some time in their life so it's probably a good subject to bring up because in these days of course there's stuff everywhere you're seeing and there's a big difference in trying to take authority over a person doing something wicked and in the spirit realm maybe we'll do another whole session on just that that would be important but yeah um people who are wicked in the natural the reason they're like that is there are demons around them affecting and controlling them we can speak against that part of it but i wouldn't uh there's nowhere in the bible that i saw where it said go attack people in the natural so even sending the host even sending the host if you know there's a person over here that's being affected by demons and you say i'm sending the host to take out the demons that are causing him that's one thing versus i come against the principality that's that's empowering those demons don't do that right well uh i think you can send the host anywhere that you're impressed to send them and if they have authority from god to do it then he'll allow them to do it and if if he hasn't given them because even they have different levels of authority the army of heaven i'm talking about because if you remember you know even gabriel had to send for michael for help going back to the second thing you were talking about he couldn't face these high-level demons coming to bring that message to daniel he couldn't do it himself he called for michael when michael showed up let me tell you i promise you they left okay michael's not going to come in through all your peers people just so you know that but anyway there are levels in every type of army the natural army the darkness the light and so um you need to understand some of that stuff before you try to go into that but sending the host if you feel impressed to send them to certain places if they have been given the right by god to take down those things they will but the other things that they can do to protect you to keep you to pull down evil spirits in cities and around areas if you have family there or friends or god has signed us on you to pray for a certain area of things are going on you definitely can send the army there to pull down strongholds uh that's different those are still the demonic it says that our weapons they are minded to the pulling down and strongholds that's still the demonic that's still the dark army but the the weapons one of those is the army of heaven and so there are certain things they automatically know they can do and take care of um don't let that stop you from starting to be involved with the commanding the army of heaven right now in this time they're set but you have to know what you're doing okay you still have to know what you're doing and even what is the purpose of your own heart are you doing it yeah and i've heard you talk a lot for the very first time i ever heard you talk publicly you cautioned and exhorted and warned and taught people you better not have sin in your life if you're doing some of these things number one they're not going to sit there and fold your hands i think i recall you know you tell them the word says that um the army of heaven the host is the army they're always called the host in the bible the host hearken unto the word of the lord why would they do that because he's the lord of hosts jesus is over the entire army of heaven no matter where they're sent he is involved with that they hearken under what he says so if you're not talking powerfully you're not talking in the word in the word pray praying if you don't have a strong relationship with jesus christ hearing him clearly about things some things like if you want to send the army to go attack someone down the street you don't like them you don't like that they're loud noisy or crazy or whatever that army number one's never going to attack humans so that's why you have to speak as if the lord would be saying it then they will do what you're saying it is it is also there's requirements to do have authority and operate in it or we'd have just chaos everywhere against everything even heaven does have an order and protocol is the best way to say that their army operates by protocol like the earth's army can't take orders from just anybody you know the military can't they have to take from those who have the authority to give the orders and those people have to operate even in the military in a certain way to be able to to head up our military uh some private's not gonna run out there and start yelling at the generals on people to give orders in the in the natural army well the same thing happens in the spiritual army so you definitely need to have a greater understanding of what you think you're going to take down all of hell along the lines of the host you've taught and shown pictures and all of that about hosts that impress themselves in cloud formation so that you can see that they're there okay so if someone's watching this today and they've never heard that i just wanted to say that part but this person says every time i look into the sky i see or seem to see a dragon in the clouds are there hosts that look like dragons yes there are they're called aragons loki wow and they they ride the host sometimes we'll ride them let me get a drink i'm talking a lot um the hosts are transported to the earth to do battle in many different forms one of the ways they love to do is they ride the air guns the air guns are actually part of the host they're not just a ride they actually wore themselves against some of the other demonic part of the army but i actually have a picture of some of them writing i'm going to be posting some new pictures or maybe do a i don't know a host id workshop somehow uh online and let people know um but i actually have pictures real pictures not doctored up pictures you're talking to someone who's clueless about anything on the web or even doing stuff or art i am a photographer old school taking pictures you know with my film camera and stuff like that i can't i couldn't in any way nor do i have time to learn how to fix things or change things uh the pictures i take are legit the real god sends them i take the pictures and he allows me to show them but there are some called eragons and i have a powerful one i think it was in the calendar we did on the host coming in and i was actually in the store this big um parking lot where there's like i don't know on office max and michael's and other things and it's a great big open area so it's a good year to go and see what's coming and usually they'll follow me or come because i'm there but i got the best picture ever of this one aragon and you would call him a dragon uh and dragons thing about dragons that i do know is there is one who's one of the gods in like these um asian countries and they have five toes i'm getting real specific okay uh none of heaven's aragon's and for whatever reason they have four toes not five it is very interesting it was something the holy spirit showed me and i went and looked and i checked out and it's absolutely true some of these dragons that they show and you know i do also want to go back to the word that that god called satan the old dragon and there's a reason why he called him an old dragon an old dragon would be toothless they'd have no fire left in them they'd have no power left in them at all if you think about why he called him that god has a behemoth which is an aragon he has one himself and uh but they're not bad in any way are they bad uh so that's just uh not that you should bring well i will go into another time but you shouldn't bring certain things in and just hang pictures of stuff on your walls i definitely wouldn't hang anything that was a attached to witchcraft in any way you don't want to bring that into your home just don't do it derek prince found that out himself and one of his stories he told but but the five-toed dragon is worshiped in other asian countries as a god uh but all of the aragons that fight in heaven or come from heaven have four toads and their whole purpose is to work with the army of heaven so yes there are some you actually can write on them in heaven when you when you go there but they're called eragons that's true wow that's good and someone else i don't remember if i ask you this but a different question at a different time wanted to know if satan or if the enemies of our soul can he press things into the cloud too would someone look at that and say well that looks like demonic or or does he have not not the power to do anything with that what would you say oh no they you know i i would just tell people the spirit realm all around us is unseen there's more of the spirit round than the physical realm you need to understand that the physical realm was stretched out like a curtain before god even put these physical uh planets and stars before he put them there he actually had to make a physical realm it talks about in the bible where he says uh you know he stretched it out like a curtain that's actually what he did before he made the earth and everything uh he spoke the word and the word actually stretched the curtain out and that's why it says at the very end of the bible he will fold this all up like an old garment which i think is pretty cool yeah so further on in the early in the bible it says you stretch the stars and plants out like a curtain and but at the very end it says he will fold it all away like a garment hey there's that curtain he's folding it away and going to make all things new so that's just to let you understand in order to have this physical plan and you live here in the physical body you had to make a physical realm the spirit realm always existed it's a real realm everything in it has substance it's all spiritual it's all spiritually um living but that's why in your spiritual body you literally live a real life in heaven if you base down here you have the best bakery in heaven uh if you run rodeos you have rodeos in heaven but the the bulls and the horses are talking to you the whole time you're trying to ride them and you're not ever going to win probably up there but but there's a difference your spirit is unseen right now but in heaven is seen everywhere this what you've to clarify that can a spirit can an evil spirit do something with the clouds that someone would identify yes okay and i do have i this is kind of tight i do have some pictures of them in the clouds i'm not showing this yet because yeah but they are and sometimes like like in you might think if they haven't been photoshopped in some severe weather you might actually see some faces off the darkness okay and some of those in those situations but there are more of the hosts on the earth than there are the demonic but yes they can also but they don't do a good job of it i'm just going to say there's a big difference in how they try to make a shape because some of the hosts can get together and make some kind of really fantastic shape in the clouds um but the demonic when they try to do it they don't want to they don't work together they just don't work together they don't like each other they don't i'm talking about the dark army the eamon the demons they don't like each other they don't care about each other they don't want to work together at all and so what they try to do together usually doesn't turn out really good and i want to clarify that one thing that you said because i'll make sure people know what you're referring to maybe you need to give an example but you said derek prince learned the hard way put something on his wall what are you referring to that someone put on a wall that someone should be because we were talking about clouds and all of a sudden you were saying this i want to be sure people know what you're referring to about don't put them yeah back when we were talking about the dragon thing okay yeah he and this is a story he told himself of course we all know he's in heaven right now uh he did get them i think he inherited them from his grandfather or something when he he served i think in one of the wars in an asian country and brought back pictures of these um i think they were the five-toed dragons okay okay that's what he put on the wall yeah and he didn't he was clueless and you know derek prince was one of the first ones to talk about piercing the darkness he actually he began to uh to look at that listen to god and god taught him a lot about the darkness and the spirit realm and the darkness and yet it changed everything when he put him on his walls he didn't say to god are these are these acceptable he just put him on his walls even i think his wife got real sick his friends began to hate him his business was falling apart and finally and every time he walked by him he would admire them i just tell you what he said himself he would admire them aren't they beautiful oh i love them you know i mean he was actually and finally he went to god and said why is my wife so sick why have my friends all left me and god said you have a defilement and you've put on your walls you need to take them off he said what he said the dragons you know mine walked he cleansed his house he cleansed it and immediately listen his wife was healed back his his business and his money exploded because he had obeyed god and after that he that's when he began to teach people be careful what you bring into your home if it's statues of other gods they wouldn't bring it you know what god said about that himself you know he said to break them up and not even have nothing to do with them it isn't this is a thing it isn't like a statue of so-and-so you know not real god that thing itself wouldn't hurt you but the spirit attached to it and all these um things that are going on out there no matter what demonic influence it is it's not i'm not going to name certain religions right now because people will be focusing on them and some people are very nice and some of them not everybody is against people a lot of these people in false religions are actually kind they don't understand why people hate each other but the point is this your life is run by the devil the devil is over every antichrist spirit and the antichrist spirit means they're against jesus as god and so he introduces all these false gods some countries have hundreds of them and they they worship them they bring food to them they make temples for them and that is not helping their life in any way whatsoever because they have no power to save no power to heal and that's god's point you want to bring something in and here you are honoring something that is an image that is worshipped as a false god you know not to keep them in your house my grandparents were missionaries in china my father was born in china i remember used to see this massive ornate wooden carved hand-carved chest and it was out in the living room when we go to our grandparents now they were devout christian people but a whole lot of evil got into my family and now years later i'm kind of they're all going to be with the lord but there was a lot of evil stuff that entered in as you know i've adjusted to with my about my father it makes me wonder did them sitting here displaying these ornate things with these tibetan gods or these idols and these things and i would go to their house and they're all these chinese things hanging on the wall some of them were probably fine but others were these little ornate gods and then one of and my grandfather's brother gave us that gift and i mentioned it before these ivory little gods from india because they're all the missionaries went over there and got all these goods so they could show people isn't this beautiful it's crazy well we could could talk ourselves into thinking that's just pretty and that's nice some of them you're right some of them are harmless some of them are beautiful uh people and some of these foreign countries have such amazing gifts to create they don't know god for who he is i'm sure if they did they would be putting images and some who got born again i do know have have done the same type of thing but they put the image of christ they put the angelic or whatever of that on there but the thing is if you don't have discernment if you're not a seer and you can't see what's around it i'd be very careful about what you pick up i'm not saying i don't like people thinking you have to look at every single inch in your place or every single thing you have but i would say if you know it to be something that you know is not a true god why have that there instead of something that represents heaven or god which is one of the reasons by the way by god is about to flood the marketplace with all kinds of things that represent heaven that represent them so people have a choice because i understand right now in our marketplace especially the one right now there's not a whole lot of choice to bring light or life or hope even hope into people's lives but it does matter what what you do portray it matters the images you wear it matters the images you have put on your skin uh i'm just saying god marks people himself sometimes but what image are you betraying is it's for the kingdom of darkness or not sometimes people need to break off any connection with what they've had put tattooed on them and say i break any sever any connection with that i know people who were affected by that so image people used to say image is nothing but actually according to god image is everything it is everything okay well what you represent or what you believe sometimes or people will think that so we went a long way on that whole thing yeah that was good that'll give people some tools to deal with now this is a i was talking to my staff beforehand this is a fascinating question i would have not thought this question would ever be asked but listen i think it's really interesting she goes i love to knit and crochet she was excuse what is it going to be like in heaven for a knitter or a crocheter i believe that i will have a mansion for my knitting interesting what are your thoughts i agree if that is a gift that she has and she loves it and she's really excellent at it i think she probably will have a studio what what he does he gives everybody gets a mansion but part of that property or even part of that mansion definitely would be you know i know you've heard me say people have restaurants in heaven they have studios they have galleries a lot probably number one what she would be knitting would be alive the threads she would knit together could make different tunes and become a symphony when she's done with what she makes it could also portray something that would represent images of things that are already in heaven but i do know paintings when you paint in heaven they come alive i mean they're on your wall but you can see movement you can see life in them i am quite sure that what she would make or knit would have a life in itself wow very very cool um okay this is an interesting uh question a viewer asked one of the nine gifts of the spirit would the seer gift fall under i don't know if it has to fall under one of those yeah i kind of thought you'd say that but i didn't god gives that gift god and only god and people go well you know there's mediums out there and other people who can see those people were given a gift by god but because the other person got overtaken or used by the darkness then that gift could be used for that purpose god makes seers and sinceres it's important and you can see why all the stuff that everyone has benefited from that god has shown me or that i see and understand it's important to have seers but that gift is only given by the father and he puts it in you before he sends you it's in you and there are different levels of seeing sometimes you'll see something every now and then sometimes you'll see parts of things or not sometimes you'll see the darkness sometimes the the uh or heaven stuff i see everything all the time like the whole entire uh unseen world that's why you're called a seer a seer sees the unseen world and um you see transportation you see beings going back and forth you see how they operate which has always been powerful for me growing up i was powerful not powerful like i came against things not that kind of power but the powerful knowing who i am and i know the truth already because i've seen the truth you can't hide the truth from a seer so being used on the other side in the camp of the enemy and people think i'm doing this beautiful stuff for him but they they connect with spirit guides and stuff like that god doesn't have spirit guides people he has the angelic and mess mattresses for him he has holy spirit so even that is such a small area in the life of almost most christians don't know um they think when you say the word spirit you're being filled with the holy spirit which are very major to be filled with the holy spirit or the holy spirit himself i'm talking about the unseen realm when i say the spirit and the seer sees it you see it clearly some see maybe not so clearly but someone who's been doing a long time and understood that and then trained by god what to do with that stuff it's very powerful i don't think a seer has to come under those any of those yeah yeah there's i think there's a fault the false isn't the right word there's an incorrect understanding that any gift must fall in those nine that gives thousands of gifts right yeah and things that people can do in variations of the things so yeah because people are sent as a gift themself you know what they can do what he has given them to do or make or use for god's purposes we are we are sent every good and perfect gift comes down from the father of lights those lights are you when you lived in him and before he sends you to this earth he puts a gift in you and having you use that gift all over having to do things so those are uh i think you're talking about spiritual gifts i think there's nine gifts in the spirit spiritual gifts but we all in the natural age have a gift also but those nine gifts of the spirit are different than god making you a certain way and this is what he made you he made me a seer it's not i saw before i mean you know i got saved four years old but i still saw in the spirit before that i was a seer because he sent me that way so i was two and three i'd see angels everywhere but at four i gave myself to christ i saw him step inside of me and i knew he was in there and people couldn't couldn't get me away from him because i saw him step in me so well you know the paul talks about that's not one of the nine groups of spirit that's just something god makes you as a senior paul talks about uh you know he prays that god will give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation that you may know him better but this when whoever gets the spirit of revelation there's about a zillion ways you can revelate or receive you might have a vision you might have dreams you might suddenly know and you don't know why you know right so two ten people with the spirit of revelation they may not look alike at all as far as how they get it that's right right yeah revelation is revelation is god speaking all revelation comes from the father it does uh of course his son was filled with revelation but revelation is the mind and heart of god himself of the father and when he shares it so you openly understand the scriptures you understand his plans his will his way uh that's what revelation is so powerful it's not head knowledge it's usually something you didn't think of but it's so great and it's usually simple it it gives you something greater um to understand the word of god like i said but revelation comes from god most of the stuff i'm talking about there's no way in my mind i could have thought about it or even tried to figure it out so revelation definitely comes from god and there's many people who get revelation yeah hey you know that that causes a question that wasn't on my list because it happened to me this morning i woke up in the middle of the night in the middle of the night there's a praise song it's like i'm praising but it's an old old praise song i wouldn't have thought about i wouldn't have known and all of a sudden the words the music i'm hearing it in my mind and then this then i went back to sleep because i started to praise him and i fell back to sleep i wake up a totally different praise song is going through my mind also when i hadn't thought of for months and months so what is that is that god asking telling my is that god causing praise to rise through my spirit while i'm asleep or is that god telling me i need to be praising how would you discern that i think that's him filling your spirit with it while you're sleeping uh people who really seek god even while you're sleeping he can impart things into you and if you happen to wake up in the middle of some of that something like what you just explained some people would get up and just start worshiping it's always it's always important to worship you know i i worship in many different ways with god i don't have a voice that i could go sing on a platform people would probably laugh at me and i wouldn't do that to you anyway but on my own of course i do jen's laughing behind them right now just as a funny note just to be funny when i was first speaking and i didn't really have a clue you know how to do it and do any of that the revelation was in me but i didn't really know so we went to somebody's we used to do a lot of home meetings don't ask me to do you couldn't get the people in your home they'd be all over your yard but they were hooking me up for a mic and it was right before worship was supposed to start and jen looks at them and she goes she's not leading worship right now yeah i'm not leading worship right now no no no we wouldn't do that so we're both like warning them no we don't know no she doesn't do that you couldn't you could have just made a joyful sound you know but some people's joyful sound is better than other people's joyful sounds but sometimes sometimes steve when you wake up first thing i will just say this and this is truth when you first wake up those first few minutes are so key to you probably hearing god very clearly i would wake up and say do you have something to say to me and i'd be talking to god this is something you want to say to me many times i wake up and the minute my eyes open he starts speaking to me and i have found it's true when you're between that window of the natural realm and the spiritual realm sometimes he can actually show and tell you things if you would wait a few minutes and ask him he probably wouldn't start to get have like visions or have encounters so i've never really told people that but when i first wake up which is my few hours he's already even starting to speak to me that's when he walks through the wall of my home sometimes he'll just start sharing things with me i haven't connected fully with this natural in other words i haven't left my room i haven't gone out into civilization yet it's really one of the best times to begin to listen and see if he's saying something and you're so open already that when you when you wake steve you're already hearing what's going on around you that could even be some activity of heaven around you happening and that's why you're hearing some of that music so it could also mean that that's really good good good teaching good to know because you know all i could think of is god must want me to worship and so i began but next thing i know i'm about i'm asleep again but if if i were more intentional and say don't let yourself go to sleep praise him on purpose and don't go to sleep that probably would have been a good deal or you could just say steve do you want to share something with me right in the middle of it say father is that you wanting to share something with me you might be surprised that's good okay that's good good i'll do that so let me just see i'm cutting notes here make sure all right let's see here's the interesting almost funny question is there gravity in heaven oh well um there is a form of type of gravity i don't think they don't call it gravity if you if you jump and you want to go down your purposes go down you're going to go down okay uh you in people i have learned by this time that a lot of people do fly all over heaven you just can you know when i first started going in the beginning there's been so much more he's shown me i'm so busy sharing what he showed me in the beginning and things that people really should know about i don't always get to add stuff but many people most people whenever they when they've been there for a while they realize they can just like fly around heaven and stuff like that if you want to leap on high things you also can do that there's buildings floating in the air i know i've said that you just leap from where you're at and you leap maybe 20 30 feet above the streets or wherever and you can actually go into the building that way and when you come out you just jump it's not like you're going to fault the speed of light and smash yourself but you will go down that's your purpose to go down and you'll go down so it it's it's a different life completely well yeah you know when i picture heaven i'm thinking this beautiful scene this building this something but in when you're in heaven are you seeing activity in the air all the time are you seeing it all the time oh yeah you're seeing stuff going on all the time in the in the i call it the um i call it the celestial round would be all the sky of heaven the celestial realm wrapped around the world god heaven there's almost as much activity up there there's buildings there's streets to go on in in the sky there's shops to go into oh there's all kinds of things to do you can imagine you're not bound just to be walking on the ground uh you travel on light you travel on sound you travel on music it's just almost inconceivable try to take i can't wait till we start making movies we are going to make movies god's already informed me of that and you will actually see life in heaven lived in in movies but they haven't liked this one he said they exist to live they didn't live until they got that yeah anything i'm not going to argue with people i have to always say that you'll know your body sleeps in the ground your body does but you aren't your body your body's wrapped around your spirit man you were always a spiritual little being a little one and then when you came to earth and he gave you this body this body adapted to the appearance kind of of your spirit man you become like one then of course when you die your spirit goes to heaven your soul is in your spirit your soul is not sleeping okay that's not right your soul is never going to sleep it never sleeps your soul's awake even while you're sleeping now that's why you should play awesome music and feed your spirit or somebody words of god speaking or something or i'm just tell people feed your spirit at night by listening to something that's powerful or beautiful that would that would um open up you know more of your spirit to hear but but no there's so much activity in the sky of heaven i think half of half of heaven is in the sky the other half the beautiful ground of heaven so yeah well yeah the stuff in the sky like that it makes me think of movies where they make everything in the air but i know i don't normally think of it that way but okay this one caleb wants to know has cat ever seen michelangelo or any other famous painters and artists like van gogh and chris you've seen a lot of people but there's thousands you haven't seen it's not like you've seen them all have you seen any famous artists like that or old time they there are there are of course there's famous artists who went there many of them knew god and were close to god themselves i can't at this moment i've seen work done by some of them but but i can't say i literally saw that person and you're right there's actually millions of people in heaven right now people picture heaven with a handful of people in health full of the masses but there's there's a lot of people that live in heaven and heaven is so huge it's bigger than our own galaxy the world called heaven is bigger than a galaxy there's no way okay you've been bent but the few places but significant places like the throne room and other places that are in heaven god wants people to know uh it's this earth is a shadow it's just a shadow of what's there the beauty splendor wonder the activity that your loved ones are getting to do some of them actually ask things to be prepared to bless you when you get there there are places you know he says i might we go to prepare i go to prepare a place for you that place is not just one mansion i will tell you that again on the ground or property which could be miles if you want miles around your property and have beautiful things on that property that you love to do or enjoy doing there's doors all over the property just floating about a foot above the ground when you walk in that door on your property it takes you to another part of your place it could be somewhere else in heaven wow wow so your place can be okay so i've always thought well i'd like to have a place in the mountain in heaven a place on the valley and a place by the sea whatever because that's what i would like here but you're saying you don't go out through that doorway that portal to go to another place it's all your place is that what you're saying yes you're right it's all in your place it's in another part of heaven it would be in another area of heaven but when you go through that door what you're seeing is yours that's good yeah yeah okay uh here's a woman joanie who says cat i've been praying for the gift of tongues and it hasn't happened yet what can i do what can you tell her i would say you know of course when when i was 18 um when i got filled with the holy spirit of course by that time i had seen i was raised up in um a godly home not perfect home been in a godly home where god was so real to me i mean he was very real activity activities of heaven they were real i knew about hell i mean my dad explained all the stuff says he was very very close to the father to jesus and so it's his mother so we have generations of being connected to heaven even while living on the urn and so i i can just to tell people that um i already forgot the question about about how to get how to speak in tongues she hasn't been able to speak in tongues yeah the holy spirit's greatest delight is to indwell you i can tell you that he waits with anticipation once you're born again to invite him i i would just say i actually just invited him to indwell me and said i invite you to indwell me holy spirit i want to know you uh i want to i want to feel your presence around me and and to you know i don't think i spoke in tongues at that very moment i think it was probably later on in the day i was just thinking about god thinking about that i invited the holy spirit and opened my mouth and out came just two syllables and and that was beside myself excited i just kept saying those two syllables and pretty soon more read and more were added sometimes it happens different ways some people are instantly filled with the holy spirit and your that's they call that also your they can call that your prayer language it's another word for speaking in tongues that the devil is terrified of he doesn't want anyone to have that power it's power it gives you power it gives you confidence in who you are the holy spirit will help lead you guide you he'll never leave you but there's a difference and when you're born again he comes alongside and it says that in the bible when you're born again the holy spirit is alongside you and he will help you but when you invite him in when you invited him to come in he came in for whatever reason you didn't speak at that time i would encourage you to keep pressing in i wouldn't keep asking i know back in the day i was taught you ask until you get you ask for hours if you have to i think it was the holy spirit i don't know what i think about that if you sincerely invited him to come and indwell you uh it empowers you uh you you feel different number one you feel like the power of god in you life god in you you feel increasing in presence of him i have no one of my own sisters had that experience and i think it was some sometime i think she's had a few syllables here and there in tongues but let me tell you the power of god and the prophetic began to operate in her after she invited him to indwell her this this is the truth and i know that we we it says the evidence of speaking in tongues the evidence that's that's the outward evidence and sign to people around you knowing that you received him i don't think that stops you from having him inside of you and you may not have ever heard any pastor or preacher ever say that before but you invite him to indwell you he's going to come in if you've got christ in your heart he's going to come in and then i would just say holy spirit show yourself to me demonstrate yourself to me open up my mouth that i can speak you know speak in tongues and then i would just say just start praising him i would just start telling people say when i would help people get tongues sometimes you lay your hand on sometimes if people already have a lot of that they can lay hands on you and then then you just start speaking in tongues so you can't say don't say there's only one way to get it the one way you have to get it is you are born again you've repented of your sins jesus christ is in you he's your savior and from the moment you decide to pursue i want to speak in tongues i want that holy language and i will say this also when you pray in tongues the devil doesn't know what you're saying the devil cannot understand tongues which is why he doesn't want anyone to be filled with it it's like the perfect prayer language that you know when you're praying what god is and putting in you to pray it's very powerful but i would say if you've already asked to start thanking him is a better term to say thank you for the evidence of speaking in tongues i've already received you and you need to say that the holy spirit if you've invited holy spirit i choose my will to invite you to indwell my person to to come on the inside of myself that i might understand clearly and and have more understanding in the presence of god and then you start saying to him thank you for indwelling me and thank you for giving me open and loosen my tongue that i can speak in the heavenly language i would really encourage you to do that that's that's really really good all right this is maybe this is the last one um we get a number of questions that relate to night or things so it says i know there's no nighttime in heaven but is there a place where it is dark where you can see neon lights or city lights like it is not like it is dark sorry like it is night because sometimes it looks beautiful looking at night lights there's not darkness like we have the dark of night here it's never that dark there are times where i would have to say uh the light isn't probably as terrifically bright but i will also say this the first time i was taking this somewhere in heaven where i saw those lights you wished you could see you saw them in in daylight what you would call a daylight they were so bright wow it streamed out of this whole place you saw these brilliant lights everywhere coming out of this one place whoops where people would go i'm always putting my stuff back together one day i will have an actual studio people there you go uh but i saw these brilliant lines i went what is that place i mean i was i was unknown it was so beautiful you saw beautiful images coming through it but these rays of light it wasn't just oh that's a pretty light it was moving in and out of this place and uh so trust me even in light the light around you their lights if they're going to put a light show on they can totally they do fireworks in heaven not the way we do but they have fireworks in heaven and they see them clearly but there's like paler colors that come through the different parts of the sky and different parts of heaven so i'm sure and and if you want to see outer space from heaven you have to step through this big doorway that's called the observatory you're out in space you're not just looking at it well and that didn't you say out in space it's not dark like we see space now but it's isn't a color to it oh if you're if you're out in space around heaven you see the light of every star no matter how far away it is the lights of the stars the nebulas the the all the beauty of the art i call it a space art that god made up there you're so far uh right now they call it deep space or when they they go up in the spaceships uh if they're bi planets that make light or if they're by moons like circling them or something they have more light it's different in in the celestial realm around heaven you literally are stepping out into part of space and seeing it for yourself so you can do that you don't have to have a telescope to see but you do step through this doorway that's another whole part that you can see beautiful stars and nebulas and stuff like that is there a color is there a color there's color there's color everywhere out in space really and they even sell calendars you might want to go get some that show that they have some out right now uh in the stores for the 2022 now i'm pushing someone else's product you can actually probably order just called the galaxies it could be called the galaxies or something like that and it's when the um when they said some of the sometimes i'm not good on head knowledge when i'm talking about revolution they send the ships out to seek out places and get pictures of them without light things like that and they've got beautiful uh beautiful close-up pictures of a lot of they're called nebulas they say they're made out of gas but i know that you know particles of gas coming together and make a perfect eye out in space i'm sorry people that just doesn't come on its own yeah things like you would look in those calendars you would see stuff like that stepping through the observatory it's called the observatory there's no telescope you just walk through this ancient looking amazing doorway and you're out there in in space seeing all these beautiful things wow wow well kat i appreciate that so let's tell people about revealinghaven.com what do they get at revealinghaven.com uh revealingheaven.com is our original website it's where you find our store that we have a lot of products and i will show this as an example we like to create products like

spirit force teaching spirit force is the number one revelation god has given me to train the body of christ how to be a member of the army of god that it talks about in the bible i'm not talking about heaven's army you as a member of the army of god on the earth will learn how to use all of the weapons he gave you spiritual weapons and our his plan is for us to crush darkness that's the enemy the spiritual darkness and push it back and you have the right to do that as a member of the body there's a lot of scripture in all this but the training is the most important part and you will everybody know we've been getting phone calls from everywhere people want to sign up for it and we'll have more information on spirit force but it'll be the number one thing i do next year all of next

download i mean i don't own heaven right and if i have things he's given me to share some of them are available for people that they can just have some of those images but but i am calling to reveal heaven to earth and it's a commission in person by jesus christ he didn't just say it to me he came in person wow and so uh and and i've seen him many times since then and the father many times even holy spirit and so if i'm i'm here to reveal heaven to earth the first thing i had to know was really know them and my heart was already seeking them i didn't once they decide wake up well i think i need to know god when i was little my mom always said i was so strange she didn't know what god would do with me and now we know what he's doing with me yeah wow well kat that's awesome and we want to

hey welcome to the broadcast and happy wednesday january 19 2022 it's nice to be back sorry i've been gone since i think the last time you saw me was a week ago today when i did the broadcast with kat i we had quite a lot of stuff happening i was i was supposed to be heading out to the clay clark event and uh i got taken out by one mega back injury and so i didn't wasn't able to go and then no sooner did we return home from the airport with you know we were headed toward the airport we had to turn around and come back then drain got sick with what we think is probably the latest variant uh that's going around in about two days after that i got it so right now even as we speak both three and i got up this morning and even though we're doing a lot better we're still feeling that nausea that in fact for me it's the first time it just showed up same thing that happened to her so ah this thing holds on but anyways uh thank you all for honoring kelsey o'malley she did a great great job and i'm very much appreciated appreciative of her for to stepping in for me but it's nice to be back it's nice totally nice to be back because you know i like to be involved and i don't like to just sit around but man you want to sleep you want to just ah anyway appreciate the prayers thank you so much um for all of you who did pray for me you know even on the back injury that i had i don't think we publicized this because sometimes it's better not to you know i had a mentor you all know who bobby connor is and he used to teach never let the enemies see you sweat um and basically the whole thing was don't make a big deal to the enemy how injured you are because then he knows he's one so so you try not to complain and you don't say oh poor me you know and uh so that kind of translates well this way too because if he told if we told everybody oh i'm i'm laying flat on my back with this big old injury then everyone's worried about you so it's almost better to just find out we have a prayer team that are always keeping us covered so we do cover those things in prayer very very seriously when they happen but we don't always make it a general announcement so all right well thank you for being our loyal viewers and being coming back so let's see what do we want to do i want to remind you that now we've started this year and last few days of last year on elijah list.com when you

click the thumbs up means you like us the red subscribe means you subscribe and the bell means your devices will be notified you only want to click on it while it's red otherwise you unsubscribe so i think that's about it so without further ado let's bring cat curry here it's about time we got back together kat yes i i you know what i missed being with you miss talking with you but your team does a great job just so you know that it was really great it was really powerful but i was praying i didn't know exactly what it was but i was definitely declaring over you and praying over you which i actually do every day you and doreen wow thank you something if i feel impressed to pray something stronger than i do and um just because i'd like to take advantage of any chance to train people when you begin to have any kind of strains whether it's your back your leg or severe cramps you can you can learn or train yourself to release the peace of god into that situation and it literally will stop that it will stop it god told me one time i had actually pulled a muscle or something and i kept asking him do something he said i'm not going to do he said you're going to do it and he said you need to learn to release what you already carry which is the anointing which we all carry according to first john 2 27 go look it up and the anointing brings like a peace with it and literally you would lay on your hand on yourself like i release i impart the peace of god and uh and it might work not work the first few times but eventually you will do that and the cramp or the pain will go wow it has to do with muscles and tendons or even your bones and i i have to do that all the time if i overdo it or for whatever reason you know i what if for whatever reason if i have any pinched anything or strained anything that is the number one way i get rid of it with the anointing wow and you know what kat you told us all a couple months ago you talked about people that weren't sleeping well which has happened to me a lot in my life in the last few years and you talked about i command the rest of god i think is the way i understand it and during i've been practicing that the first time i thought it didn't really get where i wanted it to go but when i remember to do it which i usually do if i'm having trouble yeah and there'll be a little bit of a delay the next thing i know i wake up in the morning i mean it's like it was really really powerful so if you have insomnia anyone watching this and what you what i would say i had to do is i had to engage my faith which means i had to believe that what i was saying was gonna work or it was just words right yeah kind of have to put some faith in it so it wasn't just words and then i when i when i believe that what i say is gonna happen i command the rest of god i have a great night's sleep cat that was that's a phenomenal teaching it is and actually it's um it's he showed me one time i was in the mountains of north carolina he showed me one time how we create now i'm not talking about when i say create people automatically think well you know create like people and things like that no you know you create stuff like you come up with ideas to create things whether it's a cake i'm always going to say use cake for you know don't forget to celebrate and eat cake i'm still doing it but smaller pieces by the way but when you begin to create even in heaven you learn to do this so you can get a jump start down here on the earth and god says the earth and your time on earth is actually boot camp for eternity and the greater your faith gets the more you can get things done but when i said your faith and god said you mean your soul your soul has to be engaged with everything you believe or you speak about which is why sometimes you don't get good things if you're saying nothing but negative about yourself guess what you're going to think you're going to think negative and it will be hard to push through that so number one stop saying you can't or you won't or you don't have you have to stop saying those words because of course god created with words but he taught me he said what you say from your mouth has to line up with what is in your soul when your soul engages with what you're saying and you know that is still it is still of course your faith your faith comes from there your your soul is your mind what you think on your will what you decide to do in your emotions is what you say or how you say it so he said in order to create things like wholeness in your body still using the blood of jesus of course we wouldn't have any of this and i want to go back to the beginning of him on the cross we would have nothing if we didn't have him when we create when we command it's because of what he did for us because of what he gave us the ability and the right to do but even in doing this like the believing trusting and then you step into faith but it's all created in your soul which is why it's important god said he said to to guard it to guard what that is don't let the world let man's opinions or thoughts of you come in at you you say what you say is what you will become and we know the word says that so when you begin to engage with like i'm having creams in my leg and i want this to stop and i have the right to tell it to stop i do because we were made uh perfect in every way we're new creations through jesus christ we speak to things and they happen that was his whole point of doing it when he was on the earth but your soul engages in this whole faith thing if you think on it and you meditate on it that's still your mind that's still coming from your soul we were always taught the soul was not a good thing but that was wrong a dark soul maybe but not one filled with the light of god and the love of god so when you begin like the rest of the lord will use that uh when you begin it is still a process like you're being trained for anything whether it's to be an athletic or trained for business or trained even as a baker it's a process and the more you do it the better you get it the better results you have it is the same thing when you're declaring and believing for something when you finally believe one day and you say i command and that's the proper word i command the rest of the lord you're not telling god what to do you're doing what he said he said command you me he was saying you say what you want done so this all ties back to the word of god this is outside the word this is living the word of god and you say i command the rest of the lord to come upon me and you've been believing for sleep praying for sleep you begin to say i want the rest of the lord i need the rest of the lord the rest of the lord you come one day you say that and you'll be knocked out by god i mean you will sleep so good all night long and every night after that you will be able to do that you know and then i just said son i'm just telling you the people that that's a real thing and you know it's one thing if you hear this teacher or that teacher say that you know we we have lots and lots of teachers and sometimes it's easy to you know i don't know if they know for sure i don't know if this is just a theory of theirs but when kat who's been with the father thousands of times yes if she says this is what you're supposed to do i take it a little more seriously maybe i should maybe i should have taken well not that i've heard this particular teaching before but you know cat it works and you know i've spent when i i laid bedridden people don't know this a lot of people don't know this but from about oh let's see from 12 especially from about 2010 to 2012 29 i was bedridden and i couldn't sleep i laid there night after night i was so deprived of sleep if i had known this yeah it would have been different oh man that would have been so great but you know god this is why in this time people go well why not before this is a special time i don't look at the things going on around me i don't ignore them i'm innocent of evil i'm innocent of darkness you know i'm filled with the light of god and hope and power i mean hope was wonderful but power and operating in is where god wants us to be that's we're supposed to be dangerous against hell you're supposed to be filled with the light and love of god always have an answer for people of truth yes but of the power of god and living in the life of god that's what a manifested son and daughter is it's not some special people who'll send down to heaven all of a sudden they'll be here on the earth it's us it's us it's the body of christ learning to operate in the fullness of what he always intended and that's why the father normally teaches me himself this is what you do and say and hello people if anybody knows that would be a father son or holy spirit and i've been trained by all three of them why so you can be trained and be empowered it's it's excited to be you know you're inspired inspiring is nice empowering is better okay you live above and never beneath how can we rule if jesus said you will rule with me in this life and in the life to come uh your ruling is totally different than you know i'm begging and it's okay to ask when you don't know but but when you begin to declare and decree and you begin to say i'm not tolerating sickness i'm not having sickness and the word actually says when you bless your food you mean you must say take sickness far from me and did you even know that was worse so every time you said your blessing thank you for the food but then add and take sickness far from me wow wow it won't have a chance to even come to you but again it's a process it's something i add all the time in my prayer when i a blessing for your food you can add so many things in that uh i thank you for this food blessed to my body and i ask for and receive your wisdom your revelation your understanding you keep adding because whatsoever you say is what you will have right whatever within you or you allow in you is what you will become that is up to you okay jesus christ did his part by dying but this was a walk in his footsteps he was never afraid okay he was never afraid of anything he wasn't killed honestly he laid down his life he rose from the dead he's the king of everything everywhere and he wants you to be like him so the enemies the world the darkness is crushed and pushed back that's how things will really begin to change and that's why he's having me teach spirit force which i know that's where this button is this is and i'll be very soon um next month month of march i'll actually start teaching that uh in mass to people really really good now i want to ask you you mentioned something i want to drill down on this for a second uh when we've been hearing teaching through the years and the decades we've talked about someday the manifested sons of daughters of god and and we'd hear this or that statement but you said something a minute ago and i'm just gonna run this by you have you repeat or clarify is it possible that two believers uh side by side are walking out their life and one of them is just like a carnal christian and the other person's manifested sons and daughters of god because they're because they're walking it out can can two believers one being manifested one not yes because manifesting well that doesn't mean you're not a believer right you get born again this is the beginning of everything you choose you choose how much of god you want your life how much time you give him and if you are applying just the written word of god but it says man shall not live by bread alone but by every word spoken from the mouth of god and of course everything he says is based on his word his written word and i tell you right now i don't like it when people leave parts of the bible out when they decide they're going to translate it some other way or something you can't delete parts of the bible and i don't like it when some people decide well i don't think i understand that i'm going to change this i would be very careful if you if you get a bible that leaves whole things out that god said would happen i don't know that was free free commercial from the holy spirit right here but i can tell you yes uh even in the husband and wife or whatever sister brother whatever you choose how much of god you're gonna run after and let me tell you what a manifested son or daughter of god this is how the father says it to manifest means to show and prove who and what you believe by what you say the choices you make and the power of god you operate in wow so i let me say this even one other way i could be having a conversation um making this up of course with my let's say with my wife and i'm gonna say you know i was at the park and i got i got into a conversation with this nice family member and you know what the wife it's like she's one of the manifested sons of god and i could say that and people go what what are you talking about and and and the answer would be because she is manifesting everything that we've ever been taught about what a manifested sense of the god sons of god yeah using the word sons yeah sons and daughters of god so that's am i saying that right someone can just be a manifested and someone next to them might not be that is true because that person was running after god listening to us you're applying what you're hearing when you go to church and sit in a pew you know you're not just there to hear something you're here to learn something you're being trained okay i told you this is all boot camp and you become uh you the more of god you let in you and you hunger after the more like him you will begin to operate uh in the word of god when god said let us make man in our image that's father son and holy spirit and after our likeness that's how they operate so literally he made us not to be him he's not saying to him but he wants us to operate in authority and dominion over the darkness over the evil and if you're over here playing around or complaining like you know all you have is a bad report and i'm not talking about what you just said steve but you know there are some people that have not got one positive thing in their mouth to say and if you you're very positive and powerful and you help people become great in god by believing he really is hearing testimonies of overcoming in the power of god they begin to think differently but if you're always only around people who speak doom and gloom negative you know and they say things like well this is never going to change i can't stand this there's so much evil everywhere well what are you talking about are you talking more about the evil or more about the power of god to demonstrate and manifest is to let people know he is alive you walk in that authority yourself people know you have authority by the way you're talking and you demonstrate that by believing it and saying it then you even show people how to operate like that i would definitely say that would be an operated son or daughter of god and it says the earth is crying out in the word for the manifested sons and daughters of god to stand up okay the earth itself knows that things aren't going right they know the evil is trying to invade they want us we are his sons and daughters that's what god calls us right he is our father we're sons and daughters but that doesn't mean every son or daughter manifest and demonstrate who he is by the way you live your life it is a lifestyle what i live is not just something i say here it is my life it's how i live and i don't change any day and you can tell i had someone call last night and say you know that their child their child was like screaming uh that their brain was hurting and to pray for them and i know this person said he called me that and this is the first thing i can tell you this might as well teach you right now is trying to attack you as a believer they have no right but i'm telling you if you've learned about the devil he does whatever and get away with and i was taught this by another prophet um uh this couple they they did a lot of discernment and deliverance and stuff uh and they taught me that if you start getting sharp pains in your head that is a sign that witchcraft is trying to affect you and i told them after several things i went you need to take your hand over your child's head and say i sever all witchcraft trying to attack my daughter and when they did that because they had they did have a fever it wasn't ohio and instantly there was a change wow and see they don't think you know how to do that this is one of the things you're going to learn in um spirit um spirit spirit force by the way is the way you live and operate that the enemy will run from you and actually says satan will flee from you if you put yourself under the hand of god and resist him resist him isn't just saying oh don't call me here it's like i'm coming after you i'm living the way god said i know who i am who he is and i'm not tolerating you attacking me your life will begin to change but like witchcraft will try to sneak in it tries to control whatever it can get away with but i have learned that and every now and then i feel like there's a spear poking me in my head but i know what that is and i'll just say several witchcraft right now in jesus name and it leaves instantly when they did that they were shocked that instantly there began to be a change in their child and when they woke up this morning all the pain was gone it was all that's so good so it's what we know see that's why he doesn't want us to be clueless his word is is a basic foundation for us to operate from but when you begin to hear directly through holy spirit he will train you how to be powerful the father it'll never go against what he said in his word that you can't live in darkness and play in the enemy's camp and think you'll have authority how can you have authority over somebody you're partnering partnering with right you can't you can't run out here and willingly sin all the time and think you can tell them they're not coming near you or attacking you it's a lie from hell you either live for god or you don't live for him and god said i'd rather have you hot or cold and if you lukewarm i can't do much of anything with you that's what that scripture says that the scriptures i'll i'll spill you out of my mouth that does not mean he won't love you you won't get heaven that means he can't give you authority to do things if you're going to play in the middle okay you can't play in the gray area you're in the light or the dark and i want to add this because i always like to give you the more the reason why god wants you hot or cold cold you're just not doing nothing for living over here in the world he said all i have to do is get that person saved and they're hot they're already actively working in the darkness but if you're already on fire for god and you're operating powerfully you right where he wants you but if you're cold you know really still cold doing nothing don't even know him he said that person who already is doing something even though it's not right when i get them saved they will be hot but the lukewarm they don't want to make commitments they don't want to try to find out more they're not hungry for him they're just hanging on till they die and go to heaven one day and i i can tell you you will be so grateful that you operated and manifested the power of the living god and what we're about to see in this earth will shock people coming from believers who run after god not step back not jumped off the path especially in this time you will be accelerated and you will be operating powerfully for him with him and because of him jesus christ in this world that's good well kel we have a lot of questions before we get into them questions about heaven and related is there anything else you want to add are you ready for the questions oh i'm ready for the question all right so here's the first question and i guess i missed this a couple times illumination said i missed this so here we go uh merrill lynn interesting spelling m-a-r-o-l-y-n-n-e what an what a neat way to spell maryland marilyn asked i was born with as an idiot twin uh but yet we look nothing alike as many do look like god doesn't have even two snowflakes the same will twins look alike in heaven there's two questions well twins look alike in heaven and the second question is is there any reason why god would give uh two births at the same time i guess i guess they're asking why are there twins why did he do twins okay so first one is what is uh will they look alike in heaven i'm sure it says in the bible we'll go back to the bible it says you will be known as you were known that means people will recognize you like they recognize you on the earth you'll look a whole lot better i mean the light of god's coming out of you you've got joy on you you're excited all the time um so there could be twins and maybe one was happy one wasn't maybe it was gonna be maybe it was whatever but he made you for a purpose and yes he did make twins for a purpose many times twins have a very strong connection and if you learn how to operate with god with that strong connection it's it's really it's almost like a two-fold chord uh when you when you come together as a twin and you have this connection that's really different from other siblings um it's because god made you that way on purpose and yes you will still look like you in heaven i see people who look alike in heaven that they were twins on the earth uh you don't lose that and so but you say you have different personalities or different likes like i like chocolate i like vanilla whatever stuff like that or i want to go to the valley of the falls and you know i want to go to passionate paradise or or i want to go to the surf park and everybody has their things they like but twins and a lot of times do a lot of things together and they have especially a special bond and god did send people as twins on purpose to the earth to have that special bonding connection because when he gets involved it's very powerful well when they pray when they declare uh together as twins and lots of times they'll know what's going on with the other even if they're not together at all so yeah and if they're triplets it's even more powerful wow yeah wow okay that's interesting all right simone asks uh when we're singing and worshiping or praying do our angels do that with us do they or do they worship uh with us is the actual question do our angels worship with us when we're worshiping i think most of the time they're watching up for your back they know you're worshiping and they get really excited i can tell you that your angels get so excited when you anytime you worship god if you're helping another person they get really joyous they get really joyous when you're reading the word of god anytime something you're doing that that connects you to god but worship is very powerful in heaven if you could see worship in the spirit realm it's like it does many things at one time when you worship god from your heart you're so dangerous against how missiles like missiles come from you and shoot up into the second heaven and they bust things up in the second heaven because all worship goes to god from this earth to him that's where it goes actually goes to these golden bowls before the altar sometimes they come directly into him and then he'll take it and he'll himself put it in the gold i'm talking about the father he'll put your praises like incense and they'll put in these golden bowls and when they're full he tips them and the move of god comes to the earth but you're also crushing plans of the enemy when you worship it is very powerful and it makes jesus really really happy because you're connecting saying you're hungry for him any songs that adore him are the most popular ones in heaven if it adores him and who christ is and speaks about his divinity or or what he has done for us here on the earth they love it your angels love it when you sing or worship him so it's very powerful i see them in the meetings worship i'll see them worshiping their worship a lot more wild than we do though many times they're dancing they're spinning um they'll walk in and out of you all the time that you're worshiping your own angels well the whole ceiling fills in the sanctuary or wherever you're having these meetings if it's outside if you could see the seer the whole sky would light up with the glory of god from the worship coming from you sends light into the darkness yeah did you just say your angels walk in and out of you did did i hear you right okay you explained that what do you mean because that's and and do they they do that now not just in heaven but they do that now they walk what's what's going on when they do that what happened they're a spiritual being that's why they can walk through the walls this physical world is the second realm the original realm was a spiritual realm where all of things of god that's where they live before he made a canvas and put all the stars and the planets on it it was only a spiritual world but it was a literal world well because they're protecting and guarding us oh they step in and out sometimes i see you sit actually inside your angels sometimes or you stand inside your angels they're always right there by you uh uh and around you no matter where you go sometimes you walk through them and you don't even know you're doing that because it's they're they're spiritual beings is it a protection thing uh because i've never really explored this with you when they walk in you i get that they're spirit beings and they can walk through walls and see men in anything but when they're walking through you what's being is something must be being accomplished or they wouldn't bother right so they're making deposits god will send to bother that you know it says your angel memory he says in the bible that your your angel's face is always before the father remember that it says in the bible oh yeah you always have more than one you always have more than one because one is always always with you and so they'll take turns going before the father sometimes they're saying things or whatever he's calling them up there and i've seen them doing many things especially during a meeting where they have mass miracles they bring they're the ones who bring the body parts down from heaven your angel usually will get your body part if you're lacking or need something replaced or if you've asked for uh like help me with kindness i want more kindness they'll the father will send a deposit of kindness and they'll walk through you and then part it into you they'll literally hold it and walk through you and put it inside of you in your spirit the uh i'm thinking of a specific relative of mine i won't name it um and they're walking away from the lord and there's a whole bunch of new age stuff going on and there's pictures on the wall where they're doing this and they're doing all these and they're walking that's what they're doing so what are their angels have their do their angels leave them because they're in this state do their angels double up because they need more help what what goes on it depends on who's praying for those people usually now if god has assigned them to you your your guardian angel comes while you're in the womb it's waiting for you to be born so they're with you before you get involved in anything you have any understanding of anything they're with you from the time you're little and if you see babies smile which i was holding one the other night um they were looking at my angel they couldn't take their eyes off of my angel because i could see my angel and my angels behind me or it comes around me and they would look at the angel continually i could see their angels all the time they were right there with that around that baby they were somewhere in the room they had like five different angels with them so they're a prophet they will be a prophet they're not gonna become one they are one and so they have more depending on the assignment that god gives you you have more angels if in a different season in your life maybe you normally have three he could send five or ten more depending on where you're going to be going for him or doing for him so that changes but you always have the ones he originally sent waiting outside i see pregnant women all the time with angels following them around that is that babies angels so they're with you from that time and a lot of babies begin to smile they go with looking at nothing and smiling no they're looking at their own angels and so uh the the angelic have a very powerful assignment from god and it does say he sends them to keep you and protect you in all your ways so most of the time it is sort of like a protection thing that they're assigned to you and sometimes they've said whisper things in your ear like make sure you stop don't go if the lights change don't go yet many times at your own angel saying that to you and of course the more of god you have in you and uh people go i don't even know what that means well do you meditate about him do you talk to him like he's actually there people how do i build a relationship you act like he's really there and you talk to him just like as if you could see him just tell him you know i love you i'm so grateful to you for what you've done i'm so excited about the things that are about to take place in the earth no matter what the news or anyone else is saying you're believing what god's timing is and the more you do that the clearer you hear holy spirit father of jesus christ and i do know this the more that you step out begin to believe what his word says and then you live like you believe it your spiritual ears will begin to be open so my question on on this cat is there are so you and i know tons of people or stories about the same that people who are called a high calling in their life and something happened and they began to just walk away and they began to experiment and they'll one day they'll tell their story they say i just was running away from god as fast as i could go they'll say that so when they're running away and then in fact when they're what they usually mean is i did this and i'm doing this and i started doing that what what are their angels oh they don't leave okay they do not leave they're right there beside you the whole time and sometimes the choices you make yourself as a person may get yourself in a lot of trouble or maybe you begin to reject the words of god i'm not saying you abandon necessarily being a christian it's like you're going more to another another way like leaning on your own understanding not what you learn from the word and maybe you make decisions where you yourself can get hurt or whatever they double up what they're doing for you i mean they don't leave you they still try to influence you a lot of times they're shaking their head i mean uh even they don't sometimes they really do i see them roll their eyes sometimes i think they're saying the angels they have they have personalities they're not robots some will just begin to pray really hard for you the other ones are like rolling their eyes at you like come on come on you need to you need to understand you shouldn't be doing that you shouldn't be going into that place they will try to influence you if you go into places that are really not good they'll actually cover their eyes wow and they'll cover their eyes but they won't leave you when did you say because we're talk about that our angels do this they protect here they stand and you know they block this but did you say your angels pray for you do angels pray so our angels pray like we pray they've got a prayer life as well is that what you're saying life it's a little bit different from ours because they know the things the father can do they know the things jesus christ died for they'll begin to repeat what the word has said and they will be declaring the word over those people that they have been assigned to they don't just do it for anybody but the ones that they were assigned to from the time you know before they were born they were sent to take them when you die your guardian angel is the one who escorts you to heaven whether you're picked up in a chariot or where you're picked up but some other way there's many ways you can be transported to heaven your own guardian angel when you step out of this physical body and your spirit man steps out the first thing you'll see will be your own angel good well well all right well um this is a good question um this is renee's asking i i he says i see or he i can't tell i take care of my 98 year old mother who has dementia who has dementia how can i lead her to the lord i've tried to be simple but she says quote what are you talking about close quote yeah when some people not everybody i'd say that very carefully my mom is 90 she's sharp as attack people and so um it's just some people aren't some aren't um what you do in that situation or i can add something even more to that if they're in the hospital and they're not responding you can speak to their spirit man and i tell people there actually have been people came back and get tested and said even though i wasn't responding my body wasn't responding i heard every word you said their spirit may inherit it i tell people don't ever stop believing for their salvation don't ever stop doing that and you can just say very politely make sure you know jesus christ can can i help you pray to him if they were born again and got born again at a young age it's like god keeps this i don't want to say he has a hook in you but it makes him you have a tie to him you know it says that jesus is married to the backslider right doesn't it say that so even though you get off an area you shouldn't be he doesn't leave you he always has hope that you will recognize him and go back to what you believed in the beginning and so that's why your angels will still pray and declare you know to these people but as far as a senior uh sometimes the closer they get to 100 somewhere over 100 is still sharp it depends on every single person is different their soul processes things differently some days are clearer than other days so don't give up you know speaking of being very gentle when you speak to them whether and they're already of the age while they're sleeping is a good time to speak to them that's good does not ever sleep and i i tell people still speak to them still leave them in a prayer of salvation if they're really while they're asleep please do that wow you're serious you can lead a person yes and their spirit man can respond it will totally respond and we ourselves have heard i've lived in church my entire life okay we were almost born on a pew i tell people that's where we were every service it was a six week six week revival we were there every single meeting uh that's where we lived it was like our second home and so we heard a lot of testimonies sometimes people miss but we heard testimonies of people who were in comas in the hospital and they're and they weren't born again and they their loved one would visit them all the time they would put their hand on them they would pray over them they themselves would say now i believe that you can hear me even though your flesh can't respond i'm going to lead you in this prayer and they would lead them in the sinner's prayer like at least once when they were coming to visit them and now they they didn't die and go to heaven these people lived they came back and they said i heard you every time you led me in that prayer i had to say it now this was their spirit man even though their flesh was then speaking this was the actual person who came back woke up out of the coma and said i heard you say that every time he spoke to me and they said thank you for not giving up giving up on me but while i was out my spirit man heard you and i received christ wow you know there's no teaching about this i mean this is wonderful news because i didn't know you could lead someone to the lord when they're in a coma or when they're when they're asleep that's phenomenal cat i mean your soul you know your three parts right body soul and spirit your soul never sleeps your soul doesn't need to sleep it's a spiritual thing your spirit man never sleeps it's always awake and i encourage people play some really powerful amazing music in the room especially if people are not feeling well the best thing you can do unless you if you're given a medicine they've told you to give them medicine this is before the whole virus thing i'm not talking about that at all i'm not in my opinions of that right now but normally just not feeling well or maybe the under doctor's care the best thing you can do for that person is to play the word of god or being spoken or to play music that brings the presence of god your spirit man and your soul will get very strong because of that but i always have encouraged people since being young don't give up on your family member and please if you if you're standing for their salvation you'll find out later in heaven when you see them there what your words spoke and made a difference in their life so it's important but again you can't you can't sell the bad wicked evil things you're saying if you're over here standing right you're being double minded yeah you're staying in that gap you stay there you declare over them i'm not saying you have to pray pray 24 hours a day back in the day you know i'm coming from like born in the 50s people so i've seen just about every move of god since the 50s there has been and was a part of a lot of them and i'm like i was surprised at what people didn't understand god could do and and would he actually do it and i'm like do you not believe there is a god i mean i think number one you really have to believe when you receive christ it's he steps inside of you he's there he's actually with you all the time not just your angels and so i encourage people he's there he's never going to leave yet says so why not talk to him like i'm talking to you like i can't see you but i feel like i'm talking to thousands of people right now when i speak and i'm serious like steve said i'm serious everything god taught me i had to live it that's how i know these things work but when when a mass of the body begins to believe and live like he really is and declare it and begin to speak to things around you you'll be shocked how different your life is you'll come home walk into the presence of god because you've invited a habitation of heaven by what you're saying in your home where no one's watching or looking what are you watching what are you letting in your home what are you letting come in from the tv from the computer um it says in the bible we'll be we will be held account for every word you know that we speak i'm not saying if you're a believer you won't go to heaven but don't use wasteful things i don't spend your time repeating what they're advertising about hell going on in the earth right now are you talking more about god and his plans and his power are you talking more about the power of the enemy and that's how fear gets into people if all you're talking about is how afraid you are and how wicked and bad and evil everything is out there people don't even think about god if i talk about the life of god and his power and his plans that he has for this earth he made it he held it in his hands and made this earth he's not ignoring anything he knows what's going on in justice i just have to say holy spirit saying yes justice has already been released from heaven it's waiting to act so why not tell your children ask your children what is god saying to you can you hear his voice he wants to speak to you do you know god wants you to be great for him that the invention creativity that will happen in your lifetime will be phenomenal this little baby i was holding all i said was powerful exciting things a little baby like a month old and that baby began to grin and almost laugh at the words i was giving was life to them okay it was life to this little tiny baby who who didn't really know anything except that was somebody speaking light and life to him and he didn't really know me but it didn't matter i was giving him what god was saying about him and it was changing the way he responded in seconds so what are you feeding your family with your words are you giving them life are you empowering them inspiring them to be something great for god regardless of what's going on in this world this world does not own you okay you're in the hand of god if you belong to him expect him expectancy with god is just as powerful as reading the word and praying expectancy i say i ask for and receive expectancy the expectancy and the excitement god that you carry i ask for that and i bind that to my soul and it's one of the reasons why i say excited but if all you're saying is did you hear what they said here did you hear that now this is what happened and don't say no this is going to happen say i'm i'm not tolerating any of this stuff being forced i decide what god wants for me i'm living in my life's going in in that direction the only new normal for me will be god invading my place that's good that's good to wrap up then let me i want to really clarify this 98 year old mother who has dementia which means she just she's not there she may or may not be there at all she's yeah or if she remembers something it's for 30 seconds i know my mom's headed that way so if whether it's a 98 year old mother who has dementia like this question or a 10 year old or 20 year old who has me who is so mentally challenged that they they do not relate to language as you and i know it okay so they so as far as we know their brain doesn't work even in that case you while they're asleep you can lead them to the lord right i will say this because i have to add anyone who is um of an older age or even like you said 20 if they're mentally challenged if their physical brain doesn't operate like ours god treats them like a little child and and let me tell you even at the time of their death he will present himself to them he will lead them to him himself he is not an unjust god and if that was if that's how they were born or something happened to them and mentally they can't process or they can't think he does not hold that against them but they are treated by god as a child as a young child and he's not going to send them to hell he will make sure they have an opportunity to know him in the bible it says i make myself known to every man that means every human being so that part i can tell you the mentally challenged like that god knows that they're like a child but i would totally still speak to them and say jesus loves you if that's all you can get into them it's going to go in their spirit it will begin to actually affect them if you put words of life in them god loves you he sent you here uh to be with us you know we love you god uh has plans for you one day you'll get to see him in person those are words of hope well anytime hope uh the hope brings glory to god which is in the word of god christ in you is the hope of glory that you saying words of hope to people that draws the glory of god and that can even bring healing it can begin to change physically the way their brain operates and and they've even tested that on plants just relating a plant who has no real life a plant you speak kind words to and encourage this plant i love that you're growing how beautiful you are wow really they have proved scientifically some plants that they're bashed and falsely accused they did this is a real i had many trials done in science labs that plant died but the one that had words of hope and power and those released that plant flourished these are living things not with the soul but the living in their words affected the plants how do you think they're going to be in to affect the soul of a person no matter what kind of situation their physical man is in their spirit man is made perfect their spirit man is made perfect and your spirit sometimes leaps for joy even if your physical man doesn't understand it so i have to say these people who say you know it's important what you say be kind to people even some of them if they don't have an understanding of god they have learned their self kindness and hope begin to change people even people who aren't nice even people with all their mental faculties it matters what you say to people and and i always try to find someone some every day to be kind to or to help or to give them hope and i don't know these people and they don't even know who i am but when you release words of hope it like pierces the darkness in a person and light begins to come from the words you speak words look like little missiles of light going into a person's spirit and will begin to affect their natural man that's good that's good now you we had talked to they someone wrote here that was episode 57 where you said there will become cities of light that will start to happen and the person's asking in reference to that is this something that we can look forward to in our live lifetime and how soon if there's any concept you have as far as when will this happen or how soon can we look forward to cities of light i absolutely expect that to happen probably in most people's lifetime um because i have to say god has talked about a divine decade a double decade which would be like 2000 i think that was like 2000 2010 2000 2010 2020 2020 like to 2040 so many major changes are going to come and i have been telling people watch for the first three months of this year for things to be seen and heard you haven't seen or heard wow i'm i'm not saying the whole the whole flip they call it flip whatever you can call it it's actually a turning more than is like a flip thing but when you begin to see that the hand god turning his hand literally what you will begin to see in these next few months is so much darkness will come to light there's a lot of darkness out there a lot of it's still hidden people are getting away with things but in these first three months you will see major people exposed and never thought they would be exposed and and that is very key to what he is doing in the earth now but i fully expect regions of regions of light to exist on the earth because i was taken into the regions of light and i do happen to know this city i live in will become a region of light he showed me at one point demons leaving the city like dust they were leaving like dust because the glory of god was beginning to be embedded here and coming from the people who live here begin to operate and what he has called them to operate in and i know there's a lot of people coming to florida what they don't understand and i'm laughing at certain people who just bought property here from the left they're stepping into the greatest battle station on earth god said florida was the battle station of the host on earth so they're stepping into a very dangerous place yeah yeah there's some people that'll probably lose that property that they're and other people other people that will that will join join the kingdom you know so let's see um this is just let me add one more thing go ahead yes please when he showed me this about this city um we were sent here back in 61 though we have no intention of leaving by the way there's 150 of us people um and some of them are rednecks i don't think i'm a redneck but i tell you what i am a manifested daughter of god and i already know that if you don't like it why don't you start living it okay i'm not against you being that it's what you choose but he caught me up into space over the earth by the way it was round there you go again the holy spirit always does that i love it there's no flat earth he never made a flat earth heaven is not flat earth is a shadow of heaven god's home is a world a whole world bigger than our probably of everything that you can see out there but he caught me up and he had put a grid around the earth like a grid you know people know what a great is up above the earth and there were states were lighting up he began to light up these states that i saw and he said these will all be regions of light and there were more regions of light than of darkness really oh yeah more regions of light because the body will begin to get and understand who they are begin to operate in the fullness of what christ gave them and the more they see it happen the more they'll get so inspired and excited and then they become empowered because of running after jesus christ i think there also will be many sightings of christ now in saying all that the enemy will be out there trying to demonstrate he is somebody and he has something which at one point a lot of people will laugh at because there's so much of god around that's how different it's going to be i saw regions of light i told people already las vegas will be a region of las vegas and reno will both be a region of light i saw california as a region of light people so no matter what's going on there now they better change or they won't want to stay because you know what the devil doesn't want to stay where a lot of god is he just doesn't want to and it what will happen is so many people will begin to run to god and demonstrate and the miraculous that will be happening the new inventions and stuff this is what's coming this is going to be your new norm so why not prepare your children that greatness is coming they're going to be a part of this don't don't ever let fear be put in your children by lies that are being told everywhere you will see some of the best the greatest justice you've ever seen on the earth but on the other side of that the greatest celebration the greatest invention and uh people being inspired people caring about each other some churches will not make a denomination anymore they're just going to belong to jesus christ not that there won't be some organizations out there uh i'm just saying life will be so different that people will want to know christians that is how different it will be from now they won't be listening to the left it will start to slipped it out they won't be listening to things that are the darkness or doom and gloom or the takeover theory that isn't what's going to happen okay the only theory that's going to happen is jesus christ the plans of jesus christ the timeline of god and that's why he shows me things so i can empower you by these words and if you're from the other side you don't like me it's too late people you're filled with the anointing you can't get rid of it that's really good by the way that's a really good word about california because i was raised in california and i've been thinking man maybe i need to because i just thought one day when i buy my uh vacation home okay that's not now but one day um i'd like it to be in california but i thought maybe i better change that maybe that needs to be in florida where there's actual freedom but you're saying kevin he never played both places steve it's okay okay that sounds good you know what i need is one of those portal doors that i can walk through so hey by the way speaking of portal doors you said in heaven there's doors that you walk through and then suddenly you're in another place cat is there a time in the future where where there's a reality on earth or are there seers that kind of do that now on earth where they walk through a place and suddenly they're in singapore or suddenly they're in you know whatever timbuktu have you heard about that kind of thing i have heard about it actually it's been several years since i heard the people now and there's a lot into saying that whole thing and i always take time to explain i'm not saying every single person would be able to do that that's not what i'm saying and and i'm saying some of them didn't even know how it happened i know how that happens in the spirit but i'm not saying every person who god just inspires you and he'll say step in there and they'll open the door and step in and they won't be in that same room they'll be somewhere else sometimes it'll be just that simple i do know there are people that understand about going in and out of the spirit realm but you have to be very careful i'm not saying that out of fear i'm saying that out of wisdom and let the holy spirit guide you and all that there's some people who think well we can all do this and then they get they forget who jesus christ is they forget he's a part of this and now they have to say it will happen more and more but yes it does that's how people travel in heaven a lot of them will step into a door or into beams of light and they will take them to a whole different place in heaven there absolutely is going to be new ways to travel like trains will run on beams of light not on rails on the ground that is absolutely going to happen on this that's here on earth and you're saying that's here here on earth that will happen here they'll have ways to like hold highways that will be from um i don't understand because you know i had a 12th grade education decided to disappoint you people uh i've i've graduated from the college in heaven but but not on the earth okay and it's okay to pursue a higher education just don't let that place tell you there is no god just very where you go but i can tell you yes i was shown things that would literally be created on the earth and i do know this and will still say five major diseases including cancer will no longer exist on this earth and that will not be very far down the road it may not i'm not saying it'd be 10 20 years down the road at all i think those are going to happen probably within the next several years maybe between five and ten years these five major diseases won't be on the earth that alone will change people's lives new ways to transport that won't cost a lot of money energy comes down from up in space captured and brought to this earth will not be very far down the road that that happens and it may not be in somebody's lifetime but i was shown i saw a lot of buildings and things that remained the same i saw a lot of things that were different i've been taking you know five years in the future 15 30 50 100 almost 150 years and guess what the tribulation hadn't happened people stopped trying to ride out on the rapture rug the loading state the greater things you will see happen on the earth if i was somebody well i am somebody i want to be here as long as he has me here because i can make a difference in the lives of people and i already know what's coming and the medical field will change educational field will change the business world will majorly change uh and even the christian world itself would begin to actually act like there is a god people other nations and high level people will seek people out to find out where they got revelation from and and and actually take it and act on it so there's things hidden in the ground like well not just the glory but i'm talking about natural things hidden that we will discover that will help improve our life in this world and this is god's plan for these days he chose you in a powerful time on the earth all the stuff going on around you is about exposing evil it is not about evil taking over you know and cat uh you know who kathy walters is and she was a friend of arthur burt who's gone home to be at the lord bert with a teeth there's a burke with a k we're not talking about that one is arthur burt with the t he's one of them that said 2012 uh was the beginning of the kingdom age he's one of those but before he went and he he tells the story about he was in an airport and and he wanted to use the restroom and god said take your bags with you to the air to the bathroom he goes lord i don't need take your bags with you to the bathroom so he goes into the bathroom with his bags he comes out and he's in another country airplane you know so that that's not technology that per se that's that's an encounter that's a supervision you know josh uh i can't think of he plays the keyboard josh joshua people know who i'm talking about um he's a he's a young youngish man i mean he's probably 40s or something but he's been transported philip the philip the deacon all he was was a deacon and he was transported so that is going to happen more and more isn't it yes it will absolutely happen more and more yes it will and we've heard you and i have heard and as we wrap up here you know i've heard i think man well johnson who said that you know god took him forward in time this is a few years ago to 2022 and and no one was wearing masks you remember that story he said no one was wearing this and he said and he asked someone what and he realized he was he said what year is this and the person said it's 20 22 and he said who's the president and they said donald trump so you know i've been looking forward to that because god took him there you know and kat let me ask you a question about that make this kind of the final one you've said god has taken you and shown you the future when he shows you that there's these different kinds of encounters one is you're with him and then he just shows you the future he takes you there another one is he transports you as he literally transports you which which is it when he when god takes you to show you the future um well most of the time if he starts talking about the future he literally takes me there okay like i'm there like i'm walking on the ground i see all the stuff around me i hear the sights and the aromas i see the activity and when that's happened to you you should never forget that you should never forget that but um he's also taken to me to other places he's taken me backward in time like literally transported me i felt myself moving one time and i was taken back to the tomb of christ after the stone had been rolled away i actually did that and was in the garden that was before i was with you all and elijah listen we visited that same place i saw the same two angels there that were there when i was taken back wow those angels were still there and you know they were because when they came to look and they said why are you looking for the living among the dad remember those angels have said that those are the same angels who were still posted there i saw them there when we went to israel uh just a couple years ago that's amazing by the way i just remembered it's joshua mills is the is the name i was trying to remember uh joshua mills he's a great great person and he sought the encounters he'll describe how he sought the encounters other people like yourself you've said i've never sought the encounters if i remember right but joshua is one of those the reason i kind of appreciate that side is because um well first of all because i've never been transported in time so i'm thinking if i get permission to at least see the encounter maybe i'll do it but anyway he tells a story about walking through walls and starting to walk through walls and it freaked him out he pulled back but yeah we have amazing times ahead of us amazing feelings well i guess that's our time tell uh tell folks how they can get a hold of your website we've got revealingheaven.com on the screen what can people get there yeah revealing heaven.com is my website where my um it's like my uh official site where all my events are it's where our story is we can buy all kinds of products that represent heaven you can get all kinds of messages uh training you how to be like manifested sons and daughters uh things about heaven before lucifer was kicked out i mean all kinds of these uh revelations that he gave me are in that store

messages on it not just one or two if you want to buy them that way but believe it or not there's still a lot of people honestly that don't do things online and i know all the young people say oh

will get them from there so before we bring kat on i just i haven't told her this um but i think she might laugh a little bit when she sees this but you know in 2017 um i followed cat for a long time i'm i'm pinching myself that i'm even that god's put me here to even be doing this i mean it's it's like is this real god but um in 2017 jeff if you want to pull up that picture i went to her first warrior women's conference in florida and uh there's my mom with the dark hair there's me there's cat and my sister and we all went to see you cat and i remember during this conference you said to us something incredible you said every woman that's here there's a hallway in heaven where you're there's a photo of you and your name that you were part of the first warrior women's conference i'll never forget that you said that because when i first started um following you i was i was really hungry for more and more of jesus more and more of truth more and more of the reality of who jesus is and cat you've taught me so much about cleansing my soul and so much about the lord and just really helped deepen my connection with him so thank you um it's just it's so exciting to have you on here so let's bring on kat kerr for today's show did you did you get a little laugh out of that picture no um there are many many many pictures we all had taken together during the event but um i i love the faculty women so powerful and the holy spirit always gives me little tips throughout the day without even asking for them and he said uh by the way i need to add something else besides that well i think jen's at one point is going to be speaking somewhere and she decided she's going to speak um uh like something about the difference between men and women even though she's not married you know she's lived in like a tribe forever she's got seven brothers and uh a lot of it's hilarious and this is about the difference in men and women this whole thing i'm gonna say uh that um that she knows all the inside stuff okay she knows a lot about guys and how they think maybe they should think a lot harder before they do things that type of thing so but god does have a powerful things he does with women and we are different okay we're steadfast you're not going to pull us away from something we're going to be like you know like a lion going after something and uh especially don't touch anybody we know or we love you're in trouble and the holy spirit and i were talking about her discussing those things with people one day and the holy spirit said you know uh the lord had more women following him than men oh yes you know why he'd never get lost he knew where everything was he'd always have food to eat and he'd have people on your side how about that it is true women went with them everywhere they went and uh and that was known so when jesus traveled by foot people he could have gone on the spirit realm but then what was the point nobody would see him right he'd be right there with him but nobody would see him but he when he traveled they would put up camp sometimes if they couldn't find lodging and jesus paid for the lodging no matter where they went because guess what he was not poor that's just for free he became poor that we might be rich he became poor because he left heaven okay he didn't live poor on the earth but by heaven's standards he was but he had had a lot more women with them guess what they never argued they never second guessed i never doubted you know doubting thomas i just had that for free and for whatever but the women the captain is going for him they made the plans when he was going into the next place they made preparations because you remember when when adam was created god well maybe i'll think about this okay now i better send help i better send big help i'll name her woman like wow look at this man it's better than the table this was all from the holy spirit while i was just in the kitchen i was trying so hard not to laugh at him that's why they call him the drama king but it is absolutely true he had his 12 disciples but they had they had a lot of women that traveled with him to make sure they all got fed took care of the preparations and stuff and jesus um said jesus loved having them with him because he always had so many on his side how about that amen so women are powerful tools in god's hands because they were press in you know i think they don't have a problem being intimate or personal with the father with the son of the holy spirit men need you need to break that wall down and you just get in that place too uh that you hear very clearly and in these days things that never been done before we're about to step into them and i need to add this for free the holy spirit said in the bible when it says uh that there is no difference in male and female let's talk about in the spirit realm in dominion in authority in the spirit there is no difference between a male or female that means they all can rule equally in great authority and power no matter whether you're a man or a woman you still have the same level of authority can run after all of it we can all be kings priests and lords in the kingdom which jesus talked about all the time so there you go there's a plug for women i love you so all the warrior women yeah i know there's many people watching that was probably at those uh that conference too screaming i think it's wonder woman but we were on behalf of the lord we were watching we wore we warned in those things i mean we've bored and every one of them was so powerful i think one time uh women were there from 40 countries in one of the events it's like like the second or third one and we all declared over every single country and i know that even in the time right now god won't forget us declaring over those countries so anyway i'm so happy you were there and uh i don't know if you were there at the time that we actually had the photo machine that was set up and uh we took pictures with like everything it was like 700 women that took hours but it was so much fun well that's one thing i i loved about going because you just we could come up and talk to you after and you would take pictures with us and you're just so down to earth i mean you are like you are on here you're just down to earth very genuine loving person such a gentle humble spirit um you're very strong and powerful in the lord while you're ministering but when i come up to meet you you're you've extremely humble and gentle and that really marked me um when i first met you so thank you for saying yes to jesus and thank you for all you give to the body of christ do you have do you have any updates that you want to share with us um oh wow are there updates people yay i i told people at the end of us here to start watching the first three months of this year the first three months there will be so much exposure uh just in the news i mean it's going to be the reality that it's happening and there's some places some news uh feeds aren't even hiding what's going on but several countries okay not talking about america at this moment but several countries have dumped including england uh and mostly around the uk the other ones will follow but england has totally dumped all mandates they're not doing the vaccines they're not doing the mass thing the social distancing they have decided to have their country back and that's what they said we're getting back to real life they found out in their test that the people who recovered faster by the way from when they did get that virus were the ones who hadn't had the vaccine this is big news everywhere not not not with a bunch of us knew it that you were better off uh just with your natural immunities you know facing that thing and some maybe some other um homeopathic things which means natural things but they when they found out when that report was given to the top person in in london in in europe they said forget it we're ditching it all and this should be in the major news lines already they're ditching it all they're not taking anybody's universe universal mandates forget that happening they said people were better off they're happier they think that kids should be able to smile at each other uh see their families and hug each other and and just let whatever takes its course you know people who don't know this um the flu at one point uh back before this thing came up i think they were calling everything the virus i just have to say that and that is absolute truth i know people went to the doctors and they saw that it was on the records and make them erase it because they had just had the flu they had a head cold anything that they were told in the medical community they had to put it down as that as proof that it was still around i'm not saying it's not there but i'm saying people virus not disease not a plague and that is the truth that's how you have to say it stop calling it a disease or a plague it's not okay the flu is a virus there's different viruses that come around seasonally and i'm not making fun of it because i know there's people who lost their lives mainly probably from the vaccine or how they were handled during that time but i'm telling you the uk especially london is not having anything to do with it literally i think as of today they're ditching it all and the masks are going to be taken off the kids in school in the universities isn't this awesome news i am so excited now if you feel like you have to wear a mask and then wear it but i think we here in america should have the right over our own lives not to be forced or controlled when we are free maybe those people don't want to be free who are mandating it although i think a lot of them have lived a lot freer than the people in this country you're about to see major major changes happen in our own country i do know that one thing was just put forth about demanding people have the uh the uh the vaccine or they lose their jobs i think you're about to see that dumped really fast coming up especially with uh you know the the europe uh getting involved in this stuff one other country it could be switzerland i think possibly that was brought up but i'm getting this is not was it was inside information but now it's known information because they actually put it in the news uh the the head of the um uh of london saying we're not doing this anymore it's over as far as we're concerned it's gonna be life with freedom in it hallelujah thank you jesus we know that's the lord thank you lord thank you god where the spirit of the lord is there's liberty so we thank you holy spirit for moving for all those precious people in london and over those precious children and we declare the same thing over america freedom unmask the children freedom thank you holy spirit for it um it's it's shifting and changing and it's coming here in its fullness so we thank you god is there anything else that you want to share do you want to get into the questions i think that was the main thing i think the only other thing it may not hit the headline yet but it's about to that the the military and this has already been released in many different places not that you'll may see it on our news but our own military have been doing their own covert operations it's not covert anymore uh whether they'll allow it to be said or not but they've been doing tests on the vaccine from day one their cells and this is what happens though when evil tries to take over they overlook a lot of things they think they already have under control not knowing excuse me i'm so excited not knowing when you try to take a country that is free you're going to have the worst days of your life trying to do that because i've lived in this country since i was born obviously and uh i know this about americans you push him too hard and they're going to start saying we're not doing this okay where's your million million army come to try to come and get us it's never going to happen they operate in fear i think those in fear right now a lot of the ones trying to push things on us or hide things from us but the truth will be made known because you're right the truth will make you free amen well let's get into the questions there's a lot of wonderful questions you guys are so all the viewers are so creative in their questions reading through them i'm like oh they're so good and i like it i love it because when we all come together and with our different questions and ask them it taps into different parts of us we haven't yet it gives us revelation deeper revelation when we come all together so the first question i have um is from me because all the logic streams people were like it's the benefit of being god with cat you get to ask her your own questions and i was like when you're in the throne room and there's the altar and the seven blazing torches in front of the throne god says he's an all-consuming fire his angels in his word he says he makes him minister he makes them ministers as flames of fire does like just on earth you know sometimes when an angel comes in the room how the side of your face and your body can get really hot yes is it the same way in the throne room do you when they come and stand beside you do you still feel that heat that radiates off you feel even more so i tell people sometimes i feel like not i don't want to think people think i'm in pain um i don't mean it that way but i feel like i could melt sometimes it's so extreme but it's a different kind of fire it's a different kind of burning and most of it starts on the inside of you before it gets to the outside of you uh your spirit man now when i'm taken to heaven i'm in my spirit man i my body is not there i've never been caught up in my body at all it always stays behind my family's evidence of that they'll come in to say something to me and i just won't move i won't respond i'm not even breathing but i'm still alive don't worry holy spirit just climbs inside of me keeps my body alive uh this is their plan this is the trinity's plan to catch me up and show me so they keep me while my spirit man is in heaven but even my spirit man feels like it's burning uh because of the presence of and that burning is love that's the highest level of fire is the love and yes it does come from the father now i do want to say something about the whole thing about the angels it does say his angels causes ministers to become flames of fire uh when you're baptized in fire and this is also tied into bapti baptism and fire the angelic are part of that are part of the invitations of the baptism and fire and i mean holy spirit was the first one to carry it down we know it came down here we know in the book of acts they all were hit and had flames on their heads how would you love to do that people yeah it was so consuming and i was in israel and i was in the upper room and when i walked in being a seer i saw the portal the holy spirit opened when he came in and brought the fire and there is an open portal in the upper room that has flames still around the whole edges of that thing and that's exactly where holy spirit came in and brought the fire from heaven for the first time and it was placed inside the people to such a measure that it was on them but fire is what makes you bold get ready when that baptism and fire comes it'll burn every care concern every every fear you ever thought you could ever have you won't even be fearful after that you are so consumed with with the living god and our god yeah he is filled with fire let me tell you and that's how the rainbows made from him from the stones of fire that abide inside the father and then the glory uh it hits it and then the waves of the rainbow come in and out of him but no matter where you go in heaven you will experience that same intensity uh even more so when you're with jesus himself his eyes when you look at his eyes in heaven they look like flames of fire it mentions that in the bible too so people try to change things scriptures that they don't understand don't change anything people don't take what's always been there those people from the way past knew what they were talking about they probably had encounters their self uh when it says in him we live we move we have our being the prophets and poets of old talked about those things so actually when it says in him we live we move we have our being that was inside the father that's what the scripture was talking about this revelation we lived in him before you were here okay you played on the stones of fire you swim in the river of life that comes from him this is who you are okay you're not just some weak person trying to get by and stop saying you're no sinner saved by grace you are filled with the love of god you have no sins anymore you're filled with his power with his presence and his purposes in the earth and the more you believe that the more you believe something and receive it the easier it is to get things from god to understand things from god yeah that's amazing just even thinking about the heat and the glory and the presence and the consuming love of god it can overwhelm you in in your spirit here on earth also can we go to the throne room whenever we want to when we're in heaven or how does that work you can go anytime you want to and there's no time in heaven i know when sean bach arrived he was there for a long time he didn't even care about seeing his mansion when he first got there he was so consumed with love from the father and from the son many times when i was caught up there to the throne room he was john park was still in the throne he's left now uh to go see all of his things that that the lord prepared for him but um it's such a powerful place yes you can come you can come whenever you want to everyone who goes to heaven you're there by the grace of god but because you repented right you don't get any holier in heaven so if god if you repented of your sins and you're in heaven there's nothing to keep you from going to the throne room ever you can go there and be in his presence you're there with sometimes masses of people celebrating um sometimes they're dancing sometimes the father sharing revelation with them sometimes you sit in these huge circles around the throne uh the throne is round so this makes sense to me there's four sets of steps going up to the throne so no matter what side you're on you can still run up there it is high and lifted up it's not like you're gonna walk up three feet and be there be there but all the way up you're having these encounters of his presence all the way up to the the throne where he's seated and his son is next to him hallelujah oh i can't wait oh my spirit gets all excited like paul talks about you know we long for that time with him uh so a question that many people have asked is uh steve last week kat you mentioned advice um that she gave you i guess you gave steve advice to help with sleeping and could pat explain more about the rest of god and what people can declare to help them sleep yes it does mention in the bible and people go why don't you give references because i want you to look it up i mean you should look up i mean you can search for like the love of god or the rest of the lord it depends of course on the translations i'm sure that if you look at the king james you're probably going to find it in there for sure because they don't change things i mean they didn't change a lot of stuff and i know people didn't like you know the the way that the wording was and stuff like that like i guess an old english style type thing but let me tell you if it's a unicorn they called it the unicorn people in the bible in the king james version and it's one of my favorite i read many versions but that's one of my favorites because they didn't change those words so it talks about the rest of the lord and um i know people who've experienced that i use jesse to plant us all the time because he talked about it he had been ministering everywhere for and he still does wow jesse's still out there doing it and that jesse duplantis is hilarious he lived a very strange unusual life growing up didn't know god or anything and had an encounter i mean he had an encounter and uh but he had a praying mama and let me tell you what she didn't let go of him so all you praying moms keep it up so anyway he was traveling he was very getting weary and he checked into his hotel room and he's supposed to be at the meeting place and he never showed up he came the next day and told people what happened he had he had been plowing and out there working and ministering and and the holy spirit would you know impress him you need to rest you need to rest and i guess heaven got tired of him not resting he was in his room and an angel appeared in jesse's room and he came up and he either touched him or put his hand over him he said the rest of the lord upon you and he fell backwards on his bed and slept like 20 hours oh my gosh that's awesome it really does work it does work and you declare it you can even say i declare i won't say i'm not i'm not saying this over me now i'm just explaining holy spirit okay he's my best friend he's quite a character and uh but if i was gonna say that if i travel travel travel and i've got so much going on here right here where i'm at you know when your studio is in your home it's one thing but when your offices are in your home you really like it work all the time and since i'm up all the time it's never ending stuff that i have to do plan uh draw a schedule a revelation to write down it's like it's it's never ending and i'm okay with that but sometimes i get really tired every now and then i'll just say that myself though the rest of the lord upon you man i'm out and i'll sleep like 14 hours [Laughter] that's awesome it is not just to say it is actually a thing a thing that you can ask for and declare over and just get ready to be in a place where you're going to go to sleep [Laughter] okay so i know paul was asking this behind the scenes earlier uh for you know can you have her explain that so that's going to help a lot of people so just declare that over yourself before you sleep right just to clear it obviously not while you're driving [Laughter] while you're in your bed ready no not while you're on a plane they may have to wake you up or carry you out be wise with your declarations yes be wise okay whatsoever you say that's one of those things you'll have what's whoever you say so laura wants to know can you ask cat if the movies that artists make in heaven have any influence on filmmakers here on earth i think um i don't quite know how to answer that um there are people and i know you're probably not talking about this but when people who do that for a living they make it to heaven yay that's what they'll be doing in heaven it's their gift and they have all types of new um material and understanding and revelation uh for making the movies in heaven but the whole uh plan of god is to tell stories that's what jesus did when he was on the earth he told stories all the time the father still does it in the throne room they love that they love to tell stories of visional things and have things uh you know explanation to see images or share things and uh god is definitely for movies and heaven they don't have to have ratings allow that because when people think well depending on what they go and see i hope you're not seeing the other kind of stuff what goes in your soul what you watch with your eyes is going to go in your soul and some things you don't ever want to let in your soul but the movies in heaven are intense exciting they're funny they're beautiful and i do have to say this there are images set on purpose from heaven down into the mind of scriptwriters screenwriters producers uh i don't know how many people say i have this great idea for a movie you know i hope one day somebody makes a movie about this i i hear that almost all the time i am writing scripts myself and which is going to be pretty powerful now that's the commission to do that but yes there are things in heaven that happen the way they do things things that are are living there or architecture that's there it definitely is on purpose dropped down into the mind of people who are creative on the earth so that they can produce those things like that whether it by doing those images or words they put with those images is is kind of up to what's in the soul of the person making the movies but the movie the home movie industry is definitely has available to them revelation being sent on purpose so that people will know different things even some of the things you see in some of the sci-fi movies like star wars and other things i literally see some of the way things happen or images i've seen literally in heaven i see them in some of the star wars movies it's really really powerful when that happens wow that must be so cool for you you're probably like oh that's from heaven like i could imagine watching it oh that's what happened jen hears it all the time we're usually the ones who go check out movies you know if they're like g maybe pg i don't think we see much anything beyond that uh all of our movies most all of our movies will be g or pg but there won't be anything no i'll just give you heavens uh code for raiding in movies uh if a movie is a g on the earth the the angels in heaven will say well it's it's good most of the way or if it's pg s is partly good some of the time pg-13 it's only good 13 of the time i heard you also say one time when you do go into a movie um that's wrong or bad or violent or that the demonic realm i mean they vomit on your head as you walk into the theater is that that shocked me but my spirit resonated that at such truth well they mark you they have to have a way to mark you two reasons number one so they can pursue dragging you into deeper stuff okay because you can't wash these marks off unless it's something you repent for i would encourage people do not see anything that's got graphic violence profanity sexuality or witchcraft which crafts a big one a lot of people like that type of thing now there's a big difference in safe fantasy like you know um i know the narnia movies are really powerful especially the first three you can tell i've been talking a lot that's okay but it's very important that you understand that what you enter into this is how holy spirit says they're so simple in heaven when they explain something whatever you enter into will enter into you now i'm not saying that you'll get possessed by things but things will attach themselves to you or follow you i need my hot chocolate jen i didn't get to have my hot chocolate yet people that's like my coffee and um so anyway um being a seer that was one of the first things i noticed uh when i started going to movies i go down the hallway well i never go into any of the bad ones and usually you can check them out online to see what's actually in the movie and uh they've been really not good in this last year maybe the last two years but especially the last year even some of the things on television even in the commercials they've stuck in a lot of things that are indecent or uh or outright witchcraft stuff and i'm talking about just regular tv and the commercials you got to make sure you know what's going on and what's coming on your screen but i walked in and i saw these ledges and i see both sides all the time i see the dark and i see the the operations of the host of the angelic and of the darkness and they had demons sitting on a ledge it's a spiritual ledge you're not going to go into theater and see unless you're a seer and they were waiting and whoever went in that r-rated movie got vomited on it's like a green slime when they came out it was still on there walking down the hallway still down there so no matter what you think you're doing and nobody knows somebody knows the whole spirit realm knows that you've gone into something that you shouldn't have seen with your eyes or heard or uh or listened the actions that are going on in that thing there's a reason why they make it restricted is what they say r is for remember heaven says it's rotten and so i will sometimes walk in to the theater as i'm going to my theater probably at the end you know the decent fun movie i like funny movies a decent one and um and i'll see these things i'll walk up i'll get almost next to them i'll go i evict you in jesus name and they almost vomit on themselves because they don't know i can see them unless i say something and just like well i had a question asked is satan know everything you think no he knows what thoughts he puts in you and he knows that you received it by the response you give to the thoughts he's given you but he's not omnipresent he's not omniscient on this and he doesn't know everything all at the same time which is another reason why they mark you if you do something that's sinful or against god they mark you because then uh they know who to pursue because satan doesn't know everything and then he'll send or assign sometimes them to you to get you uh to go into deeper areas of darkness and so if you've done things like that make sure your pencils wiped off hello people they have a whole system in the spirit realm that we don't have here and because you can't see and you think that god's okay with it because he said hasn't said anything to you no he lives by his own word you know what's right what's wrong if you just read the word of god and usually inside your spirit man if it has a red flag about something then don't be a part of it don't just go with your friends because they want to go see a seance or they want to go see something like that whole thing they had happened that was like made up to satan that big event they had recently and i think people died in there and nobody should go into anything like that i think this is just a fun thing around you know the fake holiday halloween uh around that time they have a lot of these things that people think well this is special this is different that is not a fantasy okay evil wicked spiritual stuff is not a fantasy it is a reality and you want to be careful what you enter into you don't want to take things home with you or even be in your home this is the reality of the spirit realm however when you're out doing things for god you help people you love people god also writes your name in the book he don't necessarily put a mark on you but he put your name in the book they helped this person this day they gave this money to the homeless person they helped them find a place to stay they were kind to this person whose heart was broken uh he he makes a book of remembrance that he will then bless you from so either side somehow is making notes okay and all of that just from that one question about the movie theater but that's true anywhere i go i see hell's activity everywhere uh las vegas is one of the worst places and he had me go there i went there and spoke and i'm telling you what one day one day that will be a region of light god's taken las vegas not because he wants it because he marked it for himself a long time ago places that are marked by god for his purpose as the enemy on purpose wants to try to defile them one day it will be called the city of his son las vegas will not be called the city of sin because the city of his son and that while i was there i had a lot of encounters but i saw the demonic following people into places where they shouldn't be going and i would just tell you if they try to hand you a pack on the street corner las vegas don't take it don't take it it usually has an x on it you don't want that thing because evil spirits go with every packet that was given one went with that person who took that packet wow that's so powerful your life goes on in this world you think this is all there is and you're wrong this is all temporary what you're seeing with your natural eyes is temporary the unseen realm is what made the the same things okay god made them it says all that you see was made by the unseen realm in the unseen realm are both sides until the day everything is ended and all the evil wickedness is put away into the lake of fire which will happen a long way down the road so don't look for that to happen but until then you keep your guard up it says guard your heart that's your soul for out of it will be the way you live your life is the truest scripture in the bible except for being born again and so yeah my life is not different i go to the mall i see all this activity from both sides going on and uh i have learned to train my eyes to stay where god wants them unless he wants me to go up and say something to somebody which sometimes he does have me say something and i love the holy spirit because the holy spirit's not scared to go into the dark places no he's not and he's not scared to bring the light of christ into the places we would say oh that's you know i i love that about him because he he's not held back by anything he he will go and reach the lost where he needs to go and infiltrate yeah and all that you just shared has i know opened i i feel it in the spirit that a lot of people are they're feeling they're repenting for things they've they've seen or done but this is the truth this truth needs to get out because it's going to help you progress with your walk with god get closer to the heart of god yeah the whole point of the enemy the enemy satan he is our number one enemy of satan because he's really in charge of the wrongs being done now uh he can't create anything good there's nothing good that comes out from from hell or from the devil and the ones trying to control our country they are actually cannot control good they can't they cannot create anything good because it isn't in them okay that's why we're trying to let you know don't go further or chase the darkness because you'll end up by getting gray on the inside of you if you looked at you i would see gray light okay get it out evict it from your soul just repent for things you probably shouldn't have said or gone to or read but you're right about the holy spirit he is a bold and he's about to touch all flesh in this earth and boy is that going to be something that's going to happen when that goes on but no sometimes you let me walk up to somebody you know and i don't like the fact that people think every tattooed pierced person is wicked that's not true either some have markings from god god assigned them to have that done that might not be the norm but you can't put everybody in a box you just can't do that and we are to love everybody no matter who they are if nothing else i will send the life of god into buildings that i know are filled with things that they're doing wrong i'll send the fire of god the love of god to bring freedom uh to the people who are there there are people praying for those people and your prayers are powerful because holy spirit can go the angelic can go even it's not somewhere where you'd normally see somebody like sharing the truth or something like that i send it into all of those places i pray for the souls of the people either doing those acts or or or you know bringing them so people can be a part of them i'm always careful to make sure that there is hope for people's souls amen beautiful and i'm going to skip to a question because someone asked about um about being marked let me find that question um okay so um teresa asked or tressa asked in ephesians 1 13 it says you were marked in him with a seal is this a literal seal that we can see in heaven and do you do you want me to read ephesians 1 13 and 14 um which which which translation is it yeah let me let me read i think i'm reading out of um new king james in him you also trusted after you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also having believed you were sealed with the holy spirit of promise who is the guarantee of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession to the praise of his glory so she's asking it says there you are marked in him with the seal is that a literal seal that we can see in heaven i um that mark has to do with the holy spirit um when you're born again of course once you're born again you then have the promise of the holy spirit coming no one can keep him from you it really is talking more about the holy spirit at that point that's why christ sent him and he even said jesus said i have to go but i will send the one who comes after me uh you know and the holy spirit does so many things for us i'm glad you even you that you brought him up but the holy spirit will begin to pursue people especially who have that seal it's a seal of his blood that's what that seal is when you get to heaven is something you literally can see when you are born again is one of the most powerful things in the spirit that ever happens on this earth many things happen in heaven when you're receiving christ uh the father comes and takes the stone of fire from himself and places it in your spirit and then your spirit man has light on the inside uh jesus gives you a deposit of the anointing he walks in that's first john 2 27 if you want the scripture many things happen that you're not aware of and most pastors don't even know these things are happening they do know your name is written in the lamb's book of life and that that seals you for eternity uh another promises given to you is eternal life um everybody everybody it will live forever it depends on you choose where you're going to live you're going to live in uh you know in heaven now and then on the new earth with the lord or will you live forever with the enemy in eventually the lake of fire but that seal is two things it is a seal with the promise of the holy spirit coming to come and abide in you which now is available to you before it wasn't you cannot have holy spirit dwell in an unclean person so what that mainly was talking about was you the seal the promise of the holy spirit now being allowed to enter into you and what he does is when you get born again holy spirit will come alongside you he will come immediately and come alongside you the bible talks about that but when you and ask and invite him to indwell you there's an opening made from that seal the holy spirit knows it and understands it and he can enter into you so this is a lot of deep stuff for some people but they do they do have marks there's two other marks you get too one is the name the name of your god in the palm of your hand and the name of the city of your god in your forehead and for all those who understand about end time stuff you know that in the last days when the antichrist is on the earth that's several hundred years from now people uh certainly look he's not on the earth right now but when he comes uh he will want to mark people with a mark in the palm of their hand and in their forehead and that is why he knows that god does that it's like mocking god so you are marked with those visible marks and in heaven you can see these visible marks it's it's really it's it's written not in a known language but you'll get a mark right here that's the name of your god okay that's jesus christ and up here is the name of the city of your god that those are marks so you are marked in in those ways but the seal of the promise is for holy spirit then having permission to come alongside you when you're born again and then the most important thing you'll do besides getting born again is invite the holy spirit to indwell you and then he goes from here to living in you and i know holy spirit is an unlimited layered being which is why he's everywhere all at the same time but you don't get a little part of him you get a whole of him living in you and then your life really begins to change i hope that helped hallelujah and that answer is cassandra's question too because she asked is there anything similar to tattoos in heaven what is is there anything similar to tattoos in heaven yeah there are and i want you to know people that god was the first one to mark uh satan steals everything we actually have not that i'm selling but i'm letting you know one of those powerful revelations on the cd uh is called copycat and it shares everything in the scriptures and things that's on heaven that satan when he came to the earth wants to defile it and take it for himself marking doesn't actually belong to satan it belongs to god he marked you know um remember he marked cain in the garden remember that he put a mark on him people would see so they wouldn't kill him he's going to mark 144 000 uh jews uh in the last days a mark you visibly can see um there are other times in the bible or talked about people god putting a mark on them uh that's god god marx that's his part of his m.o and satan to insult him would get people to put satan would get people to put his marks on them and so there's i've seen people with both like they used to have the one kind but they got born again and they had marks of god i happen to know that my own daughter god told her to put um she has lightning bolts on her he told her put brass knuckles on her feet and i don't mean little ones i mean brass knuckles because she dances for him it's his gift and god said you wore in the spirit when you dance therefore you will have these uh brass knuckles on your feet that's from god that was something god requested of her she didn't even hesitate to do it she told me after she did it and as she's telling me the holy spirit said that was that was a command from god for her to do that to represent what she is for him i know other people who god has said i want these marks of my marks representing me put on you and that's going to begin to increase and i will say this if you're not if you're not an adult yet make sure you let your parents know or discuss it with your parents in many way until you be commented an adult and make sure you're hearing the right thing but there are many powerful things lightning bolts belong to god the fire all belongs to god and we know that um one of the images of course that represents hell is skulls people go well that's your that's your skeleton yeah but most people don't put it on them because it represents it's supposed to represent death and we know that god says this day i let you choose choose life or death you if you have decided if you are an adult and you want to put a mark on you i would make sure it's something that portrays the image of god and not hell okay and if you can get them changed i will say this there's going to be a move of god one day on this earth that will actually erase many of the wicked tattoos this is for believers many of the wicked tattoos put on them that they had put on them in in one of these moves of god coming that will be wiped off of them i've heard testimonies of ministers praying for people with tattoos that they had before they were born again with gang affiliation and stuff and the lord removed it supernaturally yes that is that's what you're talking about that's amazing that's right supernaturally just gone you know praise god don't have to go through the pain that's right you don't have to go through the pain amen um kel ass in proverbs 8 um calls wisdom a she and her what does this mean is wisdom a woman and i'm just going to read proverbs um 8 1-3 out of new living translation listen as wisdom calls out here as understanding raises her voice on the hilltop along the road she takes her stand at the crossroads by the gates at the entrance to the town on the road leading in she cries out loud so kel wants to know um is wisdom a woman um it's not it's not a woman you wouldn't call uh any an angel a male or female you wouldn't call them that they have the appearance of them but a spirit is not man or woman okay so i know she didn't understand this i'll let you know yes it looks like a female it is feminine appearance in every single way her voice uh she is a spiritual being is the proper way to say that she is a spiritual being in heaven uh and of course she's sent down here to the earth sometimes to bring wisdom to people um it is always a good thing to ask for sound wisdom if you want to ask god for something there's many things you can ask him for you know like extreme discernment don't do that unless you're ready to have things revealed but sound wisdom is a good thing but wisdom is a feminine spirit she looks beautiful and i've seen her in heaven i've seen her on the earth and i don't know why some people think everything has to look like a male if the father can be both okay the father can be uh and have um you know what that's why god said let's make man in our image right let's make man in our image and after our likeness is how they operate and then he said and we will make them male and female and there's a reason why he made them male and female so that we would when whenever we would be married we would have a way to have be connected together we would create soul ties together but there are many feminine spiritual beings in heaven and i want to go back to the seven tortures you talked about uh those flames those torches are seven spiritual beings they serve the father i've seen them um the flames never go out but they'll step out of that there's seven spiritual beings that serve the father himself uh they they belong to him and uh and always have belonged to him so things are represented in different images in heaven but those seven flames of those churches before the throne are seven spiritual beings that serve the father continually the same thing is spirit the wisdom is a feminine spirit she can go in and out of the father to get directions from him or instructions from him or even impartations that she brings to the earth sometimes and will walk through somebody and leave it inside that person so we need desperately in the body of christ to have spirit around boot camp we need a greater understanding of what the spirit realm is and how that operates why did god make it well it always has existed actually that's where he's always existed in but but there are spiritual beings that look feminine heaven there's some that take care of the forest the streams i've seen them they're very beautiful looking they have beautiful song when they sing in places in heaven so some of the seraphim they live in the glory cloud over the throne they some of them look feminine some look masculine i mean you know their their faces and whatever but they have hair that looks like looks like it's on fire and they'll dip down out of the glory cloud over the throne and they get more of the glory on them then they go back up they never stop singing over him so yeah spirit uh the spirit of wisdom is a spiritual being and she does look feminine that's that's amazing thank you for that revelation even about the seven spirits of god that's that's awesome don asks cat has said that the hosts have their own language does their language sound tribal almost like native american languages um i wouldn't say it sounds tribal it's uh if they're talking to each other i don't necessarily understand but of course they can they speak in english to me when they speak they use the language that i understand and know um i would say the tribe part is right uh they got that down and the native american tribes were not the first tribes okay the jewish tribes were around that's why they made tribes that's why the father made tribes right the 12 tribes of israel remember that that's because in heaven when he made the the host and when he made the angels they were made in tribes like there's a whole like the royal guard let's use them this very very extremely high level of dominion authority and power are the royal guard they all look like lions that doesn't mean they walk on all fours their faces look very similar to lions is just what he decided to choose them but there's tribes there's tribes of the royal guard and they all look very similar i mean you can identify them in heaven you know they're from this tribe of the host or this tribe of their scouts those are tribes um there's um i'm trying to think of some of the other ones but there they have a title like a title of the tribe they're a part of that is what they're sent for that's what they were designed for some are couriers there's a on the angelic side that's under gabriel there's there's couriers there's scribes there's worker angels there's ones who deal in the body parts in the warehouse all those are tribes created for gabriel but the host is the army most of them look like creatures but there's a whole tribes of them so there's not just like one of this one or one of that one they're all individual ones they all have personalities uh so the tribe thing that part is right but the the language that the host the the host of heaven which are the armies of heaven they understand the commands they're the ones who take the commands to go in war on our behalf even did that and for israel back in the ancient days uh as said in isaiah that the captain of the host that would be michael went to the far ends of heaven and gathered the army to fight on behalf of israel and i can tell you this i do know that michael's headquarters in heaven is at the the bottom it's a world because the that's why the earth is round i'm always going to say that the earth is not flat heaven is not flat it's a world called the father's house and at the top part of this world is where the throne excuse me the throne room is and all that that stuff going on but at the bottom part hidden in clouds of glory dark glory a dark glory doesn't mean it's black people it's if you took a million peacock feathers because in these clouds of glory that that will will wrap around all of michael's headquarters are millions of eyes those are living eyes and they're even in these clouds of glory that that will cover and and protect because heaven's army headquarters is not a tourist attraction in heaven i keep saying that you're invited to go there in the throne room you don't have to be invited but at heaven's at michael's place you're going to have to be invited to get to see that place and so god even has diagrammed and laid out heaven itself that world called heaven to have specific things specific tribes of the host or the angelic being involved with it he does have a way he plans things god has a memo a mode of operations and he's very uh specific and perfected in all those ways that's beautiful and it's really amazing how he said about all the eyes because the first thing i thought of was the wheel within the wheel yeah and the the cherubim with all the eyes so we see that in scripture about about what you just said and let's see i think this will be um the last question for today we're already an hour i can't believe it um so margaret asks do we have a new name in heaven if so does everyone get the memo about our new name when you go to heaven this is when you go to move there i don't i well i have i have a little nickname the father gives me i won't give that to anybody but the father loves to name things he loves even places in heaven have names that he's given to them uh that new name will be like a little nickname which is something only he calls you and only you and he will know it and it actually says in the bible that he'll write on a stone it says that in the bible that's not a river rock it is a white diamond and he will write that name and he will give it to you and you and he will know that name it's not going to be something that's going to be passed on have you not going to run tell your friend oh this is my name the father gave this it isn't like that um your own friends will probably call you the same nickname they did on the earth by the way well unless it wasn't nice and they'll pick a new one but the new name you get in heaven is something special that the father chooses to call you and yes he is going to personally give you that that white diamond that stone whenever it says stone in heaven is talking about gemstones he will write that on there and give it to you and that's probably what he will call you uh whenever you come to meet with his per him personally or something and uh yeah he likes to personalize everything so you will get a new name it won't be some big o drawn out name that you can't remember or understand it'd be something precious from the love of god to your heart that's what it will be thank you so much for being on with us today and answering all the questions and just releasing so much truth into our spirits um you guys receive so much spiritually just in this hour of this impartation from heaven uh comes straight into my spirit whenever i

the air of things that are about to happen and and just flow over this earth it's not the rapture okay i know people say i'm wrong but guess what there's they said that 10 years ago 20 years ago and and i don't argue about who's right or wrong i know god has a timetable in heaven he has his own uh timeline and we're not even anywhere near close to the very end he expects all the things he promised his son that we would walk in before the end comes the world will know us as believers because of our love for each other so when you see that start happening you get excited about that but i'm excited about being here i want to be here i want to be a part of everything he's doing so just stay excited celebrate maybe eat smaller pieces of cake but he's still telling me the ek he can

hey we're back jeff are we live jeff jeff are we yes yes we are we are live hey everybody something weird well okay i'll just say this happy wednesday february 2 2022. uh it's nice to be back as i have to be back and alive uh minus uh 10 pounds since you all saw me last i got knocked down on the back side and uh i'm just coming back but i appreciate you all i know thousands of you've been praying and sending notes and we i really really appreciate that drea and i both got this thing bad um i suppose it was the variant that people talk about because you know i never lost my sense of taste or smell like some people talk about so anyway thanks for supporting me and supporting the show and supporting kelsey kelsey did a superb job kelsey so i i do have an issue with talking um sometimes the coughing thing will just decide to kick in there and so jeff is ready that if for any reason something happens and i can't uh i can't stop the coughing then i'll just call for him and say jeff you go ahead and pick it up from here and then he'll keep asking questions okay so um i think with just to minimize talking i think without further ado let's bring in cat here hello everybody good to see you cat it's good to see you thank you steve and uh we're still playing energy life strength wholeness in jesus name right now we're not towering that attack on your body we command the whole servant again to pull down every spirit of infirmity make that thing like dust in jesus name and the life of god to you this day yeah oh i received that i totally received it well cat well i'm as i told you before the show i'm going to keep my questions short so that i don't talk as much and you and um but let's jump right in uh well let's before we jump into the questions uh anything you want to say because things have happened in the news since you and i were last on together anything you'd like to say about current events a lot of things have happened i'm very excited about the convoys um yeah that in both in canada and you know the one here in america it's showing this land that we the free people are not putting up with any more junk garbage control or deception i think it's probably the worst days the left are the liberals no matter where they're from canada or here i think it's probably the worst days they've had so far since this whole thing started because even this late in the game it is a game satan thinks he's playing but let me tell you god is moving those those things across the board and i can tell you what i knew eventually that the people would get fed up and make a stand and that's what's happening and that that should get you so excited everyone out there should be so excited that it's the people making the stand yes i know god's going to come in he is going to do something amazing and magnificent but how wonderful that they're seeing that these people think they've got us in controlling us they're realizing they don't have us at all and so i really want to uh thank thank god right now for protection for those convoys god i know that you have a purpose in them thank you for all the supply they need while they're out there thank you for covering all of us because they're carrying the supply for us but they need to be supplied right now you are with prayer with protection uh just with the life of god in all those trucks no accidents hold-ups delays or breakdowns or attacks of any kind that's what i'm declaring in jesus name so yes it's making a stand like never before i don't think this has happened in probably years in this country i know probably never in canada have the people ever stood up like they are right now saying we aren't taking this we're not putting up with it they're believing god that they'll even have a replacement in the leadership there and i tell you they will get it they will get what they're asking for they're doing what's right right now and so i'm fully supporting the convoy that's going in canada i think it's going from british columbia all the way over to i can't remember i think quebec i think it's where it's headed uh but there's all kinds of things this is the stuff about um the wonderful thing about this is no news media can keep people from finding out what's happening because everybody's sharing you everywhere whether in canada or here um at home if you didn't know it yes there's a convoy if they haven't left already it'll be going from california all the way across to dc how about that put it in their face that they're not going to tolerate this stuff anymore that is a sure sign that that foundation the evil has been standing on is crumbling to nothing i'm quite sure a lot of them are making different choices like where can i run to or where can i hide they're coming after us that's probably what they think so i just want you know i'm celebrating over this whole thing but keep them in prayer and their family members you know that god will cover all of them and i'm just really grateful and excited and i had told people the very last of this last year watched the first quarter of this year 2022 it's a powerful year but in 2022 more exposure and more patriotism and the people standing up will happen than this happened in all this time since this whole thing started so this is a sure sign that movement towards righteousness justice and freedom it's already started yeah it's been so gratifying i wish i hadn't been so sick to enjoy those convoys more but you know now i'm at the tail end of this thing and it's such a gratifying thing to see truckers i think there's like 50 000 or maybe more than that trucks and i mean the last time we talked about convoys was back in the day when people had see cb radios and ev there was a song about convoys and all that and that's all and it was more of a fun thing you know uh but now this is like deadly serious fun but it is fun i'm serious but let me tell you some of the a couple things um a couple things every overpass that they have to drive under these trucks in this whole journey people have lined these overpasses so that the truckers will see them and they'll stand there even in the freezing cold where it's cold uh they're bundled up they've got signs they've got bull horns they are cheering them on uh for the freedom that they're they're helping to take back for all of us so even the truckers are being inspired people are setting up camps wherever these truckers stop and they've got food prepared for them they've got things that they need you know something if they re replacements wherever they need in their in their vehicles or stuff done to them and this is being done free out of love for the stand that uh they're making together is something the people coming together which is one of the things we've been praying all along so the there's not it is the truckers but it's also all these other people thousands of them being involved as they go through every state or every county or whatever even in canada that the same thing is happening and i do know this some americans went up into canada to help with this whole the canadian uh convoy too and there's thousands of trucks there but i'm pretty certain there's over 50 000 right now uh and and the the american ones i don't even know where they're gonna they get enough to join them they may line the thing without even having to drive anywhere because more and more people are getting excited about it so yeah so they're being having food hot food prepared for them uh drinks to take with them coffee and stuff like that coffee stops and so uh it is really a wonderful thing you know and trudeau up there in canada the the latest rumors are he supposedly got the uh virus to watch this coughing here um but it's also rumored that he didn't have the virus at all he just went and hid out because he said they know we're coming for it well we're not going to come for them violence-wise i hope uh but they know what we're coming for we're coming for them but we're just not going to hurt them but yeah i don't mind if they lock them up i really don't mind if they lock them up what did they think what did all these elites not just in canada but australia the us what did they think we were going to do when they tried to take our freedom away from us you know what did they think this was going to turn out like i was i know it's supposed to not be violent violent not liking the natural uh violence right but the very number of the people coming is so shocking because you know so many have remained silent they just remain silent and put up with stuff that is going on but you reach a limit if you're a free person in free country there's just so much you're gonna take especially here in america we are america the land is the free the brave and the bold and we know that this country is our country we the people have this country and a god lets us decide on things so just because they decide they're going to be a dictatorship it's not going to last very long and i think that part has ended as far as the people are concerned and i think they're so shocked that the number you know they've heard a few from it they've tried to hide everybody they've done their best to blot out our voices or stop things from being heard but you can't stop the action you cannot stop you know fifty thousand trucks is probably two or three uh people in each truck and all the people coming along to help provide for them that is a massive site and there's no way on god's earth can these people hide that which is the most terrifying thing they can't stop it they can't do anything about it so they don't know they don't know what's going to happen which is the best part the people who who are being they're they're being shown that we're not putting up with this anymore the leftist the liberals they don't know what's going to happen they just know something is started that's not going to stop towards taking our freedom i think that's the best part yeah so where are they coming for well let's see if you're ready to jump into some other questions um i'm going to try and keep them short just because of this cuff so you ready for the first one oh i'm ready all right so and i think we've talked about this one time months ago but the question the viewers are asking is what does god think about cremation is it okay i was just let me tell you first of all the what the holy spirit told me when the first time i was caught up to heaven this was his statement please tell them it's okay if they cremate uh they can still put the ashes back together and it's a lot cheaper and that's actually what he said to tell people it's a lot cheaper you know what the ashes are even if you sprinkle them somewhere but i have to they're using that script in the bible that says i think it's in leviticus do not allow yourself to be passed to the fire and they make that one scripture the whole law about no cremation and yet back in the day most people uh leaving all religious religion out or whatever you want christianity out of the whole scene the way that one number one way that they would dispose of the bodies was to burn them because number one they didn't know they don't it was harder to dig in the ground especially over if you've ever been in the over in the mid east and places like that it is not easy to dig anything in that dirt there's so much stone and stuff so a lot of them were automatically going to be cremated with just the number one way of choice um just for um you know to keep things not having dead bodies laying around and things like that make it sound like that but it was the easiest and the safest way to dispose of the bodies was that they were cremated god does not care and let me tell you people think well if i'm cremated i won't have a body to be resurrected if he made you out of nothing and this is the truth if he made you and everything around you with nothing he can totally get your body back together every molecule every part of it he knows what it is and i want to say this if you think you're you're hurting yourself by being cremated that god doesn't want you to have a body you know to bring back what about the ones who were eaten by sharks they were killed in an explosion they were killed in a fire they're they're you know they're pretty much ashes and god wants you to know he can put you back together this is not a a spiritual ritual not like you know and the side of the darkness it's not about that back in the day in leviticus that was a book of laws that's when a lot of the laws were made because at that point in mankind they needed them some of them were doing something very uh not not good things wicked things evil things and so that's why there was laws laid down to follow and that that that one made do not allow yourself to be passed through the fire is not even talking about cremation whenever something like that comes up especially in the leviticus or one of those books that talk about the ancient days you have to look at the culture of the day and what was going on uh when they said don't like the best of fire people literally were taking their arms and burning them they were putting on all fruits to burn them even parts of them or family members i don't want to add that but this is how bad it was back in that day and so god was going to stop all that he wanted that stopped you can't give people his burnt offerings they were doing that and so that was why that was made you're not allowed to have to pass through the fire was literally don't take parts of you and burn it on the altar to some wicked god that's what they were doing so that was made for that purpose it had nothing to do with you cannot be cremated and so he actually when he sent me back from heaven the first time tell everybody it's okay to be cremated is cheaper and it really is thousands and thousands of dollars less to be cremated if you want to put them in a jar or something like that excuse me find something nice i've been talking a lot if you want to find something nice to to put their ashes in that's perfectly fine if you want to put them in a niche you know at a cemetery or something that's also okay if you want to spread them on the river if that was their decision to do that he knows where every one of those ashes are and you'll be able to put them back together but really realistically i know since we we have sent my one brother on to glory it was like forty thousand dollars uh forty to eighty thousand dollars to have a standard funeral that included the casket and the burial and all of that was very expensive we had my brother cremated like we did the rest of our family members and then you know uh it's okay you know we we know where they are they're in their jars they're in their little things treasure chest whatever um but it's okay with god to do that because i think it was like i don't know you can i think you can get cremation done for like a thousand dollars sometimes less depending on where you where you take that body to be done most funeral homes do perform cremations and you can actually still have a ceremony with a picture of them there maybe the the beautiful urn or whatever you have them put in and to me it was still just a sign of release and releasing them into heaven i planned this whole service it was a joyful one we actually celebrated we ate and we sang and it was a beautiful thing to send somebody off to heaven but please don't let people's opinions or their misinterpretation of the scriptures keep you from not having to spend tens of thousands of dollars i've actually had people call crying saying i should have had them buried the proper way we could only afford cremation i went then you did the right thing and they're okay with that in heaven by the way your family members are okay with that that's awesome that's awesome though that's gonna encourage a lot of people can't so all right this next question we talked about just before you came on the air um there's so much i could say but the bottom line is there's this thing going around about the flat earth talk talk to the people about this thing and what what does god put on your heart to say about all these people believing in a flat earth first of all talk a little bit about what they think it is what they think it is not what it is okay right someone had in their head it always starts with a thought in somebody's head a man's head not gods okay obviously uh so what they do when they think well i really for some reason i believe and some of them can use ancient maps from when people cross the ocean and they actually would draw at that time they drew it flat they didn't normally they have no conception of how to draw like a curved earth and show a map with the water and the travel um uh the travel route of where they were going to go so it made sense to draw just a flat thing and then show the shipping ship going across and a lot of the charts were made like that way back then some are even still made that way it's just out of convenience but whenever these thoughts come usually it's the enemy and i have to tell you the enemy sometimes doesn't just give wicked thoughts he gives stupid ones because yeah if he can't get you to go into sin if he can't get you to fall apart and just you know dissolve and give up your whole life then he will get you distracted and some of the biggest distractions going on in the earth right now are some of the most ridiculous things and but this flat earth thing they consider it a thing it's a society which means it's a group of people who've dedicated themselves to prove the earth is flat millions of dollars have been wasted on that and i know you'll say what about nasa what about all that stuff i'll address that in a minute but they will come back to you i know people who got out of it and i mean literally got out of it they had to call sam they had to call and say i'm no longer part of this take me off of the roll don't count me in anymore i'm not throwing my money away because they had revelation from god the earth is round okay a world is round okay and the earth is a shadow and a type of heaven so the earth in the planets are styled after heaven itself heaven is a world and i know i laugh about all this because a lot of people when they draw heaven they draw a flat place up in the sky with a few clouds thrown in for free maybe a rainbow dazzling across the clouds it isn't any of that it is a literal world it says in the book of john or jesus said in my father's house are many mansions that house is not a building it's not a square thing which shutters on and a roof it is a whole world it would take the world to put heaven because heaven is bigger than our entire galaxy system and uh and there's a lot going on there there's real life there in your spiritual body but the flat earth thing back to the flat earth society i have to throw this in for free um before the flat earth thing came up probably somebody who believed in the middle earth decided to make it a flat earth because they could never prove there was a middle earth there was a whole middle earth society probably maybe 50 years ago or before that a little bit that they believed because the bible talked about descending and they talked about abraham's bosom or paradise which is in the center of the earth that is a spiritual abode and in paradise or abraham's bosom was where all the righteous who were counted as righteous by god like moses abraham isaac you know uh before jesus christ died on the cross and shed his blood other than elijah and enoch who the father took up to heaven himself still in their natural bodies nobody ascended into heaven when they died before jesus came and paid a price to give us a way back to the father they descended into this gloriously beautiful place which i have seen called abraham's bosom and it says that in the bible it also calls it paradise and i have proved when jesus was on the cross with the two thieves the one of them was just bashing him you know they were laughing making mocking him but the other thief said don't don't do anything and he's done nothing wrong and so he turns his head towards jesus says remember me when you come into your kingdom in other words he was repenting he said i'm a sinner you know i i deserve this but but you don't talking to jesus so remember me when you come into your kingdom so he was saying i have sinned i repented the sins i receive you as my lord and savior on the cross by the way without getting baptized in water or baptism in the holy spirit so you people out there demanding everybody have all these things done traditions done and there's nothing wrong with them but you must repent of your sins and believe on jesus christ as your savior that's how you get to heaven so jesus turns his head to the stephen says to him today you shall be with me in paradise well obviously the cross is not paradise israel's not paradise what was he talking about jesus himself was going to descend into paradise which was higher up than where hell was you can actually see from a part of paradise you can see a little bit of the gates of hell which would be a little bit further down but a big wolf was between paradise and hell and nobody could cross over by the way it wasn't something you could do in your spiritual body you couldn't go from one place to the other and so people began to look for paradise and there was a whole group unfortunately started here in florida there were the mid middle earth people middle earth society and they said if they walked along the beach far enough it was a downward thing they would then enter into the middle earth well we know that's a joke just like the flat earth society is a joke and i think because they could never find middle earth they decided to call it a flat earth and therefore they began to search the scriptures to find what things they could make to find to prove the earth was flat and they came up with two different ones which don't mean at all what they say they mean number one if you don't have revelation from the father part of the word is talking about the spirit realm it isn't always talking about this natural realm there's a scripture that talks about the four corners of the earth and that is one of the main ones they these in this flatter society see there's corners that means it has to be flat it can't be round and the first time i heard that i was like i was in shock i laughed out loud i went you do realize that scripture is talking about the north south east and west those are directions that has nothing to do with the earth is flat whatsoever and and then there's another one that talks about the columns there's columns or pillars that are holding up under the earth and so they say look it's flat it's sitting on a table like thing there's a structure with legs on it and what do you not realize that those two pillars are angels that are talked about in the book of genesis where when their time comes they're thousands of feet tall if you ever the spiri spirit realm you see uh that they're there they're waiting waiting for what well it talks about in the bible in the last days when one angel will put one foot in the middle of the ocean and in the middle of the land it says it very clearly and that's what one of those columns or pillars are sometimes those are angels and having been passed and out above the earth i can see the two angels standing there but i do need to give you a scripture that says jesus sits above the circle of the earth so let all of the flat earth be flushed down the toilet where it becomes because this is a world made by the hands of god handmade by him for the purpose of sending us from himself that we would come into this natural realm and have a physical body that we would keep with us through all eternity so basically that's it but these people who have nothing better to do obviously with their money or their life go looking for people who are hoping there's some other thing out there that they can prove exist and they have people pour millions of dollars into this flat earth society it just used to be the flat earth theory i guess when a bunch of people men got together and decided it was so important they'd actually name it a society so it'd have a name uh there literally are people some even well-known people uh or rich people who have become a part of this thing they could be made to feel special they're contributing to what they call is truth it's nothing but a distraction from satan these people should be winning the loss giving to the poor helping to build things or promote the kingdom or jesus christ himself by the way jesus laughs when they say that i just have to tell you every time in heaven they hear someone talking about their their meetings they have meetings usually not announced meetings trust me they they don't want the the general public to know they'd be coming and laughing at them but jesus laughs every time they hear the earth is really flat because you know the word made everything jesus made this earth he knows it's round it has a core a very core in it and it goes outward to the land it talks about the different levels of the earth uh that god made that he made and then he made the sky around it that's the first heavens then there's a second heaven which is just a higher a part of god the third heaven is where the throne room is is where heaven itself the world called heaven you can't see with your natural eyes because it's a spiritual world but there is absolutely no flat earth and i have to use this to explain just because i like to okay let's say here's the flat earth right and there's pilots going around this letter so i guess when they get to the edge they just flip it all over to the other side of the flat earth to get where they're going so uh i mean there are some things that are so ridiculous for people just to waste their time on so uh but the earth is round it is a world he sits above the circle of this earth and then there's another one that says the earth is footstool i think some of them like to say there's another proof see it's flat with a cushion on top of it they keep changing the shape of this flat earth it's almost hilarious yeah except that this sucks time and the life of people away which they could be doing better things well yeah i appreciate you doing that you know plus i i'm while you're talking i'm thinking i seem to remember that people that were sharp shooters like for the military they even have to use their scopes and use their settings on their rifles to to take into consideration the curvature of the earth where they won't be accurate and then of course you have pilots who who have to take in the curvature of the earth and all of their navigation they got a guide that's a full-time navigator if it's a bitcoin you know and yeah it's crazy what people will waste their time on but that way well one one more thing to throw in with all that because i mentioned it is nasa the national aeronautics space administration um we know what the all the stuff they put forward to just to have discoveries and any of you who don't realize all those missions we've sent into space or around the earth have produced so many products you're using right now systems ways to create things do things they have ways to test things that can't be tested anywhere else so this whole thing about exploring was something god put in us we want to know what's there what's out there they see the round earth all the time and they have to plan your right their trajectories have to be planned taking in the curvature of not just part of the earth but the whole earth uh also they're planned how long will they be out there how long will it take to go around the earth if they're going to go from there to the moon um and the flat earth people say they're lying they made it all up just to prove try to prove the earth is round and not flat it's like i guess when you get stuck in a ditch you're really in the ditch and can't get out i think some of them need help to get out of that ditch but the earth is not flat it is beautifully round heaven is a beautifully round sphere it's a sphere it is not a flat anything okay so don't worry about falling off the edge you're okay that's good all right let's see um uh okay here's pardon me i don't know how to pronounce her name i've been i've been a hairstylist i've been a hair stylist since i was 19. i'm very good at it and really enjoy it will i be able to do hair in heaven well that is a wonderful wonderful question and the answer is actually yes but heaven is on another whole level in every way the highest tech is in heaven it's not on the earth and the only reason people have more technology here or greater technology or levels of it is because those ideas come from heaven itself into the mind of man now those are great ideas okay god's ideas produce good satans produce stupid or distractions that's what they do so those ideas come from god but yes um one reason why you'll be able to do that when god made all of us when he made us and carried us inside of himself he put in you a gift it says every good and perfect gift comes down from the father of lights well when we lived in the father we were little spirits we were our spiritual body and we had light because we lived inside of him and uh so we were weren't just like little floaty things so we had a little spiritual body and we played inside of him and uh and then and we had light on the inside of us but each one of us were made special because of what he put in the passion to do something or be something well i can tell you if you can look at my hair i did not do this a salon operator who's highly skilled makes my hair look wonderful all the time and yes that is her gift and she loves to do it and she does it well athletes who are gifted are better than the ones who are just trained and have talent there's a difference in having a talent and being trained in something than being that gift and we know there's all kind of shows they want the most talented the most gifted uh they're all over the tv and on the internet and you know when that person has a gift the way they sing captivates you it just carries you places it's amazing artist there's a big difference in an artist and you can just kind of make something or you make something that people go wow that is amazing that's the person's gift and all kinds of people have gifts maybe not just to art or singing or even dance like ballet yes they have ballet that you don't wear choo-choos and stuff in heaven but you do get to use the gift that you are gardeners have a gift there are gardens that go from miles in heaven the most beautiful flowers but the flowers sing and change colors in heaven so you can imagine being a gardener tending things like that uh people who create beautiful things to wear in heaven they still they still do that in heaven now you have to understand in heaven there's nothing that's defiling revealing nothing that would be seductive in any way in your clothing but it's beautiful amazing it always feels good it looks good and there's all different styles of clothing that you can have in heaven because you know why those people have a gift even rodeos are in heaven why that is a gift people like the spectacular the exciting the adventurous awesome all of these are gifts and or or cooking wow you know uh cooking is called an art in heaven really really baking yes they have bakeries why because those bakers had a gift on earth if they never got to use it on earth when they get to heaven they'll have a whole bakery and everything they need to create delicious amazing things that they offer to everybody for free but that's why i know there are salons by the way i was actually taking the one and they have all kinds of i don't know gizmos and things to use but they use light to color your hair there's no chemicals there's no heat applied nothing like that and yes you can have your hair any color you want in heaven sometimes they apply diamond dust emerald dust um and then you go in the throat into the throne room and the glory of god reflects off of all the gemstones you're wearing or if it's in your hair it's not about making yourself be better than anybody there's no pride in heaven but the fun in advent even training pets that's a gift let me tell you i know people who can and who cannot do it uh don't take your pet to be trained by somebody who doesn't know what they're doing you probably won't like them when they get back but every kind of thing you know that goes on around you uh so there are architects in heaven there's designers there's event planners people have events all the time in heaven and there's some who do it to perfection and i can tell you when it's a gift it's like breathing you do it so easily they actually have event planners like like in a sense here you would hire them but there you wouldn't hire them but they'd agree to plan something right yes you schedule them to come and do an event for you in heaven maybe on your property you want to do something and there's everything amazing available no matter what type of event you want to have many people's mansions are big enough to hold hundreds of people their grounds are so massive they can hold thousands tens of thousands of people if they wanted to and and then there's places in heaven you could go to the valley of the falls or a passionate paradise you could go to the surf park and you don't have to pay to rent anything you use these beautiful places you just let that let them let them there are people who are in charge of that describes who who book your events for you and then you advertise by standing in the middle of your grounds and saying hello everybody i'm going to have this beautiful event it's going to be held at this place just show up whenever you can get there and they don't have days and weeks but they usually will announce that right at the time when it's ready they've done all the preparations it's all ready to go they'll announce and say just come when you when you're ready because we're going we're starting right now and so oh yeah it could be any kind of event fun events adventures uh hiking events in the mountain of spices um it's just it's just it's almost un unbelievable the beautiful things they have the exciting fun things but if you're an event planner can you imagine planning an event and the mountain of spices where the trees talk wow where the leaves it looks like fall all the time but the leaves are huge and there's purple and there's reds and these yellows and golds and there's beautiful places to hold events up there in the mountain spices you can go backpacking trail riding um while the horses are talking to you that you're riding on talking about where you're going you can do photo shoots yes they have cameras not made like ours and the unlimited mega pixels for all your photographers i love those mega pixels heaven is a glorious exciting amazing place and with all of that you get the presence of jesus christ the father and holy spirit and when it can't even number the angels that are in heaven they're everywhere some of them take care of the forest they take care of the flowers they take care of the waterfalls um but it's a beautiful place so yes if you're an event planter you got it made when you get to heaven make sure you know jesus christ are there are there some people that have how you said that some are so big that you can put hundreds of people in someone asked you what's the largest house or examples of some of the largest houses you've seen in heaven homes houses would um and and if someone has a massive mansion and someone has a less than mentioned as far as size um would they would they say can i use your mansion to hold my event because it'll hold hundreds of something like that does that kind of thing happen i think that is probably quite correct because everybody in heaven wants to serve one another uh you know it says to be the greatest of all you be the servant of all everybody wants to serve not just prove that they're greater it's the love it's the love it's the care that's there nobody's left out and oh i'm sure they would be pleased for you to come home in their mansion the biggest mansion i ever was shown in heaven belonged to an intercessor really the mansion was the size of new york city and that's because the intercession uh receive it caused that many rewards to come to this person through because of their intercession is that the is that kind of the point yes this person had prayed in four moves of god had prayed for people who hated them who pray they would pray and intercede um in such great authority because they made it a lifestyle and i know you're all probably picturing they're on their knees you know with a little altar in a closed dark room doing nothing but praying you know their life away it wasn't like that they lived a life of prayer no matter where they were they interceded all the time by speaking and declaring knowing that god would do these things because they they'd known them from a child but that was their reward and nobody nobody was upset that they had this reward because you know these people paid a price with their life the other place i've seen with some of the biggest mansions would be the martyrs the martyr side of heaven there's a whole area that's for the martyrs who really gave your life they were fantastic places that i saw there um wow did the people um the the this is the first time i realized that they're all in one place i've never heard that before or when you say they're all in one place is that literally if you died a martyr are you are you headed towards that place or how was it that god chose maybe can you give any more detail on that like i'm a martyr suddenly i died as a martyr i was killed during the course of serving the lord and um do i am i automatically going to martyr heaven for lack of a better word it's just a whole area where they're they're highly honored there people go there just to see uh they know most of the people you learn about people when you get to heaven if you didn't know much about them you will learn a lot about people's lives and the price they paid and what they gave sometimes um being a martyr means you it's not just like taking a bullet for somebody it's not just that it's that you lay down your life it talks about lengthy on your life for others laying down your life for others that because you care about them so maybe you you maybe you are taking on the brunt of something or or not necessarily a burden but a challenge that they would have had to take or would have had to do but but they didn't and you gave your life for doing that let's say mother teresa for example yes she's in heaven people why wouldn't she be she gave her an entire existence just to love people and help see them healed and she wasn't afraid to touch the sick or the lame i mean they came to her uh she poured herself and poured god into people uh that there'd be an area in it's just called they we know it's not called martyrs heaven people just know the people who gave their life literally gave their life were they have places there beautiful mansions like everyone has a mansion they have a gorgeous mansion but the grounds around that whole mansion would be very significant fantastic and amazing because of them giving their whole self for somebody for somebody for jesus christ and uh and everybody wants to go just to see now you still would have an area that would be yours near your families and he said to go to prepare a place he doesn't say you have to have one mansion by the way and he actually said that to me because on the grounds of this mansion in the martyrs area in this martyr's beautiful area there are doors on that mansion property when they step through that door they would be into the by the mansion that's near all of their family and they would walk through the door on that property come back to the other one the one that god gives them like part of the reward it's like instead of having a beautiful medallion or stuff like that giving them this and people want to go see your reward and so that's why that is that's why that's been established there and i'm not the only one who's seen it there's other people who've talked about the martyr part of heaven i i remember years and years ago rick joyner told of the experience of going to heaven he said some of the greatest monuments i'll use the word that i think he probably used but uh uh to another person were when he would see these massive monuments uh to praying mothers i mean a specific woman let's say my mother's name is frida let's say she was an intercessor she's she's still with us right now but you know if she's a praying mother i don't know how much of a prayer praying mother she was but if she was then that would be they would be a massive um memorial uh or something memorial was the writer memorial was the right one okay i actually was taken to two people's memorials and shown them uh one was dan crouches really really i saw a memorial i saw while it was still being built in heaven she hadn't passed yet and i saw it and it was the most it was so beautiful it was an area and there was this beautiful fountain that's why i said a memorial it's a whole park and it's and it's dedicated to jan's love for the children of the world this is actually says that on this uh and in gratefulness to jan's love for the children of the world because you know she did a lot for kids all over the world and gave herself for that and and there's this beautiful memorial fountain but there's a whole park that people can go in and do things especially kids and i don't know if you've heard me talk about the platform where kids go stand on a platform and a big bubble is formed around they float around heaven with their friends and all these bubbles well that's where i saw it was at jan's memorial wow it's a fun place kids in heaven can go and have a fun time but there's other things to do in this hope it's a park but the memorial actually itself is this massive fountain i i couldn't even tell you the square footage of it or the height of it but around the sides is like a child's face or figure from every nation around the world and when you walk past that part of the fountain it comes alive like the sculpture that sculpted into this mountain the child comes alive and it laughs it looks at you it's like living hearties and i walked all around the sun captivated i mean i saw children like from africa from india from uh from all the different places in the world where she would have food and gifts taken to them she did it her whole life and this walks her memorial it's got her name on it so and sometimes we would think of a monument it's just like an obelisk kind of a concrete thing right it's so much more than that uh some of them have parts of that included in there maybe things they did that would represent i've seen uh i went into another one where you went into this building and you you watched things it wasn't just like a a movie theater was great greater beyond that you walk past these things they've been created that was scenes from their life and you would actually watch them when they rescue people help people pray for them brought themselves you would see what they did it was recorded but it was like real life it was on my flat screen and i explained it was like no more than 3d dimension you literally were watching like you were there seeing what they did then you would step up and you would go to another one it was fantastic uh then another one um i saw that was uh like a pool this beautiful pool it went for forever and there was a crystal bridge and you'd walk across this critical crystal bridge and in this beautiful lake were like round open portals and it was sort of the same thing that you would look down in these pools of the portals i called them parts but the pools and from this crystal bridge you could see all the different acts of kindness or liberty liberating people maybe people in the military who liberated areas and things that they had talking about the plans and the things they did now there's no death or destruction shown in any things but you're not going to miss knowing what these people did with their lives on the earth yeah that's you and and cat how long does that go on i know there's no time in heaven but if if eternity is eternity are people going by these memorials for all eternity having seen i mean eventually you've walked by every memorial in heaven so i mean i think it would take a really really long time to to see uh some people have their favorite ones and sometimes they go there with the person whose memorial it is oh okay yeah they'll take you and go oh it's a whole different thing when you go through yourself and see or watch or or understand what they gave their lives you cannot escape being rewarded you're not gonna god's gonna make sure you don't miss the rewards there's rewards now in this life but the ones throughout eternity and and there's more than just a memorial there's places uh that have i know it talks about thrones around heaven all in heaven and there are people who sit on them sometimes they get to make some decisions or uh maybe people come by just to meet them it's not like they're ruling over heaven it's just a place of honor there's places of honor that maybe they're not there all the time but they have opportunities to sit there and people want to come to see him or something like that it's it's beyond your normal understanding but you're never going to be bored with anything that's there it's always going to be captivating exciting being not bored you've talked a number of times about that that you can actually be part of making a film you could people go to the theater and they can watch you at the theater if i'm you know you correct my language if i'm saying this right right or wrong but the people have written to me a number of times and says how is it possible for let's say make a john wayne movie with john wayne in there and some and people going what is there to do other than ride a horse um you know what i'm saying how does i i don't know how does a storyline get built into a movie in heaven with with zero gun shooting and all of that specific maybe maybe i'm saying it wrong but have you seen specific movies or parts of them we know even when they make movies down here they don't actually kill people right right that is true last time those guns they use here down here making movies uh people aren't probably really associated much with the producing but i've seen both sides of it and i understand the making of a movie and by the way that's why all those credits keep going by forever because all those people are parts of making this look good the special effects part you know the sound part the the film part the costumes i mean script people and screenwriters and it's more than that what you see on the film the few people you see in that film it took thousands to make that happen uh in heaven it's kind of the same way there's still things that make things happen now they're not going to show there's no movies with gore or people being murdered or stuff that doesn't exist but there are exciting intense fun different things to see in movies and yeah he could do a cattle drive stuff sort of like that take people and categorize for the first time and some of them are funny because you know john wayne had an actual funny side there's no no profanity it doesn't exist in heaven not even explaining or showing things there's no profanity so you're not going to see a lot of swearing or sexual things or witchcraft not at all no extreme no violence of any kind no one dying suffering or agony but you know why because they're highly gifted and it's good when they make things people want to go see these things made by people who know jesus christ john wayne accepted jesus christ that's really known in many places his daughter was there present when she received christ and it was while he was watching a show i think the crystal cathedral so stop knocking them people uh when they had a meeting there and led people to christ that was the time when john wayne in his own room not there yes and he was in a lot of pain at the time and um they said if possible get on your knees i know this all to be true and so his i don't know if his daughter helped him he said i'm getting on my knees he got off of his bed um and got on your knees and received jesus christ and saved yourself so the movie the movie group in heaven were the production people were really happy when john wayne showed up so there is there's like shooting and stuff and uh like things like that but there's no blood being splattered anywhere and there's not real bullets and um now i could tell you this when you go on hunts up in the mountain of spices the only way you shoot things is with the camera scope and you're taking the pictures going back to this big clubhouse they have there people are shaking their hands saying you're nuts well then you're saying heaven is nuts and you haven't been there so forget it hello so these things we enjoy on the earth there's just a different way they do it in heaven but it's just as exciting intense funny amazing captivating and as the father tells me all the time he said i would be in trouble if i have said you must come like a little child and there's not fun here so there's a lot of fun and exciting things to do in heaven and people have gifts on the earth that did stuff similar in heaven but it's so much more fantastic so that all ties back to the whole salon thing the reason why there will be is because god gifted people with that so he has to make a way for them to use that gift in heaven no matter whether it's a baker a painter a designer a director an events planner those those rodeos i mean amusement parks people have to have gifts to create those things the only thing not in them is evil wickedness darkness but that doesn't mean you're not going to have a good time i never cared for the dark stuff yeah awesome um speaking of fun now this because i don't know if the dinosaurs lived at the same time that adam and eve did or not but it says did adam name the dinosaurs were there dinosaurs on the ark well probably not in the ark right i i think the alligator may be the only remnant left of them and they they kind of look like one but in the much smaller scale i mean really kind of similar they were like they were on the earth when he made it the first time which is another whole show when it says in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth okay uh there's a time when he made the earth that mankind was not on the earth yet he made it it was beautiful there was no sun to light it it was lit by his glory and there's a scripture i think in jeremiah that talks about when god turned the light out um and then there was darkness upon the deep so between verses one and two are millions of years if you're not in that group you'll get over it when you get to heaven and find out but when the dinosaurs were made when he first made the earth i was taken back i saw it it was uh the sky was like a peachy pink um and there was this water vapor shield that he put around the original earth uh it's still the same landmass by the way and it was round back then not flat how about that so when he made the earth the first time he made it um and there was no storms there was no raining on the earth so we had to have a way to water these hundred foot high flowers that i saw there they had forest of flowers a small dinosaur could actually go stand under one if they wanted to uh none of the dinosaurs ate flesh at when they first made they ate the vegetation they ate the seeds they eat the fruit that's what he gave them to eat when he first made them they weren't wild they weren't them you know harmful that happened when satan was cast out of heaven uh but when he made the earth there was time it was beautiful it was such peace he put watcher angels who have flesh on them on the earth to care for the dinosaurs and they would talk to them dinosaurs talk after them and so that was during that time uh when he flooded the earth with water the first time this was before noah's ark and it clearly says in verse two that there was darkness upon the face of the deep right that was the water and this in the spirit hovered over it and god was about to remake the earth that so before that time was when the dinosaurs existed uh there were no cro-magnon men there was no cavemen at that time it was just god's creatures and the water angels on this beautiful earth which you will get to see when you get to heaven by the way you see all of it happening uh and then when he began when he decided okay satan's trying to destroy the earth and mess it up because he he is actually the one who made the dinosaurs bad well they began to eat each other and redestruction on the earth and satan began to make it a wilderness which it says in the bible it says he began to make the earth a wilderness it says that this is the original earth and was causing destruction on the earth that's why god took the light away it says he turned the light out he took his glory off the earth that brought the darkness and then he began uh to break the water vapor shield that had twice as much water in it that brought a mist down so the mist used to come from there and from the earth itself and that's how the flowers got the water and the dinosaurs hide was i can tell you this you can't take a dinosaur and stick them in the desert but they have found their their bones in the desert because that part used to have ocean in it you can't take a hide this thick and not keep water on even alligators crocodiles have to stay in the water most of the time they come out in the sun for a while but if they got trapped out of the water that high would eventually crack and fall apart so there's all kinds of evidence around us that something existed before our time and people try to make it something else god made the earth the first time lit it with his glory made this whole system with his water vapor shield and then he put two handfuls of water on it another water vapor shield and it was like being in an atrium and his glory lift that whole earth so with the mist coming and the light of the glory it made the sky not blue they even need oxygen at that time because this was before the fall this is before the fault happened and things were just different run different in verse two there's destruction that's happened on the earth there's even water on the sky it says you remove the water off the permanent the firmament is the sky so all these in verse two all this stuff has happened he didn't make it that way and then it says clearly he began to replenish the earth in other words he was putting it back together removing all the excess water off of it drying it out where it need to be dried out and then he began to replenish the earth with the with the creatures with the birds and all that stuff and then of course we know on the sixth day he decided to make man so there's you a little bit of a big picture that happened so the gun way back when um the the watcher angels were the ones who cared for them and were on the earth with them so i do not believe there were actual dinosaur dinosaurs i know they show the loch ness monster in scotland we were there i didn't see them by the way yeah because we were there too they paint the on the boat that you take the tour at loch ness and then you got a picture of the dinos what is it the monster on the glass messy yeah that's what it was and then you see i was taking pictures of the glass um okay two more quick questions to wrap up uh do our angels my apologies do our angels know our destiny i think most assuredly your guardian angels know what your destiny is because they try to keep you on track yeah they do more than just standing with a sword you know trying to kill anything comes by you they they they give up they will say things to you that will either um help heal your soul or maybe inspire your soul they'll give you thoughts that lead you towards christ they'll give you thoughts of ways to fix things uh they probably help people the people who are going to be like creators of inventions i'm sure that they help them even in that by saying things to them that would help them do their inventions and stuff like that they i do know this they're sent at the time of conception when you are conceived in your mother's room your guardian angels are sent then and i will see them walking around pregnant women and they're waiting on the baby to be born so guess what uh just so the left nose there were witnesses to what you did to those babies and no one in heaven is happy about it i just had to add that for free but your guardian angel is sent at the time of conception you are something already when he takes that little spirit of life from himself and he gets knitted and attached to that dot of flesh that is your spirit man man cannot make the spirit we can't make the spirit okay that has to come from god and so at the time of conception that's when he sends that little spirit of life it talks about in the bible when he blew into adam's nostrils he takes that and attaches it in the mother's womb your guardian angels are sent right then everybody has more than one because one has to take a break and go back to heaven and come back it says that your angel always is before the face of god that means one or the other is up there talking about you maybe things you need help with and maybe things you need to know about they're getting some instructions from the father to come back but you always have one with you all the time when you die and step out of this body your spirit man steps out the first thing you will see will be your own guardian angel waiting to help escort you to heaven nice but i'll be fine that'll be fun okay last question are there creatures from earth that don't exist in heaven we know and that this person wrote we know it's the opposite is true that there are things on heaven that are not on earth are there things on the earth creatures that are not in heaven i think it wouldn't be the creatures i think it would be insects oh yeah well it would be impacting just me yeah i've seen every kind of creature that i have seen physically on this earth they are in heaven they're in heaven they're different in heaven they have a real life in heaven uh every creature can communicate or talk to any of the people who are in heaven um they are not eaten in heaven i might as well add that nobody goes and shoots or kills these creatures who have a real life uh god towed noah put every creature on the ark that has a spirit of life in them that's a spiritual body with the soul in it but those on the ark okay those are the ones you put on the ark and there's a reason for that so so when creatures die they go to heaven and often quite all of your pets go to heaven every one of your pets that passed away your own guardian angel escorts your pet i'll talk about the past escort your pet to heaven but every kind of thing i've seen literally that exists right now on the earth the creatures i've seen um some of them in heaven so but i've seen creatures in heaven that were never on the earth i think that's the mystery part that's some of the wonders that you get to see in heaven the things that you never saw on this earth that exist in heaven he has a lot more there than what he put he put some of them on the earth some of them you never put on the earth yeah awesome well cat tell people about revealing heaven.com what can they get there well they can get get my my books my products revealingheaven.com is where my my company operates and sells the product sets up the events and that type of thing happens there i think you can see some testimonies on that and then um so that's where you go to do that type of thing i think i have a copy of my book somewhere i was just going to show my book and now i don't know yeah there's a great book i've read the books and they're really really good i hope people yeah so i have one here i was just going to show it to everybody here is the book right here it's called revealing heaven and you see the wing with some of the eyes in it and the holy spirit makes me laugh all the time he said when you put the wing of the living creature on the book make sure half's on the front half's on the back some people won't like your book in the bookstore they'll turn it around well if they turn it around they wouldn't see more of them and they'll see me with my pink hair that was their plan not mine and so this is book one right here i've got book one book two totally different uh stories and encounters in both of those books different places in heaven and i'll just show some people there are illustrations in this book um this would be one of the nursery walls in heaven where little babies have these beautiful little things they sleep and they don't have like a hard bed uh beautiful like a big seashells with glorious fabrics on it birds flying and take them for rides roses and flowers grow out of the wall that sing to these babies the angels will take them and hold them and rock them and sing to them and as i've said before babies grow so very slow that they're still young when you go to heaven later and so there's there's all kinds of illustrations in this book one day we'll make a coffee table book with them all in color here's one of uh two guardian angels taking the person home that they watch and uh so the guardian angels look mostly like people with wings your guardian angels are different than the army most of the army are creature-like looking things with like eight eyes and stuff like that that's so they can see the enemy that would be satan and the dark army in the front or the back they have eyes on the back of the head this is a transport and uh there's no steps attached to anything she walks on steps floating in air she was in her 90s when she passed away her nickname was mrs matt and these are her guardian angels who escorting her home to heaven so this book has illustrations of heaven in it and uh but a lot of a powerful evidence that heaven is real so you would get that one or book two we have audio books we now have them on uh digital i think like on flash drives or downloadable we have got so many revelations now we still we do still sell cds and dvds and i've been told to let them go but there's still people out there buying them and they don't do digital stuff on the computer yet so we want everyone to have a chance to have it but there's all kinds of revelations on the cds dvds some of them are um have some instructional stuff on it and one thing we'll be adding is a lullaby i have an amazing highly gifted person who went to the boston conservatory of music who sings opera and we will be making some cds together or even maybe dvds where you'll actually hear this beautiful singing songs about heaven and then i will be prophesying or declaring over your babies over your children is something that we will do next year this year sorry this year sometime this year maybe close to the close of the end we'll have all kinds of music available eventually that sings about heaven but so this will be added but we have so much revelation i all will help you find out about when the earth began what that was like the ancient past we have um i'm trying to remember the name now we have copycat which shows about everything that satan has stolen images and things that he stole from god and perverts them on the earth and then we have all kinds of things like the kingdom age we have um uh i can't remember all the titles marked which is for young people and it's showing a young person with tattoos on their arms or remarks of god and talks about what he's going to do with that generation in these days coming up i release that at a a youth thing with 3 000 youth in it and then released the lightning power of god into every single one of them it was one of the most powerful meanings i had so a lot of these are events that took place since the anointing and the glory are on them and you can just so go go to to regainingheaven.com and see we also do things like i've always showed this cup i don't right here and we try to produce things that represent heaven or speak against our enemy which would be the devil and so there's a lot going on there and then i also have oh we even have these simple little things like um this is we have these little tent cards and this is the thing you declare about getting grace for abundant life oh god and on this side is the prayer the declaration you make over your loved ones who are not saved this is what he said this is what he said to tell them to declare and so these don't cost almost nothing i think and you can add it to any any kind of order i'm just going to read what it says father i declare that all of my family my friends and those that i love will become mighty children of god they will be free in jesus name they will not miss their destiny they will become the living testimony of the saving power of jesus christ amen and that is what uh they have me bring back to the earth to tell people you declare that over your family members and they were they father so he gave me the exact prayer decree to me and then he promised you you do this and i'll do that right exactly and he's very serious because you know even jesus did that the famous prayer all right our father who is in heaven holy is your name that whole thing came from jesus christ this is from jesus christ and the father if you don't know how to pray for them you don't have to tell god how bad and wicked they are by the way he knows that and i want to add one more you're making a stand this is important if you're making a stand for someone in your family or people who are like family to know christ don't make the declaration then turn around and tell everybody how bad and wicked they are not all the time in other words if you're giving a testimony to somebody that's different but i'm just saying you can't be double-minded this is your mind set on a of course for your family ones or loved ones to know jesus okay hold it up right there but if you just ask for the declaration card it's on uh when you go to order something you can always add this you can send it to other people so they'll know about it so we want to help people get into heaven and this is just a good way to do it and and you know the word says i got to add one more thing the word says it's appointed under man to die wants to die and then the judgment i want to assure you that word judgment does not talk about the great white throne judgment it is not talking about the judgment seat of christ it's when you die there is a judgment made is there someone out there standing for them can christ use the keys to hell death in the grave to do something about your declaration because he will and that's why it says it's appointed unto me and wants to die and then the judgment okay that's right when you die there's a judgment made had these people ever declared have they ever asked jesus christ into their heart is there someone standing for them to make that happen to give time for that to happen and this was adamant jesus christ was adamant about telling you about this so there is ways and jesus said to me some people will be shocked to see who made it but it was because they made a stand and didn't get off of that stand they kept that stand stand there for and don't change what you're saying about your family members or your friends and then there's catker.com where you get all kinds of revelation training um powerful things and it is the only way that you can give to me online is to go to catcure.com click on the treasury and yes you can become a guardian we have the guardian zone that's all those who give to us we just sent out all of our letters to people we sending out the gifts that we have purchased for them for the guardian zone and i want to say like steve we can't do this without people giving you help make it happen and i want to say this you get the same reward we do when you support us on a continuation you get the same reward we do for doing these things that is a surety so thank you for all those who give make sure you do give to the elijah list because you wouldn't be hearing the prophets right now those who are speaking truth the truth makes you free not just not man's mindset not means assumptions not man's plans not threats of the enemy but the truth makes you free and steve helps to make that happen by giving the the microphone to the prophecy gives us the platform so you can know about god know about jesus know about holy spirit know about heaven know what god is doing right now and so i am grateful and i thank the father bring the healing power over steve over doreen in jesus name because i'm bringing him to remembrance of all that he has done father all that he has done that you have asked him to do even to his own hurt he has not stopped putting forth the true word of god and let the prophets be heard who are telling the truth that he knows and i thank you god for setting steve in the place you have given and the authority you have given him and i pray that every demon flee from him when he goes into a place that they shake and tremble in fear when he wakes up in the morning and feels the presence of the living god and gives voice to those who speak for him and won't hold back amen amen wow i'm very very you're very kind to speak to to bless us thank you thank you thank you thank you i guess i'm supposed to want me to ask this um ask ask kat about where where people can attend her next

hey happy wednesday february 9 2022 welcome to the broadcast uh by the way jeff in case we didn't talk about this uh or in case we weren't ready to be sure to get that video ready we're going to run that in a minute so i wanted to tell you about the um the wells that we are digging that you are digging um it's all paid for by you our viewers and we're now doing three wells a month in uganda so we're going to show you uh two things we're going to show you a brand new video about the wells that are being dug and then at the end of the video we're going to show you a map of where these wells um are it's amazing amazing amazing so this is just to remind people that we're in partnership with show mercy you can find them at showmercy.org just like it sounds mike and laurie sally uh they are the ones um with the village called field of dreams in uganda and then we're partnering with them to get these wells drilled so it's a it's a twofer we're both doing it together and you'll see the sign where it talks about elijah's streams and show mercy so without further ado let's play that video jeff [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] hello [Music] wow is that not amazing you all did this the reward goes to you you're the one that sends in the money we take your uh income and we we take what you send in we spend uh ten thousand dollars per well i think we're on well let's look at the map if you can put that map up i think it's ten all the blues are wells that are finished now and if it was bigger i'd read the names of these villages every single one of those is in a different village and then the yellows are the next three uh wells i believe though the yellows are the february wells that we're digging and we plan to keep going we're going to do three wells a month all year long and don't expect us to stop because we're on a roll uh the the people mike and laurie have expressed that that there's so much more favor they have in this whole region in the community people now know that elijah's dreams and show mercy field of dreams are doing are doing this and so now they're very very open the gospel is being shared each of the wells are prayed over and anointed and as they're finished pastor fred i think is his name is helping get this done so uh he's one of the the the native peoples i'm not sure what you'd say though the local um people and he's the pastor there and he's helping mike and laura get this done but bless you bless you bless you i think at the end of every one of our videos or every one of our streams there's a way to donate there's a link uh we put the link on the chat and we put the link in below youtube we try to put it different places so you can donate or mail a check we appreciate that so much it not only helps us keep this program going but you can see where this is going and i think like i said i think we're at well 10 now it's something like that i'm losing track because it's an odd number because we started with only one and then we started doing two a month and now we're doing three a month we will very likely increase the number of wells rather than decrease it so we'll see what god does but isn't that amazing thank you all for what you're doing for thank you for generosity on behalf of the lord you know the lord you saw that scripture you even if you give so much as a cup of cold water to one of these you will not lose your reward if you sent money in knowing that a good deal of art we tithe out of that and the tithe a significant portion of the tithe we get out of elijah's streams goes right to these wells too and then the gospel is shared so just wanted to really uh thank you thank you thank you all for doing that so all right well without further ado let's bring kat in here hey did you see all of our wells there did you see that i did that is amazing i'm telling you that so blessed is the heart of god i know it's helping the people but it really is part of what the father wants us to do he wants us to reach out to be kind to care which um obviously the left cares for nothing but we do we have to we we follow jesus christ and you know he helped he fed the people everywhere he went he would they did he would give them water and so that is just a normal thing to do as a believer is to reach out and help people so i am really um excited about what y'all are it's just you know i just haven't had this much fun years and people might have heard me say it was 1987 where god spoke to me in the middle of night and he said well ministries and then he said little orphan children now they're not all orphans but they're all children yeah and um it's in and then finally so whatever that was 30 some years and then we finally got to obey the word of the lord but maybe i should have started before that but uh and when i had that word we were pretty darn poor i was just telling my step about yeah i think he was just talking about the future steve what you know you're part of the prophetic that's what happens he'll say something to you it could be 10 20 30. there's things he showed me 45 years ago that we're just not stepping into but i knew it would always happen it's like i never stopped believing like you there's no way it could happen back then anyway we were trying to just eat back then in those days you know growing up but you know what even trying to eat ourselves we still shared with other people and uh we were always continually getting blessed we we had basic stuff probably but we were so happy that we loved helping people and we would take even in the 60s when the there were all the flop houses where the the young people would gather to take drugs my dad would take big pots of stew and soon and they'd always let you come if you're going to feed him then he'd cheer jesus and some of those very people turned up to be revivalists and evangelists in these days wow so you never know like what you're helping the ones you're helping there you never know what they're or who they're going to become for god so you're seating in the lives of future leaders probably in the world right now that's just so amazing we had another place in uganda that did contact us and we're looking at that as a as a secondary place to to drill wells so um god's really got our our focus on these wells um you know it's just so amazing because you see every single well and uh lori wrote to me the other day and she said already through these wells that you saw on that map thousands of people are using that one and a thousand she said so it's just you can tell i'm excited about it you can really tell that i'm too because you know growing up with my dad who he was sir he touched probably probably hundreds of thousands of people in his lifetime dropping them and i mean we would we would really help people that were abandoned or or something and we would work with them sometimes a couple of years getting them a place getting them clothes i mean we would give our own stuff away even though we didn't have and we i actually still carry that on now in my own life if people need something sometimes my husband have to get used to i say go get us go find a truck get a rental truck and we take our almost a half a household of our furniture somebody who had none and we didn't give them the old beat up stuff we gave them the brand new stuff and i my heart would just be so excited and so happy that we got to make a difference so i i understand what that is like it truly is truly truly is more blessed to give than receive it's like they're enjoying that so much and we're enjoying it a whole lot more if it can be possible so well kathleen you know we're in amazing times this even seems like an amazing month amazing week amazing day and what what's on your heart to share about current events before we get into questions every day things are changing and i'm telling you no matter what you're hearing in other news sources it's all downhill for the left i just have to say the truth you know i'm always going to tell the truth besides what the father son and holy spirit are sharing with me personally that they showed me months and months ago is happening right now they're not going to tell you uh who is who is coming forward to be witnesses they're not going to give a lot of that out until the hammer really falls on all of them but i can tell you the foundation is totally getting into crumbles right now and every time this is a sign you can tell when they start adding insane things i'm talking about the laugh and they start adding insane things on their list of to do uh you know they're desperate because you know why they're adding new stuff that is dangerous or that is criminal activity the other stuff is not working yeah no hell cannot create anything good it just gets worse and worse that's what happens when you give yourself into the darkness it only gets worse and worse people there's never going to be any better or good in any of that uh evil is not good okay yeah it is bad and this is the worst thing you could be involved in but more and more people are standing up the everyday um citizen not just in america but even canada as you well know yeah people are watching those truckers and uh we did have something very significant happened since our last broadcast that you all know about the caravan the convoy that has gone across to the country of canada well god says north american continent that has gone uh from there it's header thing to ottawa or or way over to the from going from the west to the east area in canada and uh there's tens of thousands of truckers people in case they're lying to you about it i know they've heard from their um their leader uh who's never going to tell you the truth either you know not even in canada their leader is not going to tell the truth and they've been putting up with him for a long time because i know i have a lot of friends in canada and they've always been not just complaining but fed up with the illegal regulations and laws he's been making and uh so this convoy really was quite a shock to him he didn't expect this backlash against all of his stuff that he's saying people tend to want to be free and they're fed up with what's going on and so this convoy started with just a few hundred trucks i i forgot close to like fifty thousand that sounds like insane right but that is really what's going on and they've gone across all of canada and people are coming out by the dozens if not hundreds in some places to feed these truckers i mean wherever they stop like for the night or if they take a break people are there with food with supplies bringing gas and i mean it's just craziness to see what a good crazy uh to see how these people are pulling together because they know these truckers are not just there representing them they're representing the people in canada and the people are with them because they know this is for their good well the the t person their leader that i don't know what's gone wrong with his brain either he made a decision i'm going to do something this is just got to stop it's got to stop so he contacted all these big industries that had this massive um like commercial grade tractors when i say tractor on commercial grade tractors he was going to send them all to this line of this big convoy and begin to bust it up and break it up because when people get united it is very dangerous [Laughter] you didn't like this whole picture because you know people have they have their cell phones and they can't hide the truth of being shown and of what's really going on they're making a stand for their freedom and so he decided i'll stop this right now and i forgot how many hundreds of these huge massive tractors he contacted these commercial farmers said you will go there you will bust this thing up and end it and so all these massive tractors came up alongside where the convoy was and instead of making them get out and and stop or either take their stuff or make them move they got out and stood alongside them and said we are together with you that is freaking out their leader now what is he gonna do now right uh they're saying we're making a stand too we want to be free too so we're not forcing them to end this we're a part of it [Laughter] oh man isn't it fun watching people get united you know and when you get united against egypt you know what this i know was a god thing because let me tell you there are praying people in canada yeah i was told a long time ago don't go there it's dark when i'm sorry everywhere i went i saw light light in the people light and regions there uh they've had some very important people just come from the area and bring the truth many many places in america too uh but they're making a stand and when it only takes one or two people to finally stand and say we're not having this anymore we're doing something about it we're going to let them know we're not afraid of them we're making a stand we are going to be free and and now that stand is just increased because instead of sending someone against them to stop it they are joining them knowing from the very moment that they got that called this is what you will do oh they went there but they're not making them stop so i'm celebrating all of you uh farmers and people in canada who came alongside the the they their people there to bring freedom to all them i congratulate you and celebrate awesome and you know i'm hearing that this is about to um be released the truckers in the united states i understand that this is just a rumor but the rumor is on super bowl sunday which is this sunday that after the super bowl the truckers are going to start from in l.a heading back east so if that's true we're about to witness uh probably what canada is doing even in an increase even more so um because the the population is greater in the united states so they can do more so and you're right they are really trying they're they're trying their best not to interrupt you but i'm so excited they're trying to keep as much as possible undercover you know so you know the left knows as little as possible about what their plans are and let me tell you they've learned how to communicate with each other really well it will be massive that's all i can say it will be mind-blowing to see how many of them and i do know this along the way which you're going to figure that anyway more will be added but to think from if from california to dc you're going to see this american convoy and this is the greatest part other uh nationalities in this country are also involved in this trucking convoy it isn't just you know we the white people in america yes we the black people the hispanic people you know the ones from india whoever wherever they are that they want freedom are already and they have had time the american ones have had time to super plan ahead of time the feeding stations the places where they'll get their fuel um they may even stop and and have bull horns and say some stuff i know even people are getting ready to stand along the is like they did in canada and probably a line hold streets in cities so you know they're going to show them what they think about our fake leadership in dc they're going to show them what they think they're done with it we are done with that and we know that whole thing is crumbling even though if they won't tell that truth one day it will it will be told and it will have to be told on the news there will be no other no other choice for them to do that the freedom has already begun and i know god had said watch the first three months of this year yeah and you'll see great things happening that will begin to bring hope and joy not just hope but joy into your heart so uh keep the celebration going and now you can visibly see things happening that there's no way you can hide okay you can't hide a hundred thousand two hundred thousand people's activities going across these different areas in canada and in america so you can see what has started there is now coming down here in our country and uh so this is this is our stand for freedom people so make sure you're praying for all of them pray for every one of them protection uh of course provision and supply it will bring hope and joy into the hearts of everyone who is there as it passes you know as it passes by if they come to your city make sure you get out there in the streets and let them know that you're standing with them and thank them for their for their own stand totally totally you know it's kind of fun but i think it was the late 70s they had that famous song about the trucker convoy that's when cb radios took off and they had this famous song and then that star goes folks i think we got ourselves a convoy breaker breaker one nine right or something like that and and i heard that in canada i don't know if they tried to shut off the the cell phones or whatever but of course truckers use cb radios anyway but but other people were buying were going out and buying cd radios so they could communicate with the truckers without the need without the need for the cell phones because you just as long as you're in range you can talk to any of the truckers all at the same time back in the day when my husband's parents lived in ohio um my husband actually got one one of those radios as we go up the west virginia turnpike uh you could talk to anybody any of the truckers if you needed help they needed help you heard them have conversation all the way up day or night and so that's what he's talking about they have their own antennas that they operate from they don't need to sell power they don't need a uh they don't need a networks to be involved right right you can't stop those conversations people i know people that have them in their homes and just for fun with having to talk to all the truckers yeah if you got one drag it out and clean it up yeah to come out and say hello as the college age which i was at that time you would be bizarre if you didn't have a cd radio in your car it was that big of a deal you know and yeah you'd learn to use it and people get on your case if you didn't say your call signs or your handle or whatever yes see so they were doing that people long before the cell phones came along yeah we didn't have that yet people had a way to communicate didn't they stephen now they're going down it was fun those were fun days so i don't know whatever happened i guess i sold it with the car but well let's see i guess we'll get into some questions about heaven and heaven related things so for anyone that's new cat's been to heaven uh literally thousands of times over the last 20 30 years um is that about right am i saying that right it's past 20 years so you know after a while you kind of lose count but um yeah it has been over 20 years since um and by the way if jesus came in person everybody came in person and told me uh the father and his plans about taking me to heaven to reveal heaven to earth like never before so you know the truth about it he said it would dispel the fear of death uh and that has totally done that with so many people but it would also let you know for you there and uh it is my great pleasure uh to step out in obedience to the father i didn't ask and i always say this this was not my plan and i never asked for it i just always gave the father what he wanted i would obey as much as i possibly could whatever he asked me to do in the small things so don't despise the small things people he trained me by saying you'll fly to this airport and and when you go into the concourse where the food station is you will give this person dressed like this this message from me and i had to just go i mean i flew uh one time to minneapolis to the airport there and i had this very important message it was just grab on a little piece of paper said i'll give you the message when you get on the plane this is stepping in faith okay i did it in faith yes i paid for it out of my own pocket and when i got to the full court there was the guy dressed exactly like he said in a blue mechanic's uh outfit and uh he said when he bows his head to pray over his food you will run up and say this is god's answer and then you have to turn around and leave wow so i wrote his answer on this piece of paper it was about some new invention and he was telling him yes he was going in the right direction with it was so profound but i didn't really understand that uh and i had to race to catch my plane back i flew gave the message so when he asks you to do things like that that makes no sense to your natural mind god doesn't ever have to make sense he's god and things he's doing right now that you don't understand or see it might not make sense to you but he has a reason for doing things you just have to follow and do what he asked so that's how he trained me to do these things to hear him uh exactly and distinctly and then he would start catching me up to heaven and showing me places and i have a photographic memory so when i tell you this is what i saw it's what i saw if i told you this is what i heard it's what i heard if i if i helped felt amazing emotions or i smelled aromas or tasted the food that's exactly what happened to me so you're getting an eyewitness not just an assumed report this is not an assume report this is eyewitness accounts uh excuse me give me get a drink yeah go for the dream ivanis accounts on purpose planned by the father son and holy spirit to reveal their home the father's house is a world called heaven it is not just a building and he's preparing a place for you that you can be there with him if you're born again believer if you don't know jesus you better get on that train because it's the only way there yeah wow okay well wow wow wow cat all right let's jump into some questions now a lot of the questions related to heaven or heaven related stuff like you said pets god takes your pets to heaven which i love we just had to put our kitty down last week or the week before but kat because you had told us about that our pets go to heaven because you had described what happens because you had said you're doing them a favor when they're really sick and they're in pain and this kitty was in terrible pain and his kidneys shut down suddenly you know we just knew we had done this kitty a favor and it's a little bit hard even so but still you know you just ushered them into the presence of the lord what is the cat what is that animal's experience i don't even know how to even ask that question or if you would even know how to answer it what is it what does an animal experience when they suddenly do you know has the lord ever showed me anything like that what they experienced actually uh quite a few times has happened since we have always had a lot of pets and right now of course we rescue cats we have cats everywhere yeah but um ma we used to have yorkies um one while i was married this is like over the last 20 years we've had yorkies my mom had one i had one um they think they're people they don't know their dogs and uh and we love them very much but eventually they get very old and you know i had kept mine beyond the time they had appointed times they were supposed to leave leave for heaven and i kept mine and kept saying no you're going to stay and not go and the poor little dog got like blind and weak and already moved and finally my family come they said we don't think she'll last you get back and god said i'll let her last but you're gonna let her go and so uh so um i did i said well i promise that if you let last time get back and say goodbye then i will release her to you and it did happen when they when they pass just like we do their spiritual body that looks just like them steps out of their fleshy body i firmly believe that on the day the dead in christ will rise they will give their bodies back to you because they are living in heaven your own guardian angel my own guardian angel took my yorkie to heaven and when she stepped out of that that physical body and she had stopped breathing there she was and my angel just grabbed her up and took her up to heaven i have seen her in heaven several times when i was there just enjoying herself playing and games and stuff with other pets that are up there but they experience uh more more so i think for them it's easy they don't in their head have to figure out what just happened to me they know they're not hurt they're not sick you know they're not and they're not infirmed anymore they can run jump and play because they also look younger if they were if you're if your pet was really well i never thought of it that way yeah it's just like us when you could be 99 when you pass but you look like you're in your 20s you're like 20s when you step out of this physical body i literally have been with people when they passed and i knew it was them stepping out of their body and their angels waiting would reach their hand out if you had loved ones that you were with and they were about to pass and they reached out that was probably to take their angel's hand that was going to be escorting them back to heaven but the same thing with the pets except that your own angel takes your pet up to heaven to your mansion that's being built and they know that's their home now they know that's their new home and if you had other pets go they're gonna be with those other pets enjoying yourself so they're happy and i think the most amazing time uh that i experienced all this was my mom's little yorkie who jen and i took he couldn't hardly move or breathe anymore and my mom of course was like i don't think i can take when jenna and i go we'll take him so we took him to our our family vet and took him in and we stayed with him the whole time and they gave them just a real simple shot so he kind of went to sleep and eventually he passed and he jumped out of his body yeah you could see it because you're a seer you actually watched it happen you actually watched it happen yes and then and then when i saw that i turned again and i said that the father said run outside and he said get your camera ready run outside so i ran outside the vet and we have a photograph of that dog's spiritual body heading towards heaven it is so him he had the point his ears you know yorkie you fixed the ears of the stand up he had really high pointy ears and he was really quite cute and it was a spiritual body look just like him but younger and i got pictures to come back and say look mom he's on his way home to heaven and she was still rejoicing we will be doing i'm just going to leak it out right now don't ask us when it'll be done we will be doing because i know all of my stuff is going to say why'd you do that because i'm going to give you all hope and joy our next calendar will be about pets good good good pets in heaven pets in the clouds that we've gotten pictures of pictures of our own pets it will make everyone rejoice god said it'd be one of the most favorite calendars we ever make there'll be a little story with it but you'll see either picture of them in the sky literally in the spiritual body and that that that dog's picture will be in the calendar when we make it so god is adamant about letting you know your pets go to heaven so i've already just broken the hidden thing now that's good okay so it's going to be so much fun making that calendar with so many memories yeah i want one i want one my artist is going to do a rendering of my dad walking along part of his ranch with all of our pets from the time we were growing little walking behind him on his property that will be one of the scenes in the calendar so have you is that an actual scene you've seen in him i saw in heaven i actually saw that scene in heaven uh uh he god caught me up to my father's ranch my dad didn't see me or even talk to me but i saw him i could identify the pets i had when i was a little girl and i tell the story when we lived in new york we weren't allowed to have pets where we live but they had resident mice there we made friends with the residents and we taught them how to jump off the curtain rod onto our shoulders these little tiny mice i saw them in heaven writing on the back of another one of our pets that we had so it could be a really cute story that goes with that but that was an actual eyewitness account i saw my brothers uh i go on the iggy i saw my brother's alligator you hear me talk about all the time charlie was in this long line of pets so god was showing me yes i mean it when they go to heaven so i have seen all of these pets plus uh the couple other uh encounters i had but but i have amazing photographs that we took and let me tell you every time we take them to officemax to get printed the people freak out because they know we didn't generate that i'm doing good to use my cell phone i don't know how to make anything online uh so i don't get to see most messages and stuff like that and like that's why i have tech people yeah but none of these photographs that we put in the calendar will be doctored up in any way they'll be the real deal and quite surprised and delighted so your pets are enjoying themselves awesome okay well along that line uh about uh paul is asking he said we had to put my dog down a week after my 21st birthday since then i've been having dreams regularly where he is with me and is not dead is the lord possibly allowing him to visit me interesting question either that or he's just catching you up while you're sleeping oh wow that's even better that has actually happened many times to people usually within maybe the first year or two of someone a pet passing they have actually been caught up to certain like there's this field they are taken to or someplace by the crystal sea sometimes they're walking with their with their pet on the beach of the crystal sea uh but a lot of them are in this beautiful meadow there's meadows there it's near butterfly field which is an actual place in heaven where all the butterflies will fly and attach themselves and they'll sing nice in heaven this isn't heaven i'm talking about um but you know i don't i don't know myself of them but i'm not saying they couldn't appear i'm not saying i know they can't come back and live i just want to clarify that well i mean even i'm not going to come back from heaven and live with you okay number one they wouldn't want to leave heaven yeah well it's even a better to me uh um it's even a bad that is what you're saying right uh well you broke up when you just said that so okay so when when he dreams that the the animals visiting him and he's alive and it feels real you're saying he might be being caught up himself to visit his animal yes absolutely wow okay all right next question can your grandchild's guardian angel and the holy spirit oh can you ask your grandchild's guardian angel and the holy spirit to help keep her or him in the knowledge of what their purpose is in life while they're still in the womb and as they grow up so there's i guess there's can you ask the holy spirit and their angel to do things like that make them walk the straight path i guess i don't know well i don't know what they mean how far along they're growing up because eventually everybody does have to make a choice yeah but absolutely um i would say like my grandchildren are being trained by their parents my my my children my son-in-law my daughter um i had three girls and they're training them how to hear holy spirit okay and some of them actually have seen their guardian angels and um so they're they're they're they're called to be in ministry in some form or shape of ministry or to be out there to be known and seeing they are and so that's something put in their heart now god will put it in their heart it may not be visible or known at the time some come out um as soon as they start speaking they might start saying things about god i'm just saying get ready for these generations of children being born now to do that more so than in the past uh but i'm pretty sure the angel continues to talk to them that's why they're here the guardian angel will try to influence them to do what's right and not wrong or to to ask for forgiveness i mean uh that's what your guardian angel is there they're garden protect your soul as well as them and so i'm quite sure that they've been given guidelines by god when they're sent at the time of conception that is when your guardian angels are sent so life begins at conception people i know the angels show up and they'll be waiting outside the mother for that baby to be born so they can start speaking things of god they sing to the babies you can't hear them and that's many times a little baby is looking all over the room they're seeing the angels whenever mine they bring mine here and where i live to visit me they're always looking at the angels and of course i see their angels with them so they're not going to leave those those children but in the womb you have to understand if anything was spoken by the father holy spirit it would be planted in their spirit somewhere because they are little babies and even jesus as inside the womb of mary had to grow and begin to learn now he learned the normal things to learn even as a little child but at one point he knew he was the son of god all know the story about the caravan where he came of age and he in the father then revealed himself and he knew that he was about the father's business that would be his father in heaven and and from that moment on he was different but up until then i think he probably had to learn like we did instead he faced every every kind of temptation or trial or whatever that we ourselves have had to face in our lives so even growing up he had to learn how to be nice kind polite i'm quite sure that joseph taught him a lot of those things himself you know the normal natural things but as far as god imparting and speaking that happens even when children are young my children heard at a very early age at three one of them started being caught up in heaven and shown things and uh they god still speaks to this one grandchild he speaks a lot to the other one so if you're praying for them to know jesus christ and not mr destiny that's very important but make sure when you speak to them yourself don't be harsh i just have to say this is the truth don't yell don't yell and holler out in your house when your baby's born you try to keep an atmosphere of peace and joy as much as you can you don't want to cause distractions in the soul or even in the natural nature of that baby you know babies when they're sung to when they're loved they just grow up differently themselves and ones who are in a household where people are always fighting and screaming so if at all possible and i will tell people all the time don't you feel like you gotta fight go outside pray first before you talk to each other i'm talking to the husband and wife you pray loose all of the wounds ask for grace from god and then have a conversation with them because you don't want to impart um uh a feelings or things into your little child growing up that's why kids usually get into crime their parents were either in crime or they didn't treat them very well but god is adamantly told me to make sure that i'm saying to all the ones who are related to me make sure that you have peace in your household that when you talk to your children you can still correct them but don't scream and yell and make them feel degraded it is not good for that child if my mom was sitting next to me she'd be sitting right here uh uh nodding her head yeah so it is important the atmosphere you create and i know sometimes there's a situation where you're not married to someone who's nice at all make sure you have time for that child to encourage them and i will say this and this is true you as a watcher over their soul because that's who you are you're raising a soul in the kingdom adam was called a living soul because that's your whole inside that's what you think you choose then your emotions are displayed if they have seen or witnessed something when the other person leaves you lay your hand on their head and say as a watcher over their soul i choose with my will to lose all of the trauma of the harsh words the profanity uh anything that would hurt my child someone anyway i loose it in jesus name and guess what jesus will come and take all that stuff out of that child i tell people if you adopt kids who are in very abusive situations you really need to do that lay your hand on their head and say as a watcher of their soul i choose my will to lose trauma abuse that happened even in the past harsh unkind words you know any words the enemy loose it out of their soul and jesus will come pull it out and then it can't affect their future and confine the love and the life of god to them in the past we didn't know all this we knew of course that we would pray this is a very high level of prayer to declare a decree but you're really using the keys to the kingdom that i give you the keys to the kingdom okay and it's about binding and losing if somebody bullied your kid at school whatever you do when they come home lay your hand in their head said i choose my will to lose all the bullying the meanness any hate uh any abuse out of my child's soul and i've had testimonies from parents that did that and it was like it never happened wow wow cat okay let me ask you this question you talked about um uh wasn't what wasn't the question but i really wanted to key in on this because you said you talked about jesus learning as a child he had to learn there's a scripture in king james that says he and he learned obedience by the things he suffered and i always said that was an odd scripture that jesus learned obedience by the things he suffered is there any more detail you can uh yeah he learned he learned obedience because there were consequences yeah i'm sure if he said something sharp or harsh himself while he was growing up uh that he got corrected i'm sure that uh even god has given given a dynamics of how to raise a child and that is with affection um correction and direction and i'm sure you need all three of those when you're raising up children i'm sure joseph and mary both employed that with jesus especially mary knowing that he had a powerful call on his life and so he learned that there would be consequences i'm not saying when he was older and he already knew that he belonged to the father but i'm saying before that time you know if he did something he shouldn't have done something i'm quite sure that mary and joseph both had consequences for him and he did so in other words the things he went through and learned there's going to be consequences and he did grow and also there's a scripture that i love as he walked in obedience to his parents and honored his parents and i promise you he just jesus honored joseph as the one who raised him and mary as you know his mother he honored them and there's promises but in luke 2 52 this is my favorite scripture and jesus because they've been walking in obedience and learning how to live jesus increase in wisdom and stature and favor with god and man that's good so that is what will result in your own child when you raise them with consequences you know and you have those three things affection direction or affection correction and direction uh then that will be the result that your child will increase in wisdom that's understanding right knowing and stature that means his integrity uh his personal character and favor now you have to see because of his obedience he got favor not just with god but with man so 252 you should write that down and remember that when you're declaring over your child and and cat on this you know the scripture is very cl plain that he uh clear that that he he was attempted in all points and yet without sin is it possible that before he became that 12 year old or 13 year old boy he did sin in the sense of he had to be corrected with something or how do you explain that steve you don't always get corrupted for sin okay uh they did they made a not a good decision that wasn't necessarily sin right okay sin is rejecting we know the basic of basis of sin is rejecting jesus christ and then you get into areas where you you there's a there's an age of accountability nobody knows that age god from that point on you have grace and you can have correction from your parents um to go in the right direction but maybe it was something that was didn't please his parents or maybe he shouldn't have done that didn't make it a sin so there's a difference in the sin and not making good decisions that's good so i think the consequences jesus faced as growing up would be not good decisions okay i don't think he outright sin because he said without sin right yeah he faced it all even as an adult but he didn't sin so we weren't talking about when you got corrected you know when you make wrong decisions that's how you learn not to get into sin later that's really good remember how to stay on the right path when you walk in obedience and honor to those who are over you you know uh then you already learn how to walk on that path and then you yourself can have integrity like luke 252 so i'm not ever saying he outright sin because it didn't live without it but being young and immature you know we do make mistakes and our parents have to drag us back in line and and give us correction and direction that's the most important part the direction um but don't forget affection that's good that's the best explanation i've heard on that uh totally that's totally totally yeah i know a lot of people that was totally from the father affection uh correction and direction you can't leave one of them out you will not have a full rounded child if you do nothing to give direction all the time and correction they're not going to know how to love that you're leaving the love out but you can't just have affection and direction and not have corruption they'll think that you that that the world owes them everything and they won't consider other people and you can't even just have affection and correction and not direction they won't even know what to do and i've seen some kids raised that way they couldn't make decisions on how to save how to look for a job so you need all three the father gave this he said this guess what this is how the father operates with us affection correction and direction nice yeah good okay now let me ask a question you i know you and manuel johnson each tell many stories about or several stories where god has taken you to the future not showing you the future taking you there and then he's also taking you back in time and you didn't you weren't shown that you were actually there bobby connor talks about being at the crucifixion he was there it was he was there so that's in my head and then this question comes from wendy which is interesting about time she says does the anointing work backwards in time for instance if i release the anointing into a doorknob and i pray that that it touches everybody who has touched the knob in the past and future would that work that's an interesting question so they're they're wanting to pray backwards in time well i'm not quite sure that would work yeah that's an interesting one i know i have many conversations about going back and changing everything in time i i have to say personally the father has never told me that was possible the only thing i know about something like that ever happening in in probably rarely that somebody was sent back that i don't do this i don't do that don't ask me to do it because they hadn't decided to go back and rescue somebody really would have died so they'll be here in this time i have never ever and i don't see anywhere in the bible that says you can go back and change everything so uh somebody would never live well i know people who want they want to go back in time and wipe out hitler uh so none of that stuff would happen but i have to tell you there are things on timelines that are going to happen how we deal with them and how we respond to them in that time is really what matters i do not think you can choose on your own i'm going to go back in this time and wipe out somebody so none of that would happen sometimes there are certain people sent that that are birthed through or because of these people that then later become great people and you would have wiped out all of that you can't see it as i'm going to fix this one thing you moving somebody off the earth that never existed and never wouldn't their genealogy would be gone and yet great people came out of some people who weren't good so you are not going to change this whole world right now to be perfect this is not heaven one day it will be perfect and and there's some people who try their whole life to do this um you can't really pray over people who are in the past right they're not there anymore they're not here anymore and i think people get really focused on that it could even be a distraction i'm not saying what you're wanting is not a good thing i'm just saying it's not going to happen yeah he shows me things to have true revelation on how those things happen or what really took place like in the spirit realm back in that time and things like that but but i know people personally who want to go back in other words you can't say well i wish i'd met this person years ago i'll go back in time and make it happen then it only met them and not the others you you're not gonna do that okay you're not god number one you aren't changing god's timeline of what is going to happen and so i would encourage you pray for what's going on right now you can pray into the future though you can make a stand for you and your family line up to a thousand generations you can declare over them and that will make a difference of those coming in the future your life should be focused on future current and future that's good because you are not going to change the path now kat let me tell you a really short version of something that talks right into the future it was a bizarre incident about god had me encount encountered like 15 years ago he took me to a jewish cemetery in in queens new york okay and what there's this bizarre it's too hard to explain why i ended up there i saw these two people that then disappeared i'm convinced they were angels they told me where the entrance is the largest jewish cemetery in this part of new york i ended up in this jewish cemetery and i was looking for a place to hide and pray okay i found only one spot in the entire cemetery is like this horse shoot in i thought why am i here lord i have no idea i got on my knees nobody could see me that's why i chose that spot god didn't say go here i was just trying to hide yeah and i and and so i thought i got nothing to pray i started thinking looking at the headstone thinking well may you know that scripture about ezekiel prays for the bones to come alive and i was going through my head and i said well i don't know about that but i'm gonna pray and the name on the headstone was finkelstein or finkelstein however he said and so i said lord i pray for every living relative of finkelstein from these finkelsteins to be blessed blah blah i prayed something like that just like that i wrote this up on the elijah list and this guy wrote to me from germany he said steve hold on to your hat while you were doing that we had a special guest from israel whose last name was finkelstein and she said i will never go to germany not after they did this to my people and during that time you were praying she was weeping because of all the healing that was taking place now that's praying it forward right yes it is yes that amazing isn't that amazing yes and i'm sure that um god did put that on your heart to pray that specific prayer at that very time yeah even though you didn't hear him say to go there i'm sure your angel was impressing you even though you couldn't see him that was something god needed spoken he needed it released and spoken in the earth and you did it when things line up with god's timing it is the most amazing significant thing you will experience in your life when that happens but just that one little act of doing that uh not even understanding it because look at look at what that reached that was powerful yeah it was powerful awesome awesome okay um i want to make sure cat have you seen jesus seated at the right hand of the father on his throne or does he share a throne i've always wondered that's a confusing scripture does he sit on the same sea or does he share a throne because he's seated beside the father then he seated with the father so what is it i think it's whatever they want at the time i have seen both i've seen christ on a throne by himself i have seen him many times sitting in his father's throne right next to him i have seen that happen i think also significantly to let people know is there is one general massive throne room i call it the general throne room because there's more than one throne room there's the commissioning throne room there's the throne room that's connected to the courtroom there's another a courtroom where people are given in the spirit weapons to pray with there's more than one i think the commissioning throne room is in our calendar when we did the one the most recent one we did for 2021 it has a picture of the father on the commissioning throne room and that's the one that has the horns before the altar and he actually puts mantles on people and when he's going to give you a new mantle your layer of you that looks just like you you yourself are seated and have any places in heaven if you people caught up there you might see yourself sitting on the throne that would be a spiritual image of you is called into the commissioning throne room he literally puts a mantle on you when you hold on the horns of the altar and he's decreeing things over you at that time in your life there could be someone praying those very things over you or you felt something come over you something and then the holy spirit began to speak to you but the general throne room is the one mentioned in the book of revelations revelations 4 what sau where john is caught up and sees the father with the with the rainbow coming in and out of him is very clear uh he doesn't see jesus at that point but he sees the father on his throne and and the rainbow's moving in and out of him and even when um they i think it was uh was it ezekiel that saw the throne moving being moved yeah the wheels and the wheels the wheels within wheels yes that's the spirit of the living creature that comes out it looks like a gyroscope it's more like this it's not like a wheel within just a wheel it's not like that it's like something that would move i've seen that but so there's many different places in the bible it talks about the throne but i totally have seen him sitting right next to his father then again i've seen times when i saw jesus just on a throne and you know if you don't know he also has his own mansion in heaven jesus has a mansion the father has a personal place that is his in heaven also it's not like the throne is vacated usually one or the other are in there especially if someone's coming home to heaven they will both be in that throne room but i've seen him sitting right next to the father or something does everyone come home to the throne room is that what you're saying you have to okay okay because i'm always picturing showing up at the gate somewhere you know always the jokes about saint peter wait i don't really mean saint peter but but but he meets you at the gate yeah some sort of gate thing or something there is a huge gate the one with the portals is a massive gate but but there is a disembarking place like we have airports where you a certain place you don't land in anybody's yard there's a place when you arrive somewhere that you come to whether it's a train depot or something like that there's a there's a depot when you're caught up whether you're in any kind of a transport or really and a chariot up to heaven the first place you will always come to is this depot in heaven which is gorgeous you see the river of life you see the gates a little way off and a lot of family members or pets are waiting for you there like i saw oral roberts when he came home the masses were out there to welcome him and um so you're you're there and then jesus many times will greet you finally escort you into the throne room he's the one who walks you back up the throne to the father it says he is the door it says jesus is the only way back to the father so jesus himself eventually no matter who comes up in heaven he will come get them and walk them up the steps to the throne and say look father here's your son here's your daughter they've come home wow individually everybody gets that individually individually very cool very cool i don't think i ever understood that wow i love this stuff all right um the bible describes the four creatures oh you just talked about that in ezekiel and revelation as being covered in eyes why eyes and their question is what do eyes represent i don't know if it represents something it is something right it's a it's useful eyes right they're doing something right there [Laughter] yeah you know they're not just there for good looks right no that they help why do you have eyes to use something yeah to see right because she says what do they represent and i'm thinking they're not representing right they're actually doing those wheels when the the wheels with them within the wheels it is the spirit of the living creatures that talks about it on the throne it that part of them comes out and it navigates they didn't lose their eyes in their head they didn't lose their eyes all over their body they have thousands of eyes in their wings these are the living creatures and it talks about this it says it says in the bible that that that wheel in the wheel of the spirit living creature it's gonna move the throne it comes out it's gonna navigate it's gonna move it it has to see where it's taking the throne so these eyes are living they're not pictures of eyes they're not just paintings of eyes these are living eyes that are in these wheels within the wheel and i may get something like that to represent that and they literally they catch them and they navigate the throne wherever it goes in heaven or wherever now the living creatures are there but that wheel within the wheel that's their spirit that's part the navigation throne so it has to see whatever has eyes in heaven is alive yeah it's just a being it's a spirit or it is like one of the hosts or something like that okay wow live okay now here's a question about they want to know about does the spirit does the holy spirit have a sense of humor does he say funny quips or she actually said funny jokes but i'm i don't know yeah so tell me yes yeah between between father son and holy spirit holy spirit is the drama king that is his nickname in heaven he is a very funny he's very focused very serious he loves to put on a show and i don't know what else you would call it back in the days when the holy spirit was falling on people everywhere speaking in tongues is quite a show if you've never seen or heard it it's very powerful it is the holy spirit speaking through the mouth of these the of the people that invite him to indwell them he moves into so think you get jesus right you get holy spirit you already got a show going on the inside of you holy spirit loves drama he loves um he loves movies he loves he loves theatrical stuff good decent exciting powerful stuff because some people have this picture of how it is on earth it's not always good to talk about those things no holy spirit does have the greatest sense of humor of all three of them oh wow and he is the one who gives me the one liners to say to people when they don't want to hear them or when they love it and they hear it it's always him that gives it to me and if i'm talking about something he will say to me talk about this like right now just stop and talk about this that's him uh so he totally will get involved in your life he does give you direction it says so uh sometimes it's direction because you need to know sometimes it's because he wants you to so he's just he's the pageantry guy he's the funny man he's the he loves pageantry he's the life of the party guy huh yeah he does now jesus loves jesus also does love you know to celebrate he loves celebrations uh and he loves sweets he just does and he loves flowers and he loves to dance and he dances with everybody in the throne sometimes these mass big dances they have and that may not be in your mind your mind is what in the world are we going to do besides bowing before the throne of god i'm telling you they would be bored these the fathers and the holy spirit are not boring people they're very much love to celebrate they love victories they love to war and see victory come they love victory in your life and they celebrate and rejoice it says they celebrate over one person just one person coming home to heaven there you go out the one person uh they they love life and they actually live life in heaven there's no oppression there's no doom and gloom there's no threats there's no fear there's no rejection there's none of that there there's life and living life at its fullest and that's why he gives us what he gives us grace for abundant life that's an abundance you have to have joy you have to have celebration um everybody wants to you know make sure things are taken care of and we should we should make sure you know that we're being uh having integrity with with money and if you think i'm misspending money i will just give you this if he sends it he spends it oh that's a good one any money it's where god wants it spent and how he wants it spent maybe you should start saying that god i would love to have this much money if you send it i'll let you spend it and then he will influence you to make sure it's okay for you to have money it's okay to have good things uh god wants us to be blessed but remember other people who don't remember if you say if you get a bunch of money say god is there somewhere you want me to spend some of this money i promise you he's going to tell you but that is my motto no matter what i end up by having if he sends that money and he does through many sources he is going to have the right to spend that money that's good you know i love that line too i had not heard you talk about bars in heaven but this relinda says can you talk about the bars you saw in heaven i guess they mean is there some sort of a starbucks place or what what what have you told people i don't remember that one well i think they may be talking about the kind of cell alcohol i don't know and they can't be talking about alcohol unless it's spiritual alcohol yes i will tell you the only a neighbor i can't even say this yeah that's an inebriated inebriated in heaven is from the holy spirit yeah his presence just causes that to happen you laugh out loud i mean you fall on the road the streets of gold sometimes laughing out loud because of the prince of the holy spirit the only wine they have in heaven it does not have alcohol alcohol this may be a crusher just loose it from your soul no beer no hard liquor no there's not in heaven nothing cages nothing ferments it's not going to happen but you will have holy spirit wine to drink and let me tell you you'll never have a hangover from i've never drank i've never experienced that and don't want to have no desire for it i'm actually very much against alcohol don't offer me a drink you will get a message okay i'm just going to save it for free yeah people excuse me of drinking they're lying out right because i despise that my dad used to rescue surviving alcoholics and i saw what it did so let's go back to heaven there are places you can go into that people are playing music and the joy of the lord and uh people who do guitar and stuff like that um not elvis doesn't do that but elvis does play in his own room many times himself wow yes there's they're more it's more like i guess what what are they called pubs i guess it's more like a pub place you could eat food delicious food you can have wine from heaven if you want to and then you come out and you fall off your stool and they drag you out and laugh in the streets that kind of thing happens but it isn't tied to darkness or evil you're not going to be drunk god talks against drunkards and you know he says strong drink is a mocker is going to mock you with your life so you shouldn't go there right you should go there and the the the wine that they talk about in the bible biblical wine was i think three percent alcohol people uh i would very not even very good to pour it on a wound but when you hear about celebrations most jews drank um that's the wine they drink is three percent alcohol it's not 25 or 100 proof you know 100 100 proof of holy spirit maybe yeah but but in one way she is kind of right there are places to go you meet with your friends you laugh and talk and celebrate together but only the holy spirit's presence they have vineyards in heaven everybody can jump in the baths and mash the grapes they put them in these huge vests i've been there and then holy spirit literally will invade every single vat nice nice in these vineyards so when you drink it you're getting filled with him not with jesus there are things like now i'm not a coffee drinker but most of the earth loves all the different varieties of coffee and frappuccinos that's about the coffee steve yeah so are there these places with all kinds of coffees yes there are and there are people who grow coffee beans in heaven because everybody that was a gift they were given by god i actually know somebody down the street from where i'm living right now uh in my offices still but we are still packing to move uh martin who was from england had martin's coffee shop i think it was called coffee shop uh cafe martin's cafe jen corrected me and uh they had every kind of delicious yummy are you seeing heaven is this kind of stuff what what you could get in england scotland or island he sold that but he is he was well known for his coffee and he was not born again but when we at our church of 4 000 decided to have women's meetings which i got to cook the food for wasn't that lovely martin decided because so many people go there and he knew them decided to he would give us every tuesday i think it was tuesday a huge coffee cake that he made and he blessed us with it he wasn't even a christian he said i'm gonna i'm gonna bless you all with this because you come you come to my coffee shop you help me so i'm gonna bless you well all the women would pray over that coffee cake he would see for his salvation guess what he is in heaven he has a coffee shop does he does he now wow you can visit martin's coffee shop and they do it like that like he would have martin's coffee shop at just the same thing very cool no alcohol but definitely the coffee the hot chocolates probably the i don't drink coffee but i'm a hot chocolate person people don't that's me i'm i'm a hot chocolate guy you know and if i if someone gives me uh coffee and i just like i put too much sugar in it because it needs to get close to hot chocolate oh you can't make hot chocolate people and if you put chocolate why don't you put coffee i have a recipe i'm not going to give it to you i have a recipe when i go to these uh coffee shops but it's for my hot chocolate and they look really strange at me like you want that and they're like do you only keep the good stuff for the coffee or can i have a little bit of the you know the toffee nut and i want more mocha chocolate stuff than they normally give you and i use whole milk water i don't do white water that's watered down milk i don't do white water i do whole milk okay me too the creamier the better add whipped cream to it whipped cream yeah lots of whipped cream yeah you and me cat oh just so you know the cups are this big i don't even have a cup big enough i could show you gentlemen or a hot chocolate cup would be like this big it's like so people would no um if in heaven if people are sitting around drinking all these massive things of coffee um are and they're they're talking they're talking for hours it seems like right and so if they're talking for hours is the entire conversation about the lord or are they talking about this family member and that activity what what what would you have you heard conversations it's like most of my conversations i had two in the department store yesterday i just started because of my hair of course i got to share heaven what's going on i mean they get the whole thing and oh i love your pink hair what's that or they'll say where are you from and i'll go heaven i have a heaven conversation in the department store uh i do talk about other things sometimes like i love horses you know i did so people in heaven depending on what encounters they're having you can have encounters in heaven with jesus really okay person to person you can have one with the father they talk a lot about that but they do talk about family they do talk about friends people go on tours all over heaven maybe they just got to go to the valley of the falls you know see these 200 foot waterfalls or dive down in them maybe they got to go to the mountain of spices and see fall leaves this big that never dropped their colors wow and they're all in these places talking about their experiences they just had and how amazing and then they go oh what have you been here have you seen this isn't god good to us don't you love having us beyond anything yes they have conversations like that that's good now do they do do they have conversations you know i've asked you this in different ways over the years about reminiscing do they reminisce about how our children came to the lord or is that so old news that it's all current my family over here is doing this and my daughter over there has a coffee shop and my son over there has a uh old car model t shop what what what did they talk about family yeah i think they do both okay i think they they don't have their memory their whole memory is not taken away i think your memories of really tragic traumas you don't talk about them in heaven at all but certainly fun times you have with your family when they and their child could be sitting next to them now you're still going home as your father son and daughter but you still remember your family members you live near them you go on trips together so yeah you can talk about fun things that you did on the earth sometimes uh real important ones was how they got born again okay yeah and the other thing you talk about is you're taken to a theater when you go to heaven that shows your whole life relived with all of the sins and the and the evil and harsh things that happen removed and you will see every time your angel intervened saved your life how holy spirit influenced you what was going on in heaven when you did certain things on the years and the prayers how they changed your life you see all that the first thing you want to do is go to the coffee shop next to this place and talk to all your friends about that how your angel intervened and because your friends go sometimes to watch your life we live you know i my my you know i've told many many times on this program i have a very very abusive father he's with the lord now he's been with me he loves you oh awesome and i love him and he's been there about 30 years but but the life of my life especially as a child let's say my up to my teenage years or yeah or young adults was was the word the abuse so how does he so does he replay my childhood showing me this momentary good thing with my father this momentary good thing so i would end up with memories only of the good things he ever did yes yeah because in you um in anyone in heaven there's no sorrow there's no fears there's no regrets even you don't even have regrets it's gone it's not part of your and you have to remember you're in your spiritual body right your soul is with you your soul does not sleep your body sleeps in the earth your body sleeps but your soul with all the memory banks that has in it even if you approach to something there would be no wounding you can't be re-wounded in heaven it's not going to be trauma again but but most people don't even think about that they're so thrilled and amazed that they're there they think about the goodness of god they will usually talk about the good memories and the good things that happen even the movie is not like a solid movie it sometimes leaves out years of your life on purpose you're not going to expose these theaters are not to expose every wicked evil thing that you did is it's about the grace and the goodness of god and how he influenced you your angels influenced you how they saved your life how they brought you up spiritually together with other people that you were involved in ministry or stuff the good stuff it's the good stuff that you get to see so that you come out so filled with life and gratitude for god now people give testimonies in heaven uh someone new comes home everybody wants to go hear them um talk about their life on the earth they're always always going to talk about the power of god the goodness of god his mercies to them and so people when somebody comes home i they're all probably still trying to hear uh halftime is here or robert speak or billy joe daughtry or smith wigglesworth the people want to get to know but mainly if somebody new comes they all have certain events where they can go and speak in people or you can invite them to speak to your own friends and stuff in heaven so everybody wants to know what did you think when you first stepped out of your body well they do they do talk about that okay they do how did you feel when you knew you were gone right your body was lifeless you turned around you don't know you're dead sometimes steve because you feel you're as a spiritual being you will be able to feel your body you can pass through this these natural walls but but there's a spirit realm everywhere where your spiritual body when it steps out it's alive filled with the life of god the joy here you for the first time seeing your guardian angels or jesus has come in his own chariot to pick you up but you're like oh you are so undone and excited and waves of joy begin to feel you fled over you so everybody wants to hear how did you feel when that happened oh wow i didn't know that happened that was really good good to hear wow thinking of my mom who's very close and uh to see that happen to her to know that it's not to see it because i'm not a seer but and you do see you've been uh at the bedside of more than one person who passed you watch them step out don't you i did i did uh my husband's best friend who was a native american indian we called him chief that was his nickname uh he decided to stay in florida instead of go back to the reservation when he got out of the marines they were in the marines together he was somebody who laughed he was such a great person he laughed everything he never wanted to take him to a funeral he would laugh because he had that joy in him and uh so we really loved him a lot he got married his wife eventually passed away and he he really missed her after after she passed away and so then he wasn't feeling well i think he just wanted to go to heaven anyway we were with him a lot in the last few weeks especially my husband actually went and cared for him and i was out speaking and my husband called and they said the the hospital is telling me they don't think he'll make it through the night so we came directly from the airport to his hospital room and he was like in icu and this precious person who wasn't um used to be a hospice nurse was had gotten um i guess he got trained to be an intern or something he was there present with him he was so undone that we were we came to be with him even though we weren't family family i said oh he is like family and i knew everything that was going on i saw angels waiting somewhere in the room some were just his own angels were around his bed all the time they were touching him they were saying things in his ear i had time to call each of our daughters and let them say goodbye to him because he was that precious to them and then and the guy said well he's going to be another eight hours and i'm like no he's not i was telling he said how do you know that i see the angels who are about to come in i said they're waiting they're waiting for us to make sure we get our daughters to say goodbye and he's going to go he's probably maybe in the next hour he'll be gone he said oh i don't think so well it's okay it's all right don't worry about it and so this is our last daughter said to him in his ears no he wasn't responding i mean he his heartbeat was still going but his angels were watching everything we did they would smile every time wow her daughters got to say it went in his spirit it went into spirit and i saw the words going in his spirit it was very powerful and then more and more angels began to come in behind the others and i went it's not going to be very long and so my husband said goodbye to him i said goodbye to him and there was a rush there was a rush you could i could hear and feel the rush the rush of angels filling the room and then he goes his spiritual body went out and went well he's gone and he goes no he's not and then there goes zayn [Laughter] then he starts to cry he goes you really saw that happen i'm like yes this is what happened he said i always thought that they were alone everybody was alone they died and went no no their angels do not leave them if they're going to heaven they can't leave them they'll always be with them and when they step out of their body the first thing they'll see is they're greening their guardian angels so they're getting to finally see the one who's been with them since they were since before they were born actually so i saw them all according to the room filled with light shh and they rushed in and took him and went up wow well he's gone wow wow okay and it's amazing to me that you know god could have done it with just one angel he didn't need a room full of it what's what's the deal with that why why we're our benefit to know uh chief loved people he would give you the shirt off his back he was so kind and he loved people i think it was out of honor of how he lived his life i think it was about the honor he had uh not even so much as us but i got to witness it and the more you honor god with your life um the more are going to be present to escort you home to heaven and like i saw i mean i saw many known people uh being taken up to heaven and jesus came and got them himself and in his fiery chariot and he just held out his hand he said come on it's time to go home and they would not even hesitate to get there the guardian angels were right there so it is a powerful you're seeing a hospital room with you know the bags hooked to them you see this but in the spirit if you're love and belong to jesus christ there is a celebration going on around you in that room you don't wait to get to heaven to have the peace and joy of god it floods the room that's what part of the light was that light came and filled his physical body with that light and then it took his spirit man just came out wow filled with joy and celebration they were celebrating that he was going home to heaven so even though you thought they were alone they died not alone if they belong to jesus christ so so so many people are hearing this and their fear of death is leaving them i mean i can feel it happen that is very very cool so many hundreds hundreds of thousands you have more light spiritual bodies the room is filled with the light of god the glory coming off of your angels the grins on their faces and uh if it's your guardian angel and you liked something like i still remember the young man who passed who was like a comedian he passed young and he used to wear this clown nose all the time in church just to make jokes to people and everything when he passed i saw it when he he the angel tried to get him to come and get him to come and and he didn't look up and finally goes it's time to go when he looks up his own angel is wearing a red clown nose are you serious are you serious and then the young man did not hesitate he just went forward like this he stepped out his physical body fell back and he said here's one for you and gave him a clown nose to wear on his trip home to heaven that's hilarious that is hilarious well kat thank you thank you thank you for this tell people about your two websites we really haven't on the screen really tell people rebuilding heaven.com is where you find out our about our events our products we do have a store we're going to be adding a whole lot of

well greetings and happy wednesday february 16 22. welcome to the broadcast we're very i'm very very excited about this broadcast because i katz agreed to answer um a really important question here in just a few minutes we'll talk about other things that are mined and my first question is going to be and she's ready for it what do you do when a family member goes rogue and i'm going to give her a couple of real life things that we know about that we've heard where suddenly a family member just completely goes off and they've got some real keys even almost like secret tips that they don't even know what you're doing but how you can uh i answer or even really honestly part of it so i'm really really excited about it so if you have a friend that this would apply to i'll be sure and have a quick text and have them listen to the broadcast but sure and subscribe to elijahlist.com because after every broadcast we will email to your inbox the the program the link to it an intro the photo so you can see it see it and send it and get it all over the place um it's just one more way of course you can share from youtube you can share it from facebook as well but that's one easy way if you're like if you're kind of an email person like me so all right and by the way a quick reminder that tim sheets will be on tomorrow he's got some revelation about i don't i can't remember exactly which day it started last week or the week before but a 54-day prophecy about something that's going to happen and 54 days of change julie just typed in there so i guess it's more about the changes that will happen there so i'm looking forward to hearing it actually hearing tim's sheets do it so uh to teach on that or revelato and that might be a better way to say it all right well i think that's it let's bring in cat curry i'm real excited about this one hello cat hi that's so good to see you i'll tell you i'm so excited about today we're gonna bushwhack the enemy people is payback time okay that's what it is and uh now you can you know when the enemy tries to attack you you should definitely begin to attack the things that are important to him uh and he realizes he's not gonna get away with attacking us anymore it's not it's just not going to work okay when you've got revelations so this is exciting day awesome i'm so excited i really really am um so i'll share those two examples in a minute anything else you want to share uh about anything current events or whatever before we get into those questions i just know there's an amazing a social media launch happening i think it may be even already starting or about to start right now from number 45 uh if you haven't checked out you should probably go to his website and find out about it but we are going to have so much freedom right now coming with all of us to be in contact with number 45 awesome i think that's probably the most exciting thing i could say is happening right now um it's going to be like almost not the devil's worst nightmare but pretty close to it it's about to happen it's called his his social media is called truth social and they originally said it was going to come on towards the end of february and now they're saying some beta versions which means some people will be testing it that's the beta yeah now they're saying that it will actually come on the end of march which is disappointing because i wanted it now you know but i think it decides how the test goes steve i think if the tests go great i think it will be launched much quicker than that oh good that would be awesome awesome and they're saying you know they're not going to shadow band shadow banning is when you write something and you know and it starts to get a lot of play and your friends are liking it and all of a sudden no one likes it anymore it's just stops not a new livestream that's called shadow banning that's what facebook does uh and when they don't like what you're doing they shadow about it they make it go away so that they're not sharing it with all your friends like they're supposed to that's right and you don't know the difference because there's nothing you can see that says you've been shadow banned it just stops you know and so truth social is not going to do that they're not even going to do that on the left they're going to let people say even on truth social what they want to say so it's going to become very popular very fast yes so well okay anything else before we get in these questions i just want to make sure i give you i just want to say i know this is not valentine's day but here where we live in our our household and in our office we actually will celebrate a holiday for a whole week so we're still going full strength with valentine's day right uh week of luck that's what we call it and this is actually my valentine's scarf i'm wearing right now it just happens my pink hair which goes well with valentine's day so i just want to say we love you we thank all of you for the prayers for the support for the for the the true prophets to have a place to speak we thank especially steve schultz and elijah streams and all their amazing team members who are about to get some sweets set personally for me i hope they enjoy i will pray they don't get addicted to it because it's amazing i'll share that on another show but um we will eventually have this sweet this delicacy actually on our store i call them fudgies um but they're all handed me by me all of your team out there steve showed you the idea of the anointing in every one of them so we love you we really appreciate you all those i tell you i just started going through cards again last night and saw all the states that are sending stuff to us information and almost every one of them is thinking the elijah's stream so again i ask you please make sure you support him i'm just going to start from the beginning but we have a powerful show today make sure you maybe take notes because this is a great time when you've been living in revelation especially as long as i have you learn things that really do work against the enemy so um we can go ahead and get started let's let's jump into that question because i don't know take as long as you want in this that you don't have to rush through because we have other questions just take whatever time you need to do this but there's here's two actual um situations we're obviously not saying names but there's a father who was a good father he raised his family uh he and his wife i think uh i'm just i'm going to avoid saying things in case someone's listening and it might be uh yeah identify so he has he and his wife have married 25 years all was well and then he discovered marijuana and then not only did he discover marijuana but he discovered and he went out and found the highest potency marijuana with the highest level of thc uh and kat his brain is just almost fried he doesn't know he's suddenly an enemy to his wife he said he said you've always been this evil bad person uh he was in the car i'm told he was in the car like last week or recently and threatened his wife if you don't stop confronting me on this marijuana i'm gonna drive this car off the road and kill us both and this is a man who was a christian and all of that happened now so now cat so and i'll tell you the other one in a second but he is not in his right mind to even confront okay so that's that one um now the other one and i'm sure there were other details but we won't give too many because i don't want to identify yeah you don't need a whole lot just let people know um these things will affect your mind and they'll tell you they never will but uh i lived through a time i lived through the 60s when a lot of drugs were introduced and i'll go into that in a minute so go ahead and share the other scenarios so here's the other one there's a family raised several children uh all to all were baptized all were raised to love the lord all got married loving the lord and one of them the couple the son and daughter-in-law out of nowhere just started becoming buddhists they started putting up buddhist paraphernalia they started then they added crystals to it and they just became buddhist out of nowhere and and so how is it chris so that then we you know hitch would hit whichever one of these you want to first but of course the generic question is what's a parent supposed to do they're going didn't we did we do something wrong did we you know that kind of thing so i'm going to throw that to you and see what you have to to say about that well first of all i want to say this um especially if these family members of yours uh ever gave themselves to jesus now i'm not saying the others don't have a chance to come back but if they ever gave themselves to jesus christ even as a child you know what that does he puts his mark on them and he he won't lose them he won't let them get lost and i know for years we had a family member who was kind of doing that not like a sibling or something that were they were doing some of the same stuff we just talked about and god said you can't stop what you're doing to go after them you will be the last person to convince these people there's something wrong with them uh you'll be the last one that they'll even listen to probably not want to listen to is as he said in the first scenario uh they don't want to hear from you number one your family member and god can send other people but the point is this if they gave themselves to jesus christ he doesn't abandon them just because they abandoned the walk with him or even who he is and decide to go in a different direction he's not going to let them be lost okay he is going to go after them it says in the bible that he is actually married to the backslider okay that's another word that's who we would call these people uh if they lived righteously they gave himself to jesus christ you know had a real commitment and children let me tell you can't tell me they don't i got born again at four it was such a dramatic a traumatic not dramatic dramatic experience for me being a seer that when i invited him i actually saw jesus step inside of me even children at a very young age it is important to introduce jesus christ to them and even pray with them to know him because let me tell you it puts something in your spirit that even they can't make leave and the why the reason why this is important is the whole time your family members are out there we just call it going rogue because that means they've gone off the track they've left where they were i'm talking about spiritually emotionally physically and even mentally drugs alcohol being involved in spiritual darkness will all begin to alter who you are and how you think because your soul is impacted it really is all about your soul but if you ever gave yourself to jesus and if you're listening right now and you you're going through this yourself you're one of the robes i can say lay down roll over and give up because jesus christ is going to get you okay your family's not going to give up on you those in heaven who know you aren't giving up on you you may as well just give up and get rid of the darkness and get rid of of the evil that's impacted your life because you you belong to jesus christ still okay so that's the number one thing you need to know because that helps to bring peace to people you know you can't necessarily stop what's happening with them of course you pray and ask jesus to rescue them and that's wonderful but when you yourself are given weapons in the word and by jesus christ to come after and crush the darkness that is surrounding them and number one of course will be the host of heaven to send them to put on strongholds when the enemy can't get you and this is the absolute truth when the enemy that would be satan okay we're not talking about a person we're talking about an empty spiritual entity uh satan who iniquity was found and born in him by the way just so you know god didn't make satan he made lucifer who was a powerfully anointed beautiful being who was anointed lead worship in heaven he himself chose in his own soul to become evil and that was born in him it's the only thing satan actually invented was evil uh if you want to know the truth and so god didn't make him that way as god didn't make anybody who's going rogue was going off the tracks running after darkness um pursuing things that are dangerous to them and then make them not even even sensible in their own mind that's what the enemy does if you're a strong belief likely you have family members or really close people you call family that are involved in being a rogue person out there because if the enemy can't get you can't get you to come to his side can't get you to live in sin or defile your person or corrupt your mind you know or make yourself uh incomprehensible to even make sense in things if he can't get you to do that he'll go after those closest to you it's just his mo it's the way he operates so if you're already prepared and ready even if you don't have somebody going that way you'll already know how to take authority over that and what to say about it so number one jesus has got people and i remember when this one team remember we have we were praying jesus said i have him he is he he was a he he is in my hand and he's running around doing all the stuff he thinks he wants to do because he's gonna be impacted by satan he said all i'm gonna do is i'm gonna go like this and he said and i'll take them and i will get them back into the kingdom that was jesus himself saying that and also i do remember when i was in heaven one of the times i left there jesus said let them know that you're staying for your family member is the most powerful thing you can make a stand that they will know jesus christ they will not miss their destiny that you will be in eternity together and that person who now is probably you know screaming against god or you or family can you imagine you saying that person will become a witness and a testimony to the saving power of jesus christ and those are some of the most powerful words that you can say for anybody you know that has run off and got off the path jumped off the train the train was run over them and just dragging them down the tracks they've gotten that bad and i know that some people who never even got involved in things drugs are one of the worst things you can do and i don't care they can lie and fry all day long to say marijuana is not dangerous it is dangerous it's one of the most used drugs and what happens is you get hooked on that and they won't agree with me with this but but i'm sorry i lived in the 60s as a teenager i would go to school and there'd be some other kid who died from drug overdose because it was just being introduced here in this country and they would give it to you for free they would take you off campus and give it to you and get you hooked on it and then they would have you sell it to the other students that's also how the enemy works and so they would begin to change their nature even if they were the star a sports athlete in the school or the smartest kid in school the first thing you noticed was their attitude change their lifestyle change how they treated other people changed it was that quick it was that quick and so you notice things like that going on you just begin to pray against the darkness that that they would begin to notice so god would wake them up even in the beginning stages of being involved with this stuff but i want to go to the first scenario that steve spoke of like i said marijuana is one of the one of the worst things that anyone can take and they can say all they want to that is good for you it is evil i've known that since i was 16 that it is evil and all it does is harm to you and you will get hooked and this whole lie about we're going to make it medicinal so it now can be licensed and now it's being grown everywhere where before they would arrest you if they found you growing that stuff and now they have shops everywhere and i can just tell you this there are hidden rooms i'm just going to tell there's hidden rooms in some of these places where they let you come in and have parties in these back rooms and they'll give you stronger stuff than you even wanted but you're already beginning to step into the illegal they said they put a boundary about it but i still don't trust it i don't trust it and don't believe in in any way if you're considering and doing it don't do it it's a trap of the enemy and it's also a trap of man because they will make a lot of money off of you desiring to have this and then they will introduce you to stronger ones and i can tell you some of that can be really some some people you know they may not even live past that first time then they would get you hooked on stronger drugs because anything that can alter your mind which is part of your soul the way you think and then it can even alter your will first it affects your mind and then your will and then your emotions because that's what your soul is and and doing drugs no matter what type they are that is exactly how you will be affected that's why you notice the change in the person the way they're thinking what they're talking about uh wanting to go off and not show up in places you know where they're supposed to be there are little types of signs in that and it could be something other than that but many times it is that and so you want to come against number one the effect the effect of it whether it's drugs or alcohol back in the day before the drugs came the same thing was happening with alcohol and you do not want people to drive under the influence is what they call it that's gg alcohol where you certainly don't want them driving under the influence of drugs uh your mind really gets altered and the devil the reason why the devil likes that is he can start putting thoughts in their mind if they're inebriated from alcohol or if they're consumed by the drugs that they're they're taking that are so affecting it's beginning to alter the way they think they think that is themself choosing to think about these things but when you when you open up your mind to the enemy he will begin to bombard you with all kinds of thoughts like you know you hate people these people are against you they don't have the right to judge you you just should end your life i mean even those thoughts can start real early so just so you understand how that works and why it's never ever a good thing to be involved in drugs and not even alcohol if i'm ever with you don't you dare offer me a drink you will be in big trouble and kevin excuse me i'm not i will not touch any kind of alcohol my dad used to rescue alcoholics and let me tell you it ruined your life and it can also this it can affect the unborn even if you're taking them and you're pregnant you don't want to do that to your baby just so you understand how deadly the enemy's weapons are always going to be fear number one deception number two and then any kind of a form of anything he can get you to do uh even like some kind of um uh satanic groups you go into where where you want to be a part of something satanic or or satanic worship or sacrifices yeah in your own mind as a believer i know you think good and you want good and i i live that way i want good for everybody i want people to be made whole i want them to be rescued god sent everyone here for a purpose and he loves everybody but some people he can't use because they themselves are choosing uh to be a part of darkness and the enemy in this time i know there's darkness on the ears by the way it's not the great darkness because i've been taken forward in the times i won't even discuss them into the perilous times which are long long long away from here no matter anybody thinks god's beginning something new for greatness but in this time he is exposing darkness and the enemy right now is trying to take as many people as he can destroy as many justices that he can because in these days of greatness and glory these very people would be very dangerous against him so you have to kind of understand how the enemy thinks and if you're not that kind of a person you probably aren't if you're not into crime you don't have a criminal mind if you're not into darkness or evil you're not going to even think you know or understand how they think so the most important thing when people get are caught off into these things is to begin to pray over their soul and the way they think but the number one thing you need to do is just declaring the blood of jesus over them you do not have to do it in front of them this is the best part of all of this it's like your covert operations with heaven and and let me tell you the army of heaven is waiting holy spirit is waiting uh when you begin to send them against the strongholds pulling on your family member is one of the greatest things that you can do like i was praying for one of those people uh last night and i just said father i take power over all the power of the enemy trying to take and uh uh destroy the life of this person god i command the army of having to go to begin to pull down strongholds being built around this person's mind to affect their soul and i i command the host of heaven to shut the mouths of the demons that they can't speak to these people they cannot influence these people i speak confusion into the mind of the enemy this is the spiritual darkness that they will not even be able to communicate with each other they can't make plans against this person they would not be able to carry out orders from hell against this person so i speak confusion into the mind of the enemy and then i speak the fear of god to come upon the enemy who is pursuing this person to drag them into darkness that whatever they attempt to do it will fail in jesus name these people will not be able to get the drugs that they're running after that they will all of a sudden that that open door will disappear it will be shut and disappear in jesus name that that supply they've been getting from will be gone in jesus name they will have no way to pursue it no way to get it in jesus name and i thank you father right now that we begin to speak in the spirit realm to that person to that person father we we send the life of god the love of god the plans of god to invade wherever they're at right this moment in jesus name and i can tell you as i speak those words i see the hosts leaving i see holy spirit invading the very home of the people who are involved in these things to begin to tear down and pull down strongholds i can see a stronghold will bring itself totally around somebody and continually bombard their mind with thoughts that aren't from god are not from god and are not good thoughts and so i'm going to stop and take a drink request what are you doing let me ask you this one question cat so yours if i'm hurt hearing what you're saying and teaching is that family members probably have a harder time than non-family members reaching someone in this condition and yet the same family members have an easier time sending the host and praying because their family god you're providing a special place right you're right you have more authority in the spirit realm as a family member than anyone else outside your family circle so if you're a believer it's okay to call other people to pray but you know what you are blood related you're blood related related by adoption when there is that time made you and your words in the spirit realm have a greater impact against the enemy than anyone else out there so yes you are the number one person or people who should be coming together to pray over that person to come back to christ but also to pray against the darkness you have the right to cancel their plans i'm talking about the darkness you have the right to say i cancel that assignment against my family member right now in jesus name and i command the host to go and pull down the stronghold shut them out of demons hinder halt and delay and interfere with them able to get these drugs or alcohol or whatever it is your words are powerful they're like spears that go out in the in the into the darkness begin to pierce the enemy who's who's trying to do this many times that first couple times you pray that you'll begin to see a change in that person especially this is something that has just started because the the biggest demons who are trying to do all this have now been pulled down i mean literally the hosts will go and pull them away from them they will dispatch them from them uh and dispel the effects you can even pray this declare this that even when they're taking those drugs it will have no effect on your family member make sure you say their name when you're saying this that they will have no effect whatsoever no matter what they try to do you nullify it you nullify the effects it's having on your family member so here you are coming you're making a stand for their salvation number one always number two you're coming against the very darkness that is trying to pull them into the enemy's camp and number three you're speaking against the effect of anything that they're taking or anything they have taken so there's a three things right there very important and it doesn't matter whether it's i can just say it doesn't matter if it's drugs alcohol pornography whatever it is whatever weapon the enemy is trying to destroy the destiny of your family members with you have power over all of that what the enemy wants you to do though is to get upset get distraught then get in tears break down because then he's controlling both of you he's keeping you from being dangerous against him he's keeping you from standing for that person to come back to christ and he wants to do that trust me so he's got you over here he's controlling you and holding you down and he's still running rampant with your family members so you have to make sure that you lose all fear all anger all all cares all concerns you have to loose out of your own soul because then your soul and your mind will think clearly and you can connect with heaven and if holy spirit is asking you to do anything else you know related to that you'll hear him clearly so number one to even start this whole operation i call it covert operation people that's what it is it's a it's cwc covert with christ that's what it is and you can do this you can do this if you list all those cares concerns and fears from your own soul that the enemy's bombarding you with because that's not you that's the enemy trying to get you to think the way he wants you to and you're thinking clearly and then you begin to bind to your soul the love the power and the blood of jesus christ you're going to become very dangerous against hell so here you are number one speaking and sinning on behalf of the salvation that jesus is not going to give up on those those who were saved and they they went astray you know remember the whole thing where he went after the one lamb that got away from the whole the whole herd of sheep the flock of sheep whatever they're called he went after the one the others were fine they were safe they were supposed to be where they were but the one who went off to the craziness in this whole scenario in the bible that's the one jesus pursued so let me just be right there with you pursuing that family member so here they are you're allowing jesus to help you so when the satan looks at you it's like this thing is not going where i wanted it to go i'm losing control i'm losing the thoughts of that person i can no longer bombard them because that's been shut off for me and now here jesus christ is getting involved he's pursuing him holy spirit's pursuing him so his whole plan he can see his plan sinking by the day by the minute and let me tell you i would say full force every day for at least a week do this not all day all night but do this at least once a day and say all right i'm going to stand in the gap right now and declare and you understand first of all you're standing for the salvation you're coming against the the drugs and the effect they they have on them and then speak destiny into this person but there's one more thing you can do that is really powerful as you all know john 2 27 says that when you receive jesus christ as your savior you get a deposit of the anointing and that anointing lives in you you're never going to stop hearing me i'm never going to stop talking about the anointing the anointing breaks the yoke what yo the yoke of any kind of darkness it breaks the yolk uh jesus released it everywhere he went it was in the hem of his garment when that lady touches garment when you would go into places demons would run up because the anointing you carry but you get a deposit of that when you get born again it isn't just any anointing you need a deposit of him he steps inside of you but you also get to deposit that anointing anything this person owns or touches as a family member you have every opportunity to lay your hand on something they would wear i tell people anything they wear any doorknob and you don't have to do it in front of them this is covert remember covert with christ on their bed oh yes this works really well if you lay on their bed first cleanse it for the kingdom but if you lay on their bed and you begin to declare dreams and visions of their destiny with jesus guess what's going to happen and they may not tell you this they will begin in their sleep to have dreams of their destiny with jesus christ because the anointing is being released into that bed take your hand in their closet and just run across their clothes and say i release the anointing to break the yoke of darkness over them every time they wear something the anointing will be they'll be wearing the anointing and what food they're going to eat release it and i we've had people do this for three years in a row we've worked with people everywhere about releasing the anointing you create a cloud of the anointing it begins to even stay outside there's so much in you but this family member every time if you get to hug them just release the anointing just stay on your breath they release the anointing but when the anointing gets involved it brings it into a whole other level of battle i'm just telling you right now the anointing breaks the yoke of darkness and everywhere you release it where they sit where they sleep uh the refrigerator handle the door handles on on your home if they're still living there with you i tell people if they don't send no card saying i miss you release the anointing in the card uh in a text you want to send them i'm telling you i don't have my phone with me but it is so powerful it's like one of your greatest secret weapons why do you think he gave it to all of us and i tell people all the time you've been sitting on one of the greatest weapons they gave you sit in church every sunday and yet that deposit has never grown it's still in there the more you put out of the anointing the more it grows just like a deposit in the savings account the more you invest it you invest the anointing by releasing it i'm telling you then they're fighting stuff that's they're wearing that they're walking in it's fighting against the darkness the very darkness i can tell you what the demons will stop wanting to be around them just because they're being invaded by the anointing so there are things you can do nothing is hopeless okay not when jesus christ is involved it says remember all things are possible with god that thing yeah you are dangerous when you're born again and i know they don't teach you in church this but they should they should have classes uh like anointing classes or something somebody should start a class up and if you're listening right now you have the ability to start something why don't you start a class about john 2 27 about the anointing that abides in all of us that christ put that deposit in there and if you begin to use it you can change anything oh i have a quick story to tell people about why i said the shoes this is this is a true story and i went somewhere to speak and i was training i trained the whole church at one time on how to release the anointing you know how easy it is you just teach them to do it you read the scripture you tell them what the anointing is and and you get people to answer this question the anointing breaks uh and every christian will say the yoke but they don't know what that means okay then you explain it is it is the power of christ's anointing he operated in the more you release it i can go like this like i release i actually feel it not just coming from my hands but my whole body wow okay you're the wave of it every anointing out there to break any yoke of darkness in jesus name everybody's anointing to open up the passages uh to hear jesus christ better to know him better in jesus name the more you release it you will begin to feel it leave you which is why without even jesus looking and that woman touched the hem of his garment he said i felt virtue or i felt power leave me that was the anointing and so this story was really quick we had a report from somebody who kept steps meeting one time and said his brother all of a sudden became distant became hateful uh he didn't live with him but he lived he was just a real wealthy person in the city this was his brother was wealthy and all of a sudden he got caught off in the things became bitter and angry i couldn't stand his brother who was the believer and then he finally lost his business and he and he didn't have a job he didn't have money or anything but he always admired these cowboy boots that his brother owned and so his his wife and he kept praying about what to do about it and then they came to my meeting and they heard me share about releasing an anointing in the articles of things for the people so they decided they were going to do a covert operation with this brother of his who was looking for work he actually was a landscape architect and so he finally came to his brother and said i don't have any money can i mow your lawn he's an architect right and he wants to just mow the lawn to have food so they they had prayed over the boots the night before and left them but right inside the front door so when this guy left he had to pass those boots and i mean they laid their hands that released anointing that breaks a yoke of darkness according to first john 2 27 thank you for correcting me holy spirit first john 2 27 released that anointing they both did it in jesus name to break the yoke of darkness over my brother well sure enough he came he mowed the lawn and his brother said is there anything else i can do i really want to help you and he said no i don't need your help and then he looks over and there's those boots sitting right inside the front door and he goes well there is one thing i really like those boots and i need new shoes and his brother said well you may take them so he took those cowboy boots and i'm not i'm not exaggerating one week later this brother comes back saying i don't know why i've been so mean to you i'm so sorry he said i'm overwhelmed that these boots are the best thing i've ever owned when i'm wearing them he said i'm happy all the time and he said i was wondering would you pray with me just because of that i ask you he said would you pray with me and so they prayed with him and said god open doors for him you know uh to know you better to hear you better and to show that you love him give him something he had that's better that he had before three days later he shows back up still wearing the boots saying you're not gonna believe this he said i had an old client call me and i have been given all of these buildings at the building to design all the landscape for this whole entire development he said i'm going to make millions i mean he was like crying he said i'm giving myself back to jesus christ if he cares that much for me it's not worth it to hang on to the darkness and i can tell you what why did that happen because the anointing broke that yoke of darkness that was them and that's what they did they just reached out to him let him know that they care about him and so they were so overwhelmed about i used to tell a story a lot so overwhelmed that no one can convince them that the anointing doesn't work it does work and so that did now he's back at this guy's been in business for some time now and his business has only grown his landscape business is way beyond what he ever had before just what they prayed so don't give up on your family members even though they may sound crazy act crazy they may say they hate you i can tell you what that's the enemy speaking because somewhere inside of their spirit is still the all the deposits of the love you showed them and the love that they gave to you that's still somewhere in their soul don't give up on them don't stop declaring that they will be free but make sure you're sending holy spirit to pursue them because when you choose to love i love us in valentine's week yeah when you choose to love and not strike back even though they're being hateful and mean and you know i will say this don't ever stay in a dangerous situation you don't want i'm not telling you to do that if someone is being horribly violent raging violent uh you might have to call the police and that sounds hard but sometimes that's where people find jesus i'm telling you so i'm not saying that but i'm saying just in a situation where you know people have are involved in things that are wrong they're beginning to change them you can totally do that okay you take authority over the enemy who's doing this uh make sure you lose any fear from yourself so that you can have clarity in hearing what god has to say but i do know this is a thing that we have done our lives all of my family we've taught other people to do it so we've been involved in situations and other people or been told of them we know this works you are powerfully and wonderfully made as a believer and jesus will never leave you he will always be there with you so don't get angry at god because your family members decided to go rogue and go crazy you can do something about it do you covert with christ take authority over that darkness begin to have it pulled down in jesus name then begin to release the anointing into their life or into their things that they wear as they lay on if you buy them a coke release into the coke before you give it to them there's all kinds of things that you can do in different ways you can think of that that anointing as long as they're wearing it or near it will begin to break that yolk when people get trapped in something like that i pretty much know people who are there literally is a yoke put around them they carry a yoke it becomes a burden a dreadful burden it will drag them down that's why it's called a yoke and yet the anointing breaks every yoke it breaks the darkness and then begin to speak against the enemy that that they will be blinded that they will have their mouth shut and i've seen sometimes angels go up and they just go like this zip the demon's mouth and the spirit they can't even give thoughts to that person because once satan gets a hook in you every every time he can he'll have an opportunity to say horrible things crushing things against people against their family members and then you know what the devil will do then he'll beat them up with how cruel they were i mean you don't win at all with the enemy he'll use you okay and then he'll use yourself against you whatever he can do but there is power in the blood power in the word power in you as a believer in jesus christ release that anointing speak against the darkness don't my brother used to say don't let satan see you wince don't let satan see you step back let him see you go bowl me forward and who you are the authority jesus christ gave us and your family member will not miss being in heaven being with you in eternity and i've heard many people in heaven say thank you for not giving up on me thank you for not giving up for standing in the gap for me and i want to say one more thing when you begin to do that do not speak bad against your family remember like don't go telling people all the stuff they're doing right now well i paid for them but they're still doing this and now they're doing this you make the situation that's not a testimony by the way that's just a sad story a testimony is but you you have victory because of the blood of the lamb the victory and the word of your testimony is part of the victories how victory is created that's why i tell people in this time celebrate eat cake in the face of the enemy tell you piercing the heart of the enemy when he sees you not just being strong and faithful but actually still enjoying your life that god put you here for a purpose and your family member should not steal your joy steal your plans steal your future from you and me would like to take everybody down but i can tell you he's about to go down really hard the enemy is and so much stuff will be broken off people but you have authority especially over your family members even grandchildren who don't live with you you can take authority over the atmosphere they're living in it's in the army of heaven in there send holy spirit in there and every time you visit them make sure you release the anointing in their home and even without you being there this is the thing about the anointing it will never wear off and you can't wash them all and it will never get old that's good you'll never get old so that's why it says in the word first john 2 27 it abides in you there you go there you go now can i have just one question about this and then you'd said a number of times don't give up don't give up don't give up and which that's awesome to know that that's the that's the instruction and then at one point you said do it for at least a week do that do that um and so my question is kind of in the time factor deuce can two people seemingly do the same uh prophetic not just acts but they do that they send the host they send the anointing they do all those things and one person might get a breakthrough in a week and the next person might take six months or what would you say about that i would say absolutely it depends on the will of the person it depends on the nature and the will of that person if they're more even in the natural even in the natural before they got involved in this stuff if if they were really strong-willed person it might take a little bit longer for them them to give given to the holy spirit or given to the thoughts them that are being put in there by the army of heaven by their own angels you know once you break that stronghold off of somebody it does say that our weapons they are mighty to the pulling down of strongholds which tells you those strongholds are they're demonic beings trying to control the mind uh the appetite uh what they what people see what they watch what they get involved in that's what a stronghold is most people walk through the walks of the day and every now and then the enemy will come against them or something you know every now and then but then there's some people who god has a very divine destiny for that the enemy sets on purpose a stronghold which means several demonic beings are assigned to that person bombard them or drag them off into doing things get them upset get them angry when they are pulled down when they're pulled down away from them that impact that continual bombardment will stop it will stop it's very powerful to see that happen in the spirit so it's just knowing what to do yes because of the nature of a person or their will but this is what god says to me god says i love strong-willed people and i'll tell you why because they may be even on the wrong track but when i get them and i get them where i want them to be nobody or nothing will ever pull them off that track so knowing you have a strong-willed child that's probably god made them that way you may have to pay for a little bit more as they grow up in your shaping i tell people you're not raising children you're shaping souls for the kingdom uh the soul so much about the soul almost everything we go through that's why it's talked about it's called the heart because it's the core of your being your soul is actually inside your spirit man is part of it so your soul your spirit man and then your body you are a living soul and guess what what you say right now in your own life even in the next minutes what you say choose to say every day will impact your own soul and the soul of everybody around you so rather than yelling and screaming at your family members who are doing these crazy things it's so much more powerful just to say i can't approve of what you're doing and i know it's not right you need to consider what you're doing but i want you to know i love you it's always important to say that you love them because that begins to pierce the enemy the enemy does not want anyone to love and i'm not saying like is that i'm not saying that you they you should stand and let you be beat you up either i'm not saying that i'm saying one of your other greatest weapons is love it says in the bible it is the strongest thing god made and when you say i love you to people it actually goes to a special place in their soul and it will they will hear those words over and over and over even with the assault of the enemy that they the enemy at one point will not be able to convince that person that they are not loved and that is one of the number one weapons the enemy does is make you once you get you isolated to the drugs or the alcohol he'll begin to tell people nobody loves you nobody cares about you but if you've made deposits into that person that's what the holy spirit will begin bring back to their memories so it does matter what you say and it does matter what you do in your life because every day we either demonstrate the power of god or we demonstrate and manifest the assaults of the enemy against us and others and that's been very impactful to me when you've taught this and other people have taught this to not only you but yes where they'll say and some people will say well go to the courts of heaven and do business with god but then they'll say but don't come back and just start badmouthing the very people you were just praying and i'm thinking why didn't i think of that you know so because we're so tempted to say oh look what they're doing now yesterday they did you know but you're saying don't use those lips and and tonight well you're being double-minded right steve that's double-minded and it says if you're double-minded you will get what from the lord nothing nothing so don't bring all your all your efforts and you might not see anything like that day or the next day but i will promise you this there are things happening in the unseen realm that you cannot see that are so powerful and so crushing to the planes of the enemy number one they can't even they can't really believe that you're making a stand or you know how to make a stand because satan's pretty much done whatever you wanted to in this world that's coming to an end and actually will become isolated in in areas as i've spoken before because of the understanding of the body of christ number one coming together loving one another but operating the way god gave us the right to and christ gave us actually a commission to do the darkness will be pushed back i'm not saying it'd be wiped off it'd be pushed back and such freedom will come to operate in the gospel of the kingdom and in many other ways in our own lives that no one has experienced even in the past at all so understanding that you're made by god for a purpose and your words are very important to him and it says if you ask for something you do not doubt in your heart doubting is speaking against the very thing you just asked for so yeah your words are powerful your words are powerful it says you shall have whatsoever you say you should eat the food of your lips you know i could go down this long line of scriptures but those those it doesn't mean something so when you make a stand it says stand there for that means you're not gonna go back don't go back on what your declaration was even if they get meaner even if they get crazier you keep bombarding that's why i said at least once a week speak over this situation and if it's real serious i would say at least once a day i'm saying maybe take five minutes 10 minutes i'm not saying you have to pray all night long uh god can hear your words what you're doing is ruling it says that we are kings and priesthoods who are god will a king a spiritual king rules and around and one of the greatest realms is you have greater authority in the spirit standing and declaring over your family members than anyone else so make sure that you're not just you're standing but when you're standing you're ruling you're doing something about it by doing covert activity by declaring against the darkness you're not going to tolerate the actions against your family member that you've loved them you're standing for their salvation to be true and that they'll be with you in eternity these words are very powerful not just in your own life because every time you say them they go in your own soul and that gives you you build your faith it says it you know you build yourself up in most holy faith if you pray in tongues make sure you also spend part of that time praying in tongues for your family member but let me tell you jesus has not given up on them and i know that the word says he desires even the vilest sinner should be free he wants them free i know not everyone will be i just have to say that to you but give every chance possible for your family member and i'll say this even if they pass away and you don't get to hear from them that was not done in vain even in the spirit at that moment of death if you have made a stand for your family member jesus has keys and that's the keys of hell death and the grave and those keys give him permission to go into that place i'm not saying as they've been dead for months and years i'm not saying that i'm saying at that moment and all this going on around you like right now in your life you made the stand and god has every right to use the very words you made for your family member but if all you do is uh you know bash them all the time or you're given uh it says whatever is a good report that's what you give so if people say well what's going on with your crazy family remember now you go they're getting healed they're going to change in jesus name i'm making a stand you know and if they don't give up if they still want to go on around say why don't you take my hand and pray for them right now i promise you they won't hang around you to hear a good report yeah yeah that's really good cat that's thinking well we have uh other questions but this was the most important question today that we hit that was so important um let me ask this first one kind of as a cousin a little bit to what you've been saying but this woman named jan asks she works at a place where she hears she says i hear secular music all day long every day at my job obviously she has no choice in the matter she goes how can i guard my ear gates when it's playing what would you say to her oh there is so something so simple that you can do i do that even when i go into places you know you do very simple before you leave to go in there you say i lift up and do an action i lift up my shield of faith to quench every fiery dart of the enemy and the music even though your ear is here it will not enter into your soul uh this is something the holy spirit uh he took me um you know armor by a piece of armor uh even the scriptures about the armor this revelation on all that which is part of the spirit force stuff that you'll be getting uh the shield of faith you know you're you're shot with the the preparation the gospel piece these are powerful things to have we are in the army of god it says so it says to be a good soldier we are in the army of god on the earth we're his army on the earth he has an army he sends from heaven that's heaven's army that works together with us but you yourself you're in an army right now and you have weapons and part of the weapons are what you put on to wear but one of the most usable ones i use is that shield of faith if i'm going into a meeting where i know there's going to be a lot of unsafe people you know i don't want to go up there and slap them in their faces or use profanity more likely to not i would say excuse me but i can't let those words go into my soul now most people aren't going to argue with me if i say that you'd be surprised who does swear sometimes by the way profanity is hell's language just so you know that yeah it matters that you don't use it but like the but but the enemy does travel he uses music he uses uh and not all secular music is bad just so you know that everybody thinks if it's not bringing in the sheaves you probably don't even know what that is it would not bring questions our generation you know or i'm gonna fly you know i'll fly away please these are from these these songs from 50 years ago now maybe 60 years ago let's go back here but you know uh uh all the powerful and i can tell you having lived in that whole time frame of the 50s and the 60s and the 70s the 80s and 90s i've heard every level of christian music and you so much better off today than you were i remember i can't even remember the call letters of the one radio station we had in jacksonville that was christian it was country bless her heart it was powerful back then but i wanted to fly away and find something else to listen to but when you're in this situation and i can tell you what just so you know this um make sure you're not listening to new age music please don't play new age music know what you're listening to now if you get a choice yourself for what to listen to um let's just say i could use michael jackson's example he's in heaven whether you like it or not he does not sing the same songs you have to understand that you may like a artist this is important to say this you may like a recording artist you don't even know what's in the song they're singing if he was here right now he'd say please don't listen to the old music but some of those movies especially in the 60s they carry drug-related stuff in them they carry hidden messages in them if you're in a place where you can't stop that please say i lift up my shield of faith that will quench every fiery dart of the enemy in this music and it will not affect me if you want to if you want to know the full thing to say but remember to lift up your shield of faith literally in the spirit you have a shield because of what covers up your soul and and nothing anybody's saying will penetrate that but that isn't a one-time thing okay every day is a new day it talks about a new day uh but there's some times that i actually use that shield of faith and i'll walk out of a place knowing none of that stuff stayed in me so that is what you need to do if you're working in a place where they play stuff over the over the music system whatever that is and now they can play just back in the day they had piped in music that was they called elevator music yeah yeah sleep probably not you but today with their ability to play anything anywhere you go even songs you would never play the step you feel the face it will crunch every one of those words or hidden agendas in those words or the songs that would try to affect you that's good i want to ask the question i had asked robin about celebrities as hollywood actors and got to give me a prophetic dream he even named this specific actress you know who it is in fact i'll just tell you who it was it was it's gal gadot who does wonder one well god told me in this dream that she was she had an experience is in the middle of experience of seeking god now that may take a generation for her to to receive but god god gave me that as a share so my question is well while we watched these uh and see these actors and actresses and robin had made a point the other day that in our generation all the actors knew god they just might have chosen not to serve him but they knew him or they knew who he was he said this generation of actors must have never even heard the story of god and they have to be taught that first so my question is how do everything we've been talking about the anointing obviously most people watching this don't have any you know they can't give cowboy boots or they can't give a card what uh what what would you instruct people who i know there's a lot of people who who feel called to pray for for many of those well-known uh actors or celebrities or those who work with them how would they go about interceding or declaring or decreeing for those that god puts on their heart i would definitely the first thing yeah there's actually some that i pray for all the time and because actually just so you know this there is a group in hollywood who for 45 years have had a list of actors and actresses that they they as a group pray for uh even this this group of people aren't just in hollywood there are many places there's hundreds and hundreds of people that pray over this list and they actually call out their name it's important to always call out the name when you're praying for somebody uh i know barbara i don't want to say her last name i don't know you know how much we're allowed to say about people or whatever but on this list are very well known directors people in the movie industry it's hollywood right so there's directors the scriptwriters screenwriters actors actresses people who do special effects there's a list of all these people god gave them those gifts he made them that gift and that's why they're powerful that's why they're good but he does want them to know him and i would say the most important thing you do is declare those very words we'll just use mickey mouse as an example by the way walt disney isn't heaven people awesome awesome that's great so i always tell people people mickey mouse made it to heaven that's good so we'll just use mickey mouse right you would say father i just declare mickey mouse will know jesus christ i declare he'll know him he'll become a christian uh that he will not lose the destiny he was chosen for in jesus name and i come against all the power of hell that is kept in bondage i release the anointing into that situation that that yoke will be broken off of them and i think this is pretty much what most of the people do that pray over a lot of people uh these most people are known uh some of them are not very good at all and i will say this people who are a gift or have a powerful gift the only reason they put up dark content is because that is what's inside of them god said i made them a gift they're the people who are cold he said hot or cold or whether you have to be hot or cold if you lukewarm i can't use you which means i'll spew you out of my mouth huh is a believer operating in the gift he gave you on purp and that doesn't mean i mean that could be a baker not just a singer or a preacher or a five-fold ministry whatever he made you as a that gift he gave you you are a gift every good and perfect gift that's us comes down from the father of lights we were the little lights the spirits living inside of him and that's what that means that's revelation but but we have the right because we are representing jesus christ in this earth to declare over certain people of course always so you have to pray first and take authority over the darkness consuming them because obviously it is consuming him that they'll be free from that release the anointing on their behalf so i release the anointing on behalf of mickey mouse or barbara or whoever else is out there uh you know that that they will know jesus christ because your words are powerful they create something in the spirit realm uh whether you're related to people or not i know we did talk mainly about family members but this is true for anybody and i've seen some of these people in heaven that people had on this list to pray for so yes you make a difference you absolutely make a difference and and like uh mainly what happens in hollywood the way they operated in the past was they would find people who are highly gifted get them involved in hollywood get them on drugs get them on alcohol the first thing they would want to do is pull christ away from them if they were a christian they certainly don't want that scene or known if they're popular and well liked they don't want them to be drawn to that part of that person although there are some really good actors and actresses unless we can say it on both sides that are born again and are still making an impact in hollywood um uh who never even got caught into the darkness once again if you want to send somebody there and it's your child you better be going with them okay you better not let just have your child go and be involved in the area of that situation just because it looks good for their good for their destiny or something like that you don't want that to be taken or ruined or spoiled so make sure that's covered to make sure that jesus is involved and and i i i talk to people quite often about that they've had a door open for them with a certain situation or this group and yet they're wicked you don't want to go there god's not feeding you to the devil okay he didn't give you that gift you do what you can with it for others or use it for him in any way you can but don't sell out thinking you can impact them with that gift 99 of the time that is not what happened and i mean i've sat in a shop in hollywood i saw the warlocks and witches sitting in this place with groups of young people influencing them and and saying things over them and when i walked in that door they all turned and looked at me really i didn't see anything it was a starbucks i walked in because it was the only place i'd get a hot chocolate but i know if i'm going to that place i'm going to do destruction to the enemy i walked in that door and there was a warlock sitting at this table these young girls they probably were like 17 18 years old wanted me actresses and he was mentoring them and i walked in that door ooh i just began i released the anointing like this cloud started coming out of me and instantly he came and he he sat there turned his head and looked like directly at me like that and i would not look down i kept releasing anointing the whole entire time good for you i mean if you're born on me like a river wow you know he did he turned around like this he dropped his eyes he couldn't say anything to the girls because of the presence of god that was in that place and everyone in there who was a wicked walked out wow that's amazing in line with me and some of them were were actors but they were like wrestlemania people yeah but they were believers they had a lot i'm not saying every one of them are but this these three kinds were huge their arms are huge and they were looking around like now they were disgusted uh they were disgusted because most people who who live or or work in hollywood understand that's just what the enemy does but they were big they didn't want to say nothing to this guy they they didn't know what he would say back i didn't care and all i did was release the anointing and i was speaking under my breath and all i know was he could not even look up he couldn't move he couldn't say anything the whole time i was and i was declaring over all those girls breaking under my breath breaking the yolk of diamonds over every single one of them you know that they would be free from that they've been stepping into their destiny and these guys could hear what i was saying oh you were saying that louder you were saying it loud enough to actually i was thinking you know well the guy was kind across the whole room but you know i was just saying father i take power over all the power of the enemy trying to affect these girls in jesus name i break that yoke of darkness over them in jesus name and i look and here's this guy sitting next to me he's got the biggest grin on him he's shaking his head yeah yeah so you can be a light no matter where you go and god had margaret stop and i said margaret you i got to go in that shop you know to get me it wasn't for my hot chocolate it was because of the impact that would make over those girls lives and i know it was when they left there were little darts in them that had the light of god on them and so you make a difference by the way you live your life but i'm not tolerating darkness anywhere near me and that should be something you say when you wake up in the morning okay i will not tolerate darkness operating around me against me against my family in jesus name because that's called ruling and you're taking authority in the spirit realm before you even get anywhere and it says you know if you submit yourself under the hand of god and you resist the devil guess what i'm doing i'm resisting him by saying those words guess what he flees from you yeah kat that the whole thing about ruling is very interesting because all through my years and i'm 66 now but i was here teaching after teaching about you don't know what authority you have in christ and they would say you don't know the authority you have a christ you know you have more authority but nobody ever until i met you let's just say it that way said you take this authority and you rule with it i don't yes because i never got up expecting to rule that day and i believe you do am i is that true you get up expecting to rule i do i go i rule before i go to bed and when i get in the morning i'm going to rule well guess what if you're a king let's just say in the natural you're a king do you ignore your realm that you live in you let an enemy come in and take over and harm people or do things do you let them come in and steal your stuff no you are a king unto your god it says you will rule jesus christ now in this lifetime and in the times to come it is up to you to decide do you want to take authority do you want to be dangerous against hell i don't care if you're 14 years old sitting in a room somewhere you're a believer you have the right to rule by what you say and by the choices you make yourself you can't go play in the enemy's camp why are you walking in there giving him ammunition against you you're a strong believer you know you go to church you give your times you help people you love people but what are you doing beside that okay you you take these levels of authority it says that it says the violent take it by force from the enemy that doesn't mean you have spears and guns and are killing people that means you're ruling with the words you choose to take the authority that the bible gives you that jesus gives you and you're speaking them into the spirit realm where that's where you rule we can't go in this physical realm that's what most people want to do they like to go wipe everybody out and just get rid of them but you know it doesn't matter if you get rid of the people the evil presence the demonic are going to stay right where they are doing what they want to unless we decide to take authority everywhere we go and you're right i expect it to happen i expect the enemy to run i expect him to let go expect him to be to be harmed and crushed and pushed back that's why we have light in us and when i see people with light blinding out of them i know that they're ruling it's not about how old you are what church you go to it depends on are you a blood-bought believer of jesus christ that you have the right to not tolerate darkness and whatever you do don't participate with it there's a difference in participation and toleration you're not tolerating it yet you'll go into places and watch already movies and stuff you shouldn't be you're going into the camp of the enemy you're trying to take authority over do you think they're going to listen to you you can't play with the darkness and then try to rule over it it says you have to be free free of all that stuff when jesus stood there and said to them there's none of him in me that was jesus saying there's none of the devil in me there's no darkness in me there's no sin in me why because he chose to live that way well pal wow cat wow you know i could ask other questions but i want to leave it at this point i don't want i want that to sink in because you know we've got to learn to rule we got to learn to do what you're teaching us to do and you know me i'm not just blowing smoke i actually mean that when i say that i am hearing every word you're saying and goodness gracious we need to learn to rule we're kings to our god i don't think in cat i don't think we've been trained i was never trained that we're kings and to our god in the scripture the scripture says we're kings and priests unto our god and you go okay that's nice we're kings and that's all it ever was was a nice sounding scripture it didn't carry jesus did share the gospel but what he talked about mostly was the gospel of the kingdom a spiritual kingdom that the king of kings and lord of lords those spiritual kings and those spiritual lords rule in that kingdom in that spiritual kingdom that's what he came to bring yes he came for our salvation but he came for even more than that he expects us to take authority over this darkness by all that he gave us and if you sit in a corner and stay afraid because fear is the enemy's greatest weapon and all i have to say is i choose to break that fear off of me in jesus name i choose to break all deception off of me i will not tolerate it being a part of my life anymore i'm running my race with jesus christ i will rule and reign with him in this world i will not let anything penetrate where i live or where he sends me or control me in any way because i serve the living god and i will serve no other and father right now i pray for everyone watching right now that they be free from fear free from deception free from confusion in jesus name and i speak the life of god the plans of god the power of god let them have revelation and live and rule and reign with you in this lifetime to make those generations coming after them even more powerful in the spirit until there's a generation that will not bow their knee bow their words to the enemy but we as long as we're here will be a threat and a danger to the plains of the enemy that they will fail fail fail and only what jesus christ wants is what will be in jesus name amen wow wildcat thank you thank you what an amazing day what an amazing teaching and i'm like i said i'm not blowing smoke i'm really mad and make sure you're having fun yeah you will become weary if all you're doing is pedaling you need to have fun in your life that's good because you need a balance on earth as it is in heaven heaven is fifty percent fun fifty percent off and splendor and amazing father son and holy spirit he has a plan for you and you choose to take that plan and start even this very moment making a difference with your life amen amen amen well cat i want people to get your books you've got two books that are done i think uh and you're working on the third if i'm saying that right tell people i see revealing heaven.com is that where they get your books yes uh here's my book too right here it says number two on it it also has the wing of the living creature that's when my whole head was pink they're so it was so pink ridiculous yeah revealing heaven one and two um you can go well you can go to our uh reelingham.com that's our own store and that's where we show our events and that's where all of our products are like the i don't do demons cup i don't do demons with a lightning bolt that took them out of heaven and so that's what our commission is it is to reveal and create heaven on earth and my greatest desire is to bless my king jesus christ he is my number one above all else and what he says is what i say and what he does is what i do and that is my my desire for you is to be so free of any fear or anything holding you back you were made for a purpose in this world and he chose and timed your birth on the earth you're not you are not a mistake and remember he holds us in his hands and we will all if your desire is to fulfill that purpose he has for you make sure when he asks you to do something you do it okay i have katper.com that's a spiritual platform where you can get all kinds of uh uh revelation and there's uh q a sessions i think there's probably some interviews on there we're about to upgrade that one to have a lot more content but um and it's the only place you can give online i always tell people don't believe these fake places out there saying it's me asking for money for some country or for some project or plan or something that's not me okay now i do want to say something if i travel i personally never charge people to hear the revelation that god has me give not in any of our own meetings we usually have four meetings a year in our own city and there's never going to be a charge to come but if i'm invited by another ministry or place to come and speak for them they may charge a fee and let me tell you if a thousand people are coming to their place that means they have to hire more security more ushers more people to clean up more people in the parking lot and they have a right to charge that fee yeah so that's not that's not me saying i'm not going to charge in another location if they have to charge a small fee to register that's probably also to make sure you have a seat and they don't have 300 people saying they're coming and they're not so the gospel salvation is free but it does cost money to preach and have a place to keep it and present it and i just want to clear that up uh so but i myself god won't let me charge you or this revelation is freely given because it's from the father from the son from the holy spirit just make sure you're loving somebody every day and i love what somebody said i remember what they said at least one person in a day make them laugh it's so powerful in the spirit laughing in the spirit laughing is a weapon also joy and laughter is a weapon that's good cat oh man i just want to stand up and applaud you thank you this was amazing a quick reminder folks that tim sheets is on tomorrow we have had him on one other time before i think but he's very very good he's got some real good revelation from the lord about these specific days we're in thank you again cat over and over and over god bless you we will see you all again tomorrow bye [Music] [Music] [Applause] i

of the of the year year and a half however long we've been doing this a year in a few months but uh it takes a long time to get them all in there so we appreciate your patience and letting us get to them when we can so let's see a quick reminder to be sure you subscribe to elijah.com mainly so that after the show we will then send the show to your inbox so you can send it to others uh we put it in the email and we put the links and the pictures and the intro and all that and the title of the show and then it's you can send it to friends really quickly rather than try and figure out how to tell them to watch it and giving them the link so this that helps a lot so we really encourage you to do that um we haven't told you how to subscribe to the youtube channel for a long time so i will mention that so you go to youtube.com and in their search box you type in live streams either one or two words and when it comes up along the bottom you'll see this click the thumbs up the red

babysitting our granddaughter as she does one day a week and at their place and it's a fun day for her but on those days you'll know when dreams aren't here because this thing's dude usually she pins it back there for me and then she goes on a walk and listens to the show while she walks but um not to not on not when she's doing babysitting so you'll know this is the hat this is the truth if steve's cord is hanging he'll know doreen's gone so that's the big reveal today all right well listen let's bring in our friend kat kerr here hey cat hi there so good to see you as always yes it's good to see you doing so much better i'm very excited for you that you are doing something like that yeah it was intense you know a lot of people were saying when that omicron i can't prove it was a homocrime because they don't have a test that tells you if it's own crime they just so i never took a test but they would say it was mild well it wasn't mild for me and i i had literally thought i had skipped around all of these i wasn't getting it nothing you know i was in a lot of things but you know i got it but uh we've got through it as i've told people i'm now 10 pounds lighter and now i'm going to keep this weight so that's just that yeah that was hard weight loss i always call that god's weight loss program yeah it was i mean one benefit that came out of it steve they're ten thousand people so you know what and there and there's other little things like you hear people that they had near death not that i was that way but after i was coming back and then the sun here in the northwest we don't get a lot of sun in the wintertime but god gave us extra sunlight even today and i found myself praising god i wasn't one to always thank him for the son i mean yeah i'm grateful for but now oh thank you lord thank you lord i mean my gratitude quotient whatever we call that is much higher after this i'm just a much more grateful person awesome so it's important really to feel gratitude one time i remember uh the father talked to me for almost half a day and this was probably 15 years ago he talked about gratitude and he says so much of the body don't even show gratitude and from that day i have on purpose uh shown gratitude and thanks for almost anything really anything new especially but just for the everyday things i thank him that i'm here that he chose me and i get to know all these people and i thank him for whatever little bit of food i eat especially if it's chocolate well you know i'm drink this is something that i experimented after again when i was realizing gratitude was coming to the surface i started saying you know dream my wife drain is very good at asking the lord for a good parking space let's see she's at costco and that's a massive parking lot yeah and i'm thinking well i don't know if god is going to get that involved and i'm not a negative nelly i just think i just haven't done that and i watch it keeps happening to her so i find it the other day i got up and i i didn't have a because i don't go that many places we live on 20 acres and it's a big old farmhouse we're not coop but i i be the the sun wasn't coming through and i said you know what lord here's what i'm going to ask you to do today because you do this for dream all the time i just want you to part the clouds because we are only we're going to have clouds no sun the whole day and let the sun come on over this farm house and you know darn it if that's not the right word but i mean god did it about halfway through the day the the cloud split and we had some it was not in the forecast there was no sun and i started saying god that was you i know that was you you and i stopped out you know she's trained me a lot about little things and asking does not mind blessing us even in the simple things we're we're usually so focused on making sure that everything's taken care of well let's just say the essentials uh you know our bills are paid and we have food and stuff like that a lot of people they they need those things and they do thank god for those but you know you can ask for other things i ask for fun all the time i say give me a fun day or let me have fun or i want to laugh a lot today or i'm looking for something special help me find it and he will give you good parking spots all the time if you ask well no i'm really becoming an absolute believer the other thing is i learned this from you cat once you identified holy spirit as the drama king that heaven calls him that i ask him for drama all the time and i'll say not bad drama good drama surprisingly do something and i i do that and dreams learning from me on that so we're teaching each other you know but yeah that's great for some reason that was easier for me to ask don't ask me why but you know well anyway cat we're here we've got a lot of questions but do you uh have a few thoughts to share with us about current events or anything that's on your mind before we get into the questions so i'll just turn that over to you if you've got anything to share i just know the father's been saying start making plans for what your future is um you don't have to wait this whole thing just what i don't care if you call it flip i don't care what you call it uh restoration whatever god is in the business of doing that and i know i can tell you that from what he's doing with me what he's doing with me is my mind is shifting from all the stuff that is still around me into the very near future and he has me talk about the future to him and to many other people i'm always talking about the future which is like right around the corner i'm not talking about five years ten fifty a hundred years from now i could talk about all those things but it's like right now what's about to happen in our lives is going to reflect and for everyone else when we move you better watch for a wave of acceleration you've never seen before in your life because the father is saying i need you in that place i need you there acceleration is so close right now we're literally packing day and night we have help help in this pack so that we can move out of here because of what is coming which is god which is good it's the good stuff that's coming people it's not all the demon gloom and things people have been saying would happen it's not that and i'm not this is the thing that god has me say i am not ignorant to any activities of hell i'm just not going to advertise them okay i will advertise what the father said the other day though about the devil is he's about to get the worst blow he's ever experienced from his existence and he said he's going to be crushed and pushed back so far from all the stuff going on and he is behind all of that i mean people willingly have to say yes and they do which is still mind-boggling me uh willing to accept what's going on is okay or right in another one of those god doesn't say it's okay it's totally wrong it's evil it's wicked and god is dealing with it so we who are still here on the earth can run our race with such acceleration with no no contending for anything when you step into a season of acceleration and extravagance you can't leave the extravagance out i know people have done without or lost things but in this season you're about to step into it is going to be extravagance all the way wow wow and he says the devil is going to take the biggest hit he's ever had because he's lost part of his brain from the lightning bolt that hit him when god sent him out of heaven and he does say that to me all the time he doesn't think straight he knows he has a plan he gets it fully going and the foundation is crumbling as he adds layers of evil and wickedness the foundation he thought he had is crumbling so nothing is going to stay and there's no way this whole plan of what's going on there's no way it could possibly remain number one it's in the wrong season and you can't pick a season and push it ahead of god's plans you can't do that and the devil still has not learned that's why he keeps failing in this whole thing i would like to say is going to fail miserably on behalf of the wicked and so the father said that to me the other day he's about to be hit so hard it's going to be a long time before he recovers or could even try to push his agenda for the socialism and communism because nobody is going to want after having gone through this this stuff so i can say one report that's a god report not my own the enemy's about to take the biggest hit he's ever seen so anybody running around participating with all this stuff you better get back in on the path you're supposed to be on i want to ask you a question about that because we know that there's people have different faiths of when they think things are going to wrap up you know pre-trib midterm post trip and you and i don't worry about that much mainly because i'm listening to you and you said god has taken you into the future a hundred years yes and the the the perilous times had not even come yet so here's my this is a question it's not on my list but i have relatives a lot of them uh and different faiths i mean they're christians but they're different brands that what i would say but so most of them are convinced that things are wrapping up because it's so evil it's so bad some of them have guns some of them don't but they just say this is it so when you're describing that the devil's about to take a hit that like he's never taken before maybe since the time of the cross is it going to be so obvious that god brought justice on the earth that even those who are ready to see this wrap up will say oh will they just get it will they say oh i see this is not that time well i don't see how they could not get it steve it'll be so drastically different that it'll be this is how drastically different it will be people will be seeking out christians to have them as friends wow wow they will be bashing them falsely judging them uh they won't be pushing you know uh false religions or witchcraft witchcraft is also about to take a big hit right along with satan and uh and that's not going to be heard of for quite a while as you know very last days that will change but we're not there people if you just read the bible and figure out either god or jesus said the very things that have not happened yet he's not willing to change his mind because a little devil thinks he can take over and i can tell you that's what he is we give him too much power and even thought because the devil wants you to talk about him and how bad it is rather than the power and the glory of god which is about to just blind the enemy and wickedness around this world the glory has not come from us yet okay the baptism in fire has not happened i trust me you won't have to say did i get it it's like a blow torch hitting you and wipes all the fear of the enemy any doubt you ever had filled you with boldness and you won't be the same that has not happened okay the glory of the lord has not covered this earth like the waters cover the sea you don't know what the glory is so you don't understand not only do we create it for him and we give it back he lets us carry it and impart it like shockwaves into this world that has not happened okay and this is the number one thing the bible says the world will know us the body of christ by our love for each other very clearly that is not happening right now so god said i am not willing to ditch my plan so maybe man in their own understanding of what they have assumed or even researched or thought they had the dates no one knows but the father he says i am not done with anything yet well now you know that the scripture you just quoted i had not heard it um interpreted the way you did because i think i was taught or assumed that what god was saying is the glory of the lord covers the earth as the waters come with the sea i thought okay so god's saying if we were in tune with him if we really opened our eyes we would see right now the glory of the god covering the face of the earth as water cover the sea that's not what you're saying is it no that's not revelation that's what's written that's not what that means and if people even thought or considered the great things that have been said by father son or holy spirit themselves are the things that will assure you will happen and i can tell you why it has not happened the glory is evident it's light coming from you are you looking at each other with light blinding out of you that the enemy is terrified of are you imparting it in shock waves uh that will will change things will change cities will change places you go to nothing can stand before the glory and win and that is an event those are events these are events that god calls moves of god that will bring a habitation of heaven to the earth so we're not even talking about one or two things happening these things have not happened but you can understand why god i'm sorry i'm talking fast i'm excited when you have seen it it's different than thinking about it or reading words and you go well that sounds exciting no people it's what you will be doing you are a part of this why because christ in you is the hope of glory that glory the light and the power of god is what the glory is it blinds the enemy it makes you so bold you can't even hardly hold still that everybody will run you to say why are you filled with light what is this all about why do i feel like god's presence is here is that happening i'm not talking about two or three people these are waves moves of god now the baptism and fire literally there's a difference in baptism and fire and carrying the glory yeah it'll cover the earth because we'll take it there okay the reason why like the waters come to see is there's two thirds water one third earth that's showing you this will not be a little small thing that will be happening on the years and actually our 2021 calendar was all about the moods of god coming on the earth i think we still have some lust left i think we're selling them at a discount but you might check and find it out but literally that calendar was about the moves of god coming it clearly explains baptism and fire even what it looks like what happens when you're baptizing fire it talks about the move of god called the glory covering the earth we get to carry it and people go we can't do that then why is christ in you the hope of glory why would he say that yeah why would he say that the fire of god literally is like blue fire that sits on you that burns in you and the more you release it and use it for him the greater it gets just like the anointing that you carry in first john 2 27 there's a scripture for all you people that think i don't know the bible by the way i was reading this morning first john 2 27 is your first weapon he ever gave you is called the anointing that doesn't just break the yoke but destroys the yoke the yoke of darkness it destroys it you have it jesus put it in you and you got born again and the more you give it out the more you get this why it's called a deposit to you create a cloud of the anointing and when you walk past people they'll be healed just like peter that's what happened to peter that is going to be such a major thing and god would tell me they're sitting there on the pews not knowing the power they have in them even though it's in the word and and it talks about the it talks about the anointing all through the bible it was in jesus garment and they said well he was the son of god yes but we can carry he gave us a deposit of that anointing and it lives it says it abides in you and you know what's good about the anointing it doesn't wear off and it won't wash off you can put it on every endeavor send every text you send i thought i'm gonna have my phone here and put the anointing in it and it breaks and destroys the yoke of darkness so i'm telling you a little bit about spirit force right now anyway but these are things that will happen on the earth and they have not happened anything because some little weenie person who thinks they are our president this stole it all thinks he spells it all stealers and liars are friars i'm telling you what right now in hell if i ever heard lies coming out of somebody's mouth it's been one after another liars are friars sorry people that's what the bible says and so but god is not ending it all with his son this is what his own words are i will not end it all with my son having a weak pathetic testimony of the blood he shed on calvary that gives us power over all the power of the enemy i'm not doing it so good and and um cat should people be because you know ruth hepflin taught about the glory i did i've not read her books but i've heard that you know she'd praise and and this and that until the glory comes and i've heard my friend david um oh i can never think of his last name uh but he's he he says people get healed so easily in the glory and i guess he's one of those you know david herzog thank you julie uh and he he always welcomes the glory of god and apparently he feels it and sees it um he's probably more of a seer like you are and i i i'm not quite that much but um are people supposed to be seeking the glory or just waiting for god to bring it when it's time what's your thoughts the thing you should seek is baptism and fire that's actually something you can seek the glory is something that's created by your own life christ in you is the hope of glory the hope that you will create glory for him by the choices you make the words you take authority in that creates glory for him okay but you know i know i used to say i give it all back to you i would give it all back to me said yes but you have to carry it and you will begin i'll look at people i would see more light coming out of some than others and i thought well that's because they're saved but what i was seeing was the glory that had accumulated in their life and there will come a time when we literally began to release it it happened to me one time i wasn't even ready for it and i didn't ask for it but i was talking about it and let me tell you how you get to do these things you have to talk about them like you actually believe it is real baptism and fire is something that will happen and it will happen randomly then it's going to happen in mass and let me tell you what he's not going to take that away either the the fire is like in the book of acts and made the people bold they were hiding before they didn't want to be seen or known and yet when the fire came on them along with the baptism the holy spirit when the fire came on them you literally they saw it on their heads so they did see it it's a spiritual fire and it comes from the heart of the father that's where it's sent from is sent from his very being and there's angels some of the angels will be be a part of carrying the fire down and it will come down and it will come upon us the glory is different i understand about creating an atmosphere of glory i understand what david's talking about and even roots i understand that but this thing that's talking about in the bible that the knowledge and understanding and knowing of so you got to understand what does that word understand mean that means you will know what it is uh the understanding and knowing of the glory of god is going to come over this earth and it will come from us and it will cover this earth like the waters come to see two thirds of the earth i believe that's what he's saying well people will have uh created so much glory for him you'll be able to see the light in them you'll be able to see the light in them the fire comes on you like flames of fire on your head uh sometimes i see fire coming out of people's hands uh um i have had a measure of baptism and fire a very small measure you only think you've had a small measure cat really i would have think yeah you know measures of things sometimes just so i can experience it and i can tell people this thing is real and you're not going to run around saying did i get baptized in fire you'll know nothing happened to me and i had been seeking baptism and fire because i a friend of mine had got baptism in fire and uh and he had been seeking god about he came and told me he walked in the door and what is different about you why why do you have fire around you what is that fire and i could even feel like the heat of god uh coming from him and he couldn't stop grinning goes i i gotta measure the baptism in fire and i said i'm going for it i wanted to um be able to demonstrate that for god and i went down front they were having a service in our church and i don't normally go down front unless i'm told by god to go down front and so they called for people this is a church of 4 000 members back in the day anyone who thinks they're in the ministry or our leaders you tell this is some time ago come forward i'm thinking that's not me this is before the whole having things started this is before the heaven thing started that that was in 1989 when the heaven thing started so this was before that time and i have been adamantly saying it's in the word my my friend cliff got pat in the fire you know respective persons you know i'm desiring i really desired it more than eating or sleep i wanted it really and so but on this day it's still about obedience he said to come down and come forward to have hands laid on you to release you into you know ministry or or leadership or whatever well i knew that i was never gonna be a pastor i knew he'd never call me to be a pastor and uh and i didn't go down and boy the holy spirit started bombarding me get down there get down there you get down there and i'm like and i wasn't arguing with him but i was making statements like i'm not a leader he said yes you are and she said i'm not in the ministry he said that doesn't matter you are going to be a leader or a major leader get down there right now he's going to make sure he didn't miss it because he's my best friend so i walked down there you know just walked down and the whole line he kind of dissipated and i walked down front and uh pastor zink i know he will never forget this day neither will i he walked up now he was the carrier of the fire he laid his hand on me and the fire of god came out of his hand it hit me so hard i knocked i was sown against the usher and we were throwing three rows back into the company really cat wow it was so powerful it felt like a blowtorch coming in it burned everything off the walls of my heart it talks about in the bible that he he'll uh make white the walls of your of your heart it burnt everything out i mean i wouldn't have sinned in here but whatever was in there was burnt out and i was so on fire i fell then i fell in the aisle and i lay there for nine and a half hours they locked your hands my body began to shake and two angels came and caught me up uh in the spirit and took me back in time it was like i was flying through time still filled with this fire it was so burning me and when we stopped when we stopped my feet hit the ground i was outside the tomb of christ and he had come out of the tomb and was in the garden really i was there at the time this was happening because you know god time comes from him people it comes from him i'm not the only one who's had encounters there but because i was willing you see that i was hungry i sought what i wanted and then when the time came if i had not gone down i believe i would have not ever gotten it uh but because i obeyed and no one forgets the day that that happened and somebody when the service was over and the pastor is so smart he would not let them touch me because my body vibrated the whole time there were two angels that stayed with my body now my spirit man wasn't there and they go how can you be be alive well if probably a layer of me he took i don't want to explain that right now okay took a layer of myself yeah that's still you people you've got layers of yourself inside of you there's just too much to share in a meeting anyway so i my body was laying there but literally just like this show like in star wars how all those lights come toward you i knew i was flying i did not know it was going through time and it was so rapidly all i could see were lights and literally i felt my feet touch the ground uh and when that when when that vision cleared the light was gone i knew where i was i had never been a new throat but i knew that that was the tomb the stone had been rolled away um the two angels were there and i think mary had gone inside because i saw this whole scene mary went in had been in one side and um and then she comes out i watched it i just watched the whole thing and i saw jesus with his back turned in the flowers he was smelling the flowers people he loves flowers he was in the garden right outside the tomb that's why i know that's the right one i saw it before and then mary comes out and she goes can you tell me where they have taken him she thought he was the gardener right he was in the flower bed he wasn't on the path he literally stepped in the flower bed uh right there by the tomb and was smelling the flowers the minute he turned and he said something she knew it was him and so that's why i give i can give revelation and clarity on that whole thing that happened that then me see when he was down letting me see those same joint just took me caught me up and brought me back excuse me brought me back through time literally traveled the time and uh and then when we stopped uh when they stopped my body my body sat up i was in the church there was a security card i saw him sitting over there i looked there was a note stuffed in my sleeve and i pulled out and my daughter said when she wakes up call my dad here's the number [Laughter] wow and and for two weeks i couldn't speak english really i could not speak english i only could speak in tongues when i tried to open my mouth and uh and in those two weeks after that he kept showing me things like he kept showing me um like the not the perils times but the glory days that are going to be on the earth uh he started back way back then showing me things he showed me things that will happen like um one judgment begins to come to the body and the leadership i i saw i had a vision i had a vision and uh i was taken forward in time i don't know how far in time but i saw the fire begin to fall on people first then it's going to fall on buildings and places and that fire will begin to expose or empower people in mass i saw pastors who had taught well and taught what was truth i saw them everyone was thrown to the floor in this church everybody even the pastor and he was trying to speak in the microphone as he was laying down he couldn't move because the glory uh the glory and the fire was so heavy on him and then he'd take me to another place and show me other places and he took me to this one place where this pastor had been deceiving people i'm not i didn't know this person but this this was something that will actually happen i saw he doesn't show me maybe things he doesn't show me things that represent something he shows me the literal thing i saw this pastor who had been lying and cheating and doing all kinds of unclean things and thought he was okay that pastor dropped dead and people crawled because they couldn't this is at the same time this happened they crawled forward and dragged him off the off the platform and dragged him out because they couldn't stand up and i heard the voice of god said i will appoint him and everybody knew who that him was that him crawled up to the platform god said this is your pastor and i'm saying if you think god's not going to divinely do things you better think twice he is still god he has a plan for this earth and these these days i was seeing was glory it was glory days baptism and fire days so it will be different in those days like in ice and sapphira i do believe that it will be an instantaneous thing that will happen people have been lying and telling people lies saying they represent god they will not get away with it in those days coming so we're not done we're not anywhere near done uh and like i said i've been taking over 100 years into the future he's also taken me into the past like at the tomb uh when he made the earth i got to see that so nobody can tell me this is not real i'm i'm not going to believe it because i've seen the living god i've seen his son holy spirit i've seen his image and uh he chose me i didn't choose myself to reveal heaven he did and um so let me tell you there's a lot of accountability in him and i i'm very careful about every word i say that if it's him i'll say it i can't do panels i can't discuss what other people think or say god didn't tell me those things so i don't invite me to be part of a panel i can only say what god said to me and tell you what he showed me yeah i've seen that i'm going to ask you a question you may not know the answer this but whatever pastor that was is suddenly dropped dead do you happen to know was he lost did he go home early what do you or do you have any idea was he i do know that sometimes god will take somebody before he'll let them go to hell um okay and if they weren't living right and they dropped dead they probably had that moment of when they died that probably faced christ okay uh for for to see if he is going to hell or not okay okay that's good so i didn't know that part i only know that he was showing me that when he says he will judge the church first he meant it yeah and i know people say well judgment is here no this stuff is happening isn't judgment against us it's judgment against the evil the ones being judged now is the evil so that the glory and the power of god and those who god has picked or anybody who chooses to can freely move around and not be kind you know not arrested or made fun of or made points up no people will be running in these days when this whole thing happens he's about to do people's minds and hearts will be drawn to god to know him to know christ and we're entering into a whole new way of living on this earth and people think it's all over well if you want to die and go to heaven you go right ahead i'm not going anywhere and you don't let me go because i'm not going to miss what god is going to do in this world for the next several hundred years wow i love that well you know let me get into this first question which coincidentally we know there's no coincidences right but this person it's actually an extension of what you've been saying this says will cat walk through or kind of describe a typical day what does she see in the spirit realm does it look like what does it look like when she prays when she's at the grocery store driving down the road does she see demons attached to people do angels and demons walk through the grocery store just looking at each other so she's kind of wanting it's kind of extension of what you're describing katna you've got the seer anointing gift so do you walk around seeing angels and demons all day long or is that do you just have to almost ignore them or do you pay attention to everything you're seeing i observe um i was the quiet child out of 15 and um my mom will validate that i'm glad that my mom's still alive one day we're going to do a whole show with her it'll be quite interesting and well whatever uh yes i do all the time i see them all the time and i that's how i know how hell operates i mean and people fall under the trap so easily thinking no one will ever know i did these things you're very wrong if you're living a sinful life and you say you're a believer you're very wrong that no one's seeing you the darkness sees you the the the angelic sees you god from heaven can see you and let me tell you he does write things down he's not forgetful he just likes to record things he likes to do that i do the same thing whenever he says something to me i have journals and journals and journals of scenes i have seen words he spoke words that were spoken about things i i have much of that written down but i was the quiet one so i learned early to observe and not say anything i mean a lot of my family didn't know a lot of this was going on at all i was just really quiet didn't have much to say to anybody when you're part of a tribe you don't need to run out and find friends so i didn't really have friends yeah and besides i knew the ones that who weren't doing good things so i just avoided avoiding them wow well that's fascinating so you i mean so you know i remember i'm even going back years not just recently where i'm aware but i'm saying years i would be maybe close to doing something that would be a sin a known sin whatever and i would say to myself i know about three seers and they're gonna see if i do this and if i did this and i thought there's gonna be at least three people that know is that about right are there seers that just simply no god's going to reveal it to two or three well they can see because they know what's around you and it doesn't always have to be demons or angels you can have certain clouds on you you can have different light or less light coming out of you as a seer you would if you know how life operates itself you know what a believer looks like when they just got born again there's so much light coming out of them or sometimes you can see something and it depends on how much god does give measures and all of that he gives measures some people can see certain things at certain times sometimes if he really wants them to see something he will but other times he won't let them see them it's something that you grow into or he just throws it on you well when i arrived when i arrived i could see when i arrived even as a baby i could see things growing up as a little child i could see things and i knew no one else could see them because they never talked about them so i just kept it inside you know how in the bible some people said they just kept it to themselves like mary would consider something and it said that she kept it to herself she didn't necessarily share it um but but i can take you all the way back from when i was really young the things that i saw operating on the earth but the devil has an mo he has mode of operations and um and he cannot know or see everything all at the same time he is not god although he'd like to be that's why he has to have so many of his demons are like scouts and they mark people or if they if he knows someone's heavily anointed the enemy will pursue them to get them caught into crime put in prison so they can't do anything against him a lot of people in prison actually have high calls on their life i've spoken several times in prison and they didn't stay the same when i was there because i told them what was going on with them and i told them how satan had used them and uh anyway yeah i can see everything like even in disney world i'm not talking against disney world itself by the way uh walt disney did make it to heaven people no matter what you thought about him he's there and mickey mouse mickey mouse made it to heaven now he's not in charge of what happens in that whole place right now i know some things he's not happy about that's going on he's just not happy about it but the purpose he designed it and god gave him the ideas so that families and people could go somewhere to have fun they have fun in heaven and he gave him that whole thing but um so i'll i was there one time but the people who come there from all over the world some were just they worship false gods and they can't hide that from me because i see what's with them nobody in the line like i could stand on the line look at everybody and see who they have with them to see the expressions on their angels faces just get out of the way sometimes really so you see both their angels and the demonic that are both there by each person yes oh yes i do and sometimes if the person is not doing something right the demons will mock their angels really i'll walk them because they caught they got them to go into something they shouldn't have um so that's another whole thing that's not i mean hey you have you ever seen yeah and then probably more jen spends a lot of time with me during the daytime and my husband i share a lot with him but my husband is also definitely a quiet person um he has seen several angels he's seen them when they come to me so he knows it's all real but he's scottish and you know you're not moved a whole lot you don't have a whole lot of things like you and god gave me my husband on purpose because he's like this rock okay he's not just moved by things and and he gave me him and i know i have no way out of that because he said i'm giving you somebody and i chose him for you before you were born wow wow but jen knows a lot and jen has learned and learned to discern a lot of things herself because she does spend a lot of time with me like during the day and stuff and she'll start taking authority before we even go and let me tell you i can tell you this demons are in a lot of places uh doing different things they're also recording things or they're speaking into people's ears a lot a lot of the negative things you hear aren't really coming from you is things they're saying and if you hear words that like like i hate that person you should tell the devil just to shut up and go away because you're not going to believe them okay stop them it says take every thought captive and most people don't so they end up a mess you don't need to take any negative thoughts in your head they don't have no right to put it there but they'll they'll do what they can get away with let me ask you a question there's you said you saw the the demons mocking their angels have you ever seen the angels smack one of them down to the oh yeah okay so i'd like to hear more tell us more about that you know i will let the smackdown especially if it's a moment of decision in the purples people's in the people's life if they're having to make a decision a major decision about am i going to go with that group am i going to go do that stuff or am i do i really want to be a part of this thing that i know is wrong and they'll go back and forth and they'll they're they're alone the person is probably alone and they're talking about out loud now i say this enemy can hear what you're saying people so you know say powerful things and say things of light and if you're up for some and say i forgive them that the demons hate the word i forgive they don't want you to forgive people they want you to be offended and stop from hearing god but i can tell this one scene i did see was there were several angels and then this one demon who'd been assigned to pull him off of his track because he's going to be somebody great for god and they kept talking to him so he'd start going in this other direction and i would see the angels go no don't go there no you know you needed not and then they would they would start praying over the person their self like you know i'm declaring they're not going to go there father you can understand uh we're here what what should we say to him this person who's being drawn in the other direction and then all of a sudden the person stand there after the angels had said things now they're not seeing these they're not seeing the angels and demons but they're hearing in their mind what was said and they think that's their self making that that saying that thing and that so the demon is saying hey no one's going to go no one's going to know come on just go this night you know nobody's going to care you know it's not really sin come on you're going to really it's like something never you want to see all that stuff you want to and then the demon would start walking in the direction of this place they were outside this place and then the angel would say oh no you belong to god you know you love god you you were born for a purpose for him then he turned around and go upstairs so you literally could see that he was hearing them i could hear them and uh and then he would be pulled and walking the other directions and then then the angels will go over there and smack the demon and today you might as well get out of here he's not going to go your way you're not going to you're not going to get him you're not getting him and eventually this person did decide to just go the right way and left all of it and the demon was angry he was angry he was screaming and and then one of the angels went over there and just shoved him down and said you need to leave now or it's going to get worse for you and that demon ran off i'm sure he didn't go make a report because if he goes back and reports he wasn't successful he gets punished the angels get rewarded by god they get rewarded by god for encouraging and inspiring uh these people so this person never went into the darkness at all and ended up by being somebody great for god so it happens it does happen that's good you know i'm going to just come up play off this for a minute i know i have so many questions but you're talking about the the literal war between angels and demons and the real person and this is a real encounter and you taught us to just you know take power over all the power of the enemy and then begin to pray and send your hosts out decree these things and you talk about bashing and trashing them and tearing down the strongholds or the highest places or the or the what's the other word you use the platform that they play for yeah so i i've heard there was a ministry uh a woman um you might know the name but i've heard her say one time i think she just told me it was similar because you talked about bashing and trashing um the ending and she was decreeing that these demons that wouldn't leave such and such alone that they'd be put to torture is that sort of the same thing and can you do that can you can you command the host to put those demons to torture if they won't leave you alone something like that is that i would certainly think that you can say anything to especially if it's the army that you command yourself uh they totally and this is what i have found is there's something you give them to tell them to do and they're not allowed like if there's a boundary that they can't go past like they can't kill they can't kill people obviously but uh i actually say do bash mash and trash trash means throw them in a dry place my my home oh that means sew them in a dry place they actually fight them they actually fight them and uh and i tell them to enjoy doing it because uh this makes it different about i know you want to say something what no no no no no i'm just saying good good good this sounds good that means when they're bashed that means they literally will hit them mash them means they're being pushed back and trash them means put them in a dry place so these are orders i give a lot when i send the host to specific places or about different people or those like in the white house i've been sent a whole lot lately and there's a lot of demons operating there because they're given permission not because the person has power but because the people are wicked and when they decree and make rulings that are wicked hell sends more demons around them uh that they can go persecute wherever the stuff is being given or sent out and so i am continually this is one thing i don't do once if this is an ongoing battle and that's what we're in then i don't stop sending them and i can send them like i'll send them a wave of let's say a half a million into dc and they will be there for 10 days 24 hours a day releasing the terror of god on the leaders of these who are helping to compile and come up with these wicked things or come up with come up with ways to punish people or steal from people and that that wave i send will remain there the days i tell them to and every hour they will release or do battle and however i have expressed for them to do it now they have uh their they have they're like platoons or groups or um if i depends on how many i said i could send 10 to a certain place or a half a million or something like that or more their commander that that i give commands to they go with them and make sure they carry all this out when they're done in that 10 days they will fill the sky over my home and they are grinning they are grinning from ear to ear because they did exactly what they were sent for and i will tell you people think it's bad it would be a whole lot worse if there weren't people taking authority and not tolerating the acts of the enemy instead of complaining or being afraid do something about it you say something we get to rule in this world your words are powerful you shall have whatsoever you say you know if you if you believe in your heart you declare it then it shall come to pass when you declare degree thing it shall be established unto you there's all these things and things in the bible uh and when we rule if you're ruling as a king or a priest you have an army with you you have the right to send it where you know things are happening like i've been i sent them to afghanistan i just sent them between russia and the ukraine i sent like a half a billion uh yeah to prevent that stuff from happening to protect and surround the people in ukraine and begin to speak to the leader of russia i mean yeah i say these things to them and they will do those things if it's within the boundaries that god set them and we all know what i'm talking about hopefully the watcher angels were sent and um god put a boundary around them and said you cannot go beyond the bounds i have set for you and you cannot step into another place that you don't have the right to be and of course we know some of those watcher angels broke that that contract god sent them from heaven watcher angels have flesh on them people it's just a tribe of angels god made so people could see them they were to educate man they were never to mix with them they weren't supposed to make you know babies obviously they weren't supposed to mix with with the women on the earth and yet satan got into them and talked to them about oh no you god's uh telling you you can't lead he knows you'll rule he even lies to he lies to his on his own so they stepped when the bounds they were made and left their former estate their former estate is the contract god gave them of what they could do the boundaries were to keep them from going beyond that and yet these watcher angels who were sent to the earth to educate men some of them broke every one of them they lost the relationship with god and they those those watcher angels that created the nephilim those were the offspring of the watcher angels so here's an answer to you how did they create offspring they had flesh on their body so men can see them and learn and learn what was right and help to educate them those watcher angels are bound in chains for future judgment just so you understand that those water angels are not on the earth uh the nephilim who were the offspring uh we could go into another whole thing like that there are not nephilim on the earth right now the not the ones that were nephilim's that were nephilim offspring they died they're called disembodied spirits they still operate with satan so there's more than just demons there's principalities powers i mean as a seer you see all of this and you can identify you know the difference when you're seeing oh that that was a watcher angel or that was a something you know you you kind of can see not every single watcher angel was bad by the way not every one of them decided to be evil i'm sure they had arguments with the ones who did decide because i know they had discussions in heaven back when satan was trying to take over lucifer was trying to take over and he went to tempt all of the angels and got one third to follow him that's mine something isn't that's crazy to think he's a created being and they chose to believe a creed of being than the creator and there was a lot of discussions i was taken back and saw that happening in heaven before lucifer fell okay now you're saying that the what the nephilim which were the giants of the day and they were they turned evil that they died off but then they become disembodied spirits just like someone they they went to the dark side they were evil so now they're just demons who previously had done this nephilim stuff and now they're just demons they're spirits they're spirits they don't have a body they have a spiritual body okay they no longer have their physical body but because they already had given themselves to satan obviously um some of these angels brought in um sacrifice they they talk the dark arts to people that's where the black magic stuff comes but magic's not good people i'm sorry no i'm not sorry it's just not good okay it's not um i don't even like to use the word and i know people look at it as a little fun kind of a thing but not from where it came from so they they had done already wicked things so when they died their flesh died their disembodied spirits are used by satan they they are spiritual beings but they're also high level um evil beings okay well let's see let me ask you a couple more questions here um this april wants to know what is it what can a person do i guess the emphasis would be do what can a person do to become a manifested son or daughter of god that's the question and that's kind of open to anybody it's something that you choose with your life and the choices you make are very important um and they are different from other believers they are believers a manifested son or daughter of god is a believer who has willingly obeyed god that doesn't mean they didn't make mistakes but they came right back on the path he had them on that you're willing and obedient to what god is asking you in your life in other words you can't play in the darkness you can't decide to sin one day and not now you can decide to do that but you will not manifest for god and you cannot say i'm a manifested son or i'm a manifested daughter and yet you have sin in your life and god won't allow it because if that did happen and people had that power and ability within them to manifest the power of the living god and they were sinning then the world would say why should i get saved so in these days we're coming into there is a line being drawn that if you want god to really use you number one don't even consider sinning don't even consider sinning at all uh that's not going to help you in your relationship with god and i'm not saying people won't make mistakes and not make it to heaven and there's a difference in making really serious mistakes and sinning those are two different things serious mistakes could be things that alter your destiny take you off the path um maybe not fulfilling some things that god had asked you to fulfill but you choose in your own flesh to do something else those are these mistakes sin is sin and if it's a sin you need to repent from it and i do not believe this whole thing going around was the blood covered at once and for also sent all you want to no that's not what that means no okay because when you're unrighteous if you sin you're unrighteous you are righteous and there's a big difference what is it if you're if you're become a manifested sins of god is there a moment of time when god says now and he does that and what is a and what is a manifested son or daughter of god because i've never heard a teaching on that so what are they they're obviously sinless because that's clear you just said that but what do they have what's the word higher gifts higher anointings higher power what what how would you describe someone with that versus just a christian who doesn't have that oh when when and i and there are there's also there's right now in this earth manifested sons and daughters people who are beginning to operate in the fullness of that power and it is about power god's trusting you with more power it also is the measure that you have been operating in things will greatly increase okay uh like say you god has given you a gift of influence that influence will be favored without measure it it increases and i do understand all that i don't want people to think they cannot be because they're not smart enough they don't have enough money they're not known it doesn't matter about any of those things it's your heart for jesus it's how much you love him and you desire people to know about him that doesn't mean you have to become a pastor of a church the fifo minister still operating in the earth that doesn't mean you have to be one of those to be a manifested son or daughter if you receive jesus christ in your life and you're a male that makes you that would mean if you if you pursue to manifest for god you tell him that number one if you're a believer you love the word of god and you know you're not running off after sin and you're not bashing people or whatever you do not bash you cannot use this mouth to crush people's hopes steal their dreams away make them feel worthless you are not ever going to manifest for him because the things you speak is how you operate in measures of that power is what you say it says it will speak to the lay and the sea in the air and they will obey it clearly says that you'll say to a mountain it'll jump into the sea and jump back out that would be a manifested son of god speaking to that for whatever purpose that was those those things are going to happen that's another reason why the rapture isn't going to happen right now god's training these generations right now on the earth to manifest and demonstrate who he is and what he stands for and you begin to live in a way that you desire to please him more than anything else and you actually say to god i want to be just like you that's not saying you want to be him right this is hard if you will say i want to be just like you i want to love like you i want to help people like you you don't want people to hear your voice when i speak i said all those things to him he'll begin to answer back because he knows now that's remember when he said david was a man after his heart remember that oh yeah that's hard now he did make mistakes but he always got back in line where god had him he would worship him and speak to him like he really was real and i say people can have conversations in all kinds of ways but having a conversation with god is really how all of this begins to start he wants he can see it's in your heart but he wants you to say what's in your heart and and and but the manifested sons and daughters the earth is in travail right now not because it's the end time is crying out for the manifested sons and daughters to stand up and begin to operate in the earth they are very important to god and you might not nobody know you at all that doesn't mean you want to manifest and demonstrate signs and wonders in the earth even some never seen before those days haven't happened yet no but we're right there on the edge of that beginning and so you're saying that a person should be saying and i guess what you're saying use your mouth to say to the lord i want to become a manifested son or daughter of god are you saying it's not just you're laying there and you're you're having a quiet time with the lord and you're saying in your heart i want to become a a manifested son are you saying it actually needs to be said or do you just mean whether you use your mouth or your heart you continue to i think you should say it to him i can only go by my own experience and um that i literally would begin to say things alone i mean god people he make appointments for everything else tell god jesus i want to meet you tonight at 10 10 p.m i'll be wherever trust me he'll be there and if you can't see him and then you talk like he is there that's good i haven't done everything i was supposed to but i'm making a decision in my life i'm running after you with everything i have because the word says if i seek for you with all of my heart i will find you i want to find you i want to know you i want to operate for you i want to demonstrate that you are alive and in who you are in this earth you will delight the heart of god but he will also make notice that you have now made a declaration that he can then take and begin to work with you uh and especially make sure you've got holy spirit if you haven't i would encourage you to to um ask for the impartation of speaking in tongues and the holy spirit moving inside when you get born again holy spirit is out here walking with you but when you say holy spirit i choose to invite you to indwell me he literally goes from here to in here and then that will help you share clearly um and i even talked to the holy spirit also thank you holy spirit for guiding me if there's anything i'm not aware of make me aware of that is there something i haven't done yet please let me know that and you begin to hear um it may be on the inside but you begin to hear him also speak to you you have to understand this is god's heart for you to represent him in this earth is enough representing the evil but there is no demon bigger than the the ma the massive angels i have seen and it's their words and the fear they try to use to manipulate you let me tell you what there's one angel that could take a hold of a demon or a principality and and shred them and throw them like paper across the sky so don't you ever think that satan has the biggest ones even if that matters thou greatest power in this earth is the love of god and the life of god and the blood that was shed for you gives you the right to rule and reign in dominion and authority over darkness yeah well kat now i want to ask you this is either malachi at three or four and there's a saying you know they some people began to complain and they said what do we get for serving now we are we have just the same problems as everyone else very paraphrased you know why are we different than anyone else but it says those that feared the lord talked about him that was the version that i read those that fear the lord talked about him and god said they will be mine in the day when i make up my treasured possession do you know what that day is because you said earlier in this broadcast that you need to talk about him that god would take note that i thought of that scripture um what does it mean they will be mine the day i make it my treasured possession if if you know that i i will say this first my first comment i will make is the fear of the lord is not you being afraid of jesus christ the fear of the lord is you being afraid that you will do something to hurt him okay that's the correct answer for the fear of the lord that you love him so much you don't want to do something that would hurt him so that's when he said when you speak of the fear of the lord they're talking about the love they have for the lord and who he is that's what they these people will talk about i i do that all the time yeah um i'm supposed to bring hope and um but i'm not afraid there's nothing in me that's afraid father son of a husband but i don't ever want anything you know that would hurt them or make them uh disappointed yeah and i guess i had assumed it was meant it meant the reverential aw or something like that right those who feared the lord in other words they honored and respected something like that okay yeah there is going to be a time uh there's days coming on the earth one when there will be a seal i'm not talking about the the the thousands that would be sealed in the end times i'm not talking about that uh pray that my people be willing in the day of my power that is tied to that jesus said pray my people be willing in the day of my power and that is the power of the living god being seen on this earth in in mass in many places the signs and wonders and things like that doing those who are out there already speaking about who he is and what he means to them yeah god is going to go and choose those teeth those people to begin to demonstrate like stop an earthquake and make it put it back the way it was before it came that would be a demonstration wow he's going to choose those who are already his and he has marked them for his own uh that's like treasure to him we are treasured to god on this earth and when you allow yourself to be used uh like a treasure chest that god can pull that goodness out of you his goodness out of you the trust you have the belief the faith the faith the faith to stand up and be not be uh slow in declaring what god wants to do or just step out and and be a part of what he's doing that's what that's talking about but jesus saying pray that my people those are those who follow him right they're not fans of jesus they're followers that's a whole different thing you're not a fan okay these people jesus say pray that my people be willing in the day of my power that's his power being demonstrated in us that would be a manifested son or daughter of god and in that day the way he he makes them known as his treasure is them actually doing these things awesome awesome awesome awesome all right um this person wants to know when we were little spirits inside the father before we came to the earth were we already male and female and or was that decided when we were sent to our mother's womb i don't know if you would even know the answer but i do know the answer okay awesome he he already knew what you would be he already knew that and he wrote it on your soul actually he has written things on your soul and he's already written on your soul male or female and i know they say it's up to the gender of whatever or whoever does whatever no it's up to god if his purpose he chose you for and he chose you as a female while you were still in him he even sometimes will choose who you will be married to that would be a male he made us male and female okay not two males and not two females people um that's totally against what god's whole purpose is to to bring a life to be able to bring those spirits down male and a female the other kind can't do anything and that's just the enemy's way of i just get this you're getting this for free the reason why that's so prevalent right now is anytime god's going to do something great on the earth the devil wants to keep the little spirits leaving god to come down to years to become who god appointed us to be so two males cannot make a baby people and two females cannot make a baby that is the number one reason why satan promotes that and it's so prevalent is he's terrified of who's going to be born in this time and that's one way besides abortion to stop that from happening just so you know that yes on on on the inside of your will that's in the core of your being he writes on there what you will be so he already knows if you're going to be a male or female it says he's written every day of your life in the book before you even came to the earth yes he knew if you'd be male or female and satan likes to twist that twist those things so that you won't accomplish what he wants you to so he does know by the way he knew i would be a female he knew the family that i would be born into he knew the purposes he had for me and i learned early what those purposes were uh even when i was young i knew that god has something special for me even when i didn't know what it was so i was excited uh being one of the silent ones doesn't mean you're not a deep thinker doesn't mean god can't be speaking to you i have grandchildren that already hear him and grandchildren who are already being caught up to show them things in heaven oh wow so this this is going to happen people and it's going to be god's way you get to choose this day he says i offer you life or death choose life so if you ever wondered what does he think about people dying and being murdered and killed well that shows you right there he is totally against death and dying all right but even when you do die if you belong to him it's not a bad thing and i know that seems hard to you but i've been in heaven many times and people arrived i've been on years when many people left to go to heaven i have seen hell i don't talk a lot about that i'm just saying that you don't want to go there don't ever stop praying for your family members to know jesus christ and to be with you in eternity but yes god knows who you will be and he doesn't like it when saint begins to pervert things but he really doesn't like it when he begins to take the lives of those who he sent and appointed to be on the earth and then make their life end and i think to god that's one of the worst things anybody could see could do would be to take the life of the babies uh and you know what happened what he says about that yeah oh yeah now cat you said a minute ago that sometimes he picks even picture uh the person you're gonna marry i is very clear to me that god picked doreen we're married 44 years when we were each six years old which is one year apart in our age the enemy tried to kill us in our she was on the east coast an accident her parents were killing me i was on the west coast the year before and in a flip over bus accident and both of us came out completely unscathed and then later we found each other that's very clear to me but i didn't hear the lord i i just followed you and it became clear that this is who god had directed me you heard the lord but there are there people who god doesn't do that and just allows them to make their choice of who they want to marry what do you see in that i think it depends entirely on what he has chosen you to do on the earth i think that has a lot to do with it uh there are certain people that he has to have here for appointed times and in order for them to be able to operate in fullness then he picks the right person that he chose for you in order for you to do that there's a lot of men who would not have put up with me being gone so much and uh he actually had my husband take me back to the altar and say i'm giving you back to her for these 10 years so that you can push her up he really did now that doesn't mean we weren't married that means my husband never complained about me being gone sometimes i would be home a day and a half and pack and leave there were several years that i lived my life like that when god was pushing me out there to be known on purpose it wasn't what i would have picked at all i was the person who didn't care if anybody talked to me or touched me i like being alone a lot i have found though that most prophets don't mind being alone because that gives you more time to be with god and now for 10 years have expired now my husband goes with me a lot it doesn't mean god was going to stop that that he was he was there's a lot of people who men who wouldn't have done that they just would say no you're not doing that and so in order for that doesn't mean it was maybe the perfect person because my husband are very opposite we still love each other and this would be 45 years this year we'll be married and i still think he is the greatest thing awesome well you know i was talking to a young woman she actually was on this program i think we put her on the air once but we were talking about you and she said i if i understood her correctly because you know um but she said it it must have been hard because i talked about how your husband's a fisherman he loves fish you don't even like the smell of fish you know and so and she said that must have been hard that must be hard for her and i said i don't think it's hard i think they like telling people their opposites in those areas i don't think it's hard for her but what would you say is that was that made it hard for you that he loves fishing no i just it's very funny the sense of humor that god has because that's what i was thinking i'm gonna give you ways to sharpen you you know i mean it's like jesus never was married so he didn't didn't have the husband and wife relationship no he was married to church people uh so he didn't have to do that but there's even the angels is a good example like they they're not married they don't get married but god sends ones on assignment that are total opposite personalities so they have to sharpen each other learn to get along and i think that god this is what god said he said to me i couldn't make it too easy for you had to sharpen you too easy for you and he said then he'll say i didn't make it easy for my son and that was the time he took me back and showed me all the disciples going down this road to go speak and what they actually in the beginning what he actually gave them what he gave him to train and learn in those two short years that was not easy for jesus yeah the statements he made so sometimes he'll he'll he may not means this perfect in every way like he says every word perfect or treats me perfect in every way but the one thing for sure is uh i very much love my husband and have fallen in love with him more than once so that's your husband's name is bing we call him captain bean because he is a cat he was a boat captain and he wears that i think he wears that captain hat sometimes but when he came to israel with you guys you guys were obviously best friends i was going to ask you this because you brought up that the lord had taken you back in time you were literally at the tim i if i'm remembering right when you and i showed up at the tomb together was that your first time at that tim in person yes but and you're saying that was the same tune the garden team as we know it and because you were there you'd seen it yes yes it had that same you know it had the same the way it looked on the outside except there was one piece a little bit different and i found i didn't know there had been an earthquake at the team and a piece of the doorway i think it was or the entrance had fallen out and they had kind of repaired it and i knew something had been done to it because when i was taken back there it was different i didn't know that the earthquake had happened they had repaired that but they even had like the stonework where um it's like the stone has to ride in a um like a train rider and then that stone was in there that would roll over to the the mouth of the tomb and then be rolled away and um but there was there were flowers back when i saw it there were flowers planted in that place except of course where the stone came and well there was flowers right there and that's where i saw jesus standing i saw the various place where he stood and had his back turned to me when i was there and of course the two angels were still uh there yeah i was phenomenal and you know when we had uh there was a jewish messianic jewish uh believer about 22 years ago when he went to first went to israel and he was very much down on against that this garden team was the right place it was more likely because of his studies he said it was in this place because they take you to two places at least they did 22 years ago and then this one was inside and there but but i find it phenomenal because the guy that did the presentation showed us the the place of the skull and that had been damaged by an earthquake because when i saw it 22 years earlier you could see the skull and then some of it was broken away but it's interesting because you felt the anointing you had been there that solves the you know it doesn't matter what an expert in israel says it only matters that you you felt the anointing and uh you said we went into the team together and you said and you felt it you know i didn't really strong yeah yeah that's amazing to me could you visualize uh back in the day where he would have laid exactly do you remember when we went inside could you see he is he was right here yeah because he was still life there there was still light on the very place he laid oh wow the glory and the anointing will remain in places it's like i think i also told you that i actually got to go in where they have king david's tomb that actually has his body in it and um they they have a curtain dividing that the women can go on one side and the men on the other but oh my goodness i could feel the anointing the anointing stays in the bones that's when they threw that person over the you know the uh into the pit of wherever that was and his body hit elisha's bones remember that yeah because the anointing stays with the body part the anointing stays with the body and so i felt such anointing coming from king david's tomb uh so it was it was such a delight to be there that i got to see all these things like where where the holy spirit came zoom in the upper room and there's still a fiery portal there where he came in uh where that happened but the two angels at the tomb i was not expecting that and i did know there were two angels there the bible talks about the two angels part of their reward was they got to stay and that they call it a holy place even heaven calls it a holy place it's where he was that he died where he was buried where he rose from the dead came up from hell and got his body back is a very powerfully anointed place um and his anointing was still inside the tomb where his body laid for those three days that's amazing that's just amazing to me um and then i came out we came out of the tomb and i looked up to the left uh julie smith who is our producer in here hadn't gone in at the same time but she i think she'd either just gone in but she was standing up on the stairs watching us come out and she says i have never felt an anointing like i feel here and she operates in a strong sea or anointing you know so you both had said the same thing within about a minute and a half of each other so i thought wow this is the place you know so i encourage anyone to go by the way people have asked us we we had stopped the israel tour because they were they were requiring more vaccinations and mass than anybody on the earth so when that clears up probably next year we'll do an israel tour by the way that's about our time today are you you your um cruises are full are you doing one or two and they're full i can't remember what the deal is on the cruises well they actually have um they the royal caribbean stopped those cruises they were full at one point but the one to greece and then there was one i think to the eastern caribbean right jen yeah like saint thomas and saint martins we had that they were pretty much booked um but they stopped it because they were going to require vaccinations and uh and nobody wanted that so it's i guess it's on hold it's like i think they gave the people who had paid you can either go ahead and get your refund or keep it here and when it reopens they fully intend to do those those cruises i think they were even considering one for alaska for me like in the summer time to do a cruise to alaska yeah which i didn't know that i ever want to take but here's pretty it's beautiful there and there's not like as much ice and snow in there but but the greece one is definitely still on hold or still want to go to greece and um and so i do know that i think in in the coming future i'll probably will do three a year with them oh wow yeah they're fun i've been on dream i've been on a lot of cruises but my favorite one was whatever that's been seven eight years ago i've lost a little track of time when we went on we didn't we weren't doing it with you we attended it while you were speaking because i wanted to check you out you know and i had said does anybody know is kat the real deal and julie had said you were and victoria boyson had said you were and so i said i'm going on this victoria but you end up in our room we were there for like four hours or something like that they couldn't find it i don't remember exactly or two hours whatever it was it was a long and that the the moment that was my favorite i don't know why just this one answer and i said cat this says seven eight nine years i said are you telling me as you're sitting here that you've sat and had a conversation with the god of the entire universe father god just like that and you go yes and i'm going and i believed it i actually believed it when he said i i went because in me you might as well blasted me with the spirit even though i didn't feel anything i thought that is cool because i totally believed it i saw it on your face yeah and i can say this for sure god definitely picked doreen for you because she never complained once the whole time we were in there these are very important he was listening and enjoying it but but you were like like you were just that wasn't the only time we talked at the dining table we were offered the dining room to get together and i think um steve swanson was there he was doing worship i believe and uh so they sent us around this one big table with uh um uh pastor mike in them and the whole time we were doing nothing but talking back and forth right while they were eating uh because that was being hold on a whole lot but i didn't mind because there's so much revelation to share i'm always when somebody is hungry god said if they're there you'll share so i have a mandate so there you'll share my husband will just go eat away and enjoy it that he's not the one having to talk yeah i mean i was a sponge on that trip i went wanting to learn about him and i bought a bunch of books that i brought with me on the cruise but that but yours was the one you know that really yeah brought here soon well anyway cat that was really really really good today sorry we didn't get a number of questions answered but we will folks we got the list but we're getting really really really good revelation today so tell people what they can get there revealinghaven.com and anything else we see on the screen we've got revealingheaven.com revealingheaven.com is one of my websites and that's where we post our events our upcoming events and we also have our store there because when god said that i would do this he said that you will have products that you can sell to make money to help support what you're doing and he said but those products aren't going to be normal they're all going to be wrapped around heaven truth on heaven or different things that the holy spirit wants to say and i always show this cup because it's a good example this is one of the things that the holy spirit gave me this to say and put on a cup and it says i don't do demons and it starts a big conference you see the lightning bolt right there in the middle and i said that's satan being taken out of heaven people every time you see that and uh so so he he gives me all kinds of things to say and do we're gonna have a whole line of apparel we'll be putting out and um home decor we're going to be putting out with sayings of heaven or scenes from heaven that we'll be putting out in this year god wants to flood the earth with revelation and that revelation can be by word it could be by images it could by by things that represent and the holy spirit said why can't we have things rather than heaven the devil's been doing it the devil's got his mark and his image on a lot of things and god says about time we put heaven and and and the host image on things so so that's what that website's for i have catker.com which is where there's it's a spiritual platform for the father to say whatever he wants to that's exactly what that is and he does say whatever he wants to and uh so there's different interviews i've had with different people you know patricia king is one of them she was real precious uh enjoyed talking with her so much and then there's also all kinds of videos that you can watch that will train you in different things in the spirit and things that the father has for all of us on the earth and it is the only way that you can give to me online if that is your decision to do it go to catcure.com click on the treasury or you can become a member of the guardian zone those are our monthly supporters and i know that for you steve also that you help us you mean so much to us that you are actually giving to heaven's plan whether it's me doing something or steve and i want to remind everybody out there steve is important to god whether he'll ever say it or not he has opened a door and put a platform out there for god's prophets to speak his words and i have to add what the holy spirit showed me he said it's even more than elijah list where you would send out all the emails and i know probably probably millions of them been sent out the way you would get the word way back then was you would join the join the list and they would email you words of what god said prophets but now that elijah's stream is here god said it's another whole level because you're not just reading the word you know man should not live by bread alone that's the written word whether it's words from god or the word but by every word spoken from the mouth of god and aligned to streams this is what the father said the father holy spirit elijah's streams allows him to speak to the mouth of man of his prophets so that men shall not live without every word being spoken from the mouth of god he said that's what elijah's dreams does that's why it's so powerful so so terrifies the devil that you have allowed to do that and it's also going to not stop growing so all those who give to elijah's dreams and help that make happen you're actually helping the father to have a way to speak his honorable word to people in the earth wow well thank you kent that's very kind of you to say that and i received that word wow that's powerful i'll tell people who we're going to have tomorrow's a new guest um andrea holbart is a friend that i dream and i met 18 years ago at a kim clement conference who stayed in touch on and off she's a flight attendant by occupation even then 18 years ago and still is i'm not we won't mention the airline because she wants to keep that part but she's she's a prophetic voice there but she has grown in this airline to be one of those that they bring in to train to look for traffic children being trafficked on the airlines and she'll talk about that what god has shown her and then god's given her some revelation on 45. i'll just say it that way that she wants to share and i've learned to trust her prophetic voice so you're going to really enjoy it she's a dear friend of drean and i and that'll be good so that's tomorrow's program so kat thank you again and again i do hope everyone will support your mystery remember that's catcare.com if you do want to

hey welcome to elijah's dreams it's uh happy wednesday march 2 2022. glad to have you here sorry we're a little bit late today we're going to get going right away in just a few minutes we're bringing on cat curves uh as you all remember is one of our favorites your favorite so this could be great uh i just wanted to uh make only one kind of announcement there's a lot of times we give words of knowledge and after the the show we get pummeled in a good way with people writing in and saying that was me that was me that was me you would be surprised almost any potent word about five people they will write in at least five and say that was an exact fit for them and in every case it really is because they'll tell us their situation i had a word the other day about casting out nines and it was a very strange word i'd never given such a word but i said why did this pop in my head yesterday where i was thinking about this new math of mathematics not new it's an old rec for those that are into math might have heard that uh technique about casting out nines when you're uh i think long addition and there's you do these things and you add this if you see a nine you you cast it out i don't know how to do it really i just if you google it or you'll find out what casting out nines was so all of a sudden god gave me that word about casting out nines and i said it may have to do with uh um some of you are feeling and i'm just gonna paraphrase it that some of you are feeling like a castaway or cast off or you felt cast off and it has something to do with nine and i said maybe february 29 someone answered confirmed that i said you might be one of what nine children i believe that's the way i said it that was on andrea hobart's program and i had a bunch of people that said i'm one of nine children and i've always felt like a castaway or cast off so i had a situation um and i gave this word i'm gonna just tell you two quick ones one lady wrote in and said she was one of nine and it always felt like she was a cast off cast cast out of her family outcast i think is the one i was trying to play and um so then she talked about how she was one of those that just loved it i don't know if she used the word adrenaline but scary things she loves scary things that frighten you like bungee jumping or whatever it is that she's she would have said and i said it's interesting that you would say that and you feel like an outcast because i said five years ago the only other time i've ever given this word in fact it was the only time i ever gave this word uh i was in a conference and i called out i was actually enjoying the conference along with everybody else i wasn't speaking and there was a young woman there dressed um whatever you could say conservatively uh and i came over to her and i said i have a word for you can i is it okay and then she immediately started motioning me to come back into the lobby because it turns out she didn't speak english at all she's cuban so she brought back an interpreter with her and i i said boy lord i hope i get this right because he didn't look anything like the word but the word was the lord loves the way you like to be scared you like to do adrenaline i see you in a jeep doing scary things bungee jumping i began with and she immediately broke down sobbing because it was an exact match to her um and so that lady the other day and this lady from cuba really illustrates the point that god made you the way you are and many of you are feeling like outcast but the reality is god specifically made you the way you are to enjoy the things whether it's art or music or or any kind of thing that makes you strange to the rest of the group god probably was in that when he made you that way um and if there were things that didn't get redeemed he'll redeem that so anyway i wanted to share that the other thing i want to share real quick was andre who who was the guest for the day god began to tell her after the show to look for the code look for his code in the show itself even even the things that we were saying god had another message and so she began to research it and realized that when i was talking about castaways or outcasts having to do with the number nine as we spoke they were debating in congress whether they could go ahead and pass this law that would allow abortion right up to the ninth month just before delivery that you were able to kill the baby inside the arm you were able to cast it off and you might remember if you watched that this anointing came on me and i i even had tears and it was intense and god's anger burned against the enemies we cast out and said i have not cast you off so i hope you'll watch that but uh there's just so you know when we have all these words of knowledge virtually everyone gets answered maybe there's one once in a while that nobody responds to but it's extremely common for every word we give to have someone respond to it so i thought i would tell you that because we can't replay them all all the time so all right let's bring kat in here and we'll get going here cat cat cat there he is there she is hey good good to see you kat it's good to see you too how are you doing today well um i am awake [Laughter] this is your kind of morning hours right this is for you this is morning well the other day i had an hour and a half sleep and so i went like probably 20 hours um just getting stuff done and doing things that i had to and so yeah i finally i think i finally laid down on 8 30 a.m this morning was when but i'm wide awake now i'm excited to feel with god and excited about the days we're living in and i'm wearing these colors they represent royalty um i i love the color purple mainly because of that um there's a lot of that in the throne room of god a lot of purple uh this cobalt blue color uh deep colors beautiful things but anyway i'm really excited about what god has been speaking about right now in this world now not waiting for things to clear up or or go away or people wanting to run and hide and yet the power of god is about to be uh just displayed everywhere in this earth the earth is the lord and the fullness thereof it belongs to him not to hell not to the left not to anyone and what he says is what's going to happen so i just want to once again um let everyone know that i know it doesn't look good to you but god does know what's going on and yes he does expect us to say something against the darkness and stand up and be somebody for him and so instead of the opposite going through your mind or your heart you need to be filled with him it's real simple i'm just gonna just declare right now show you right now at the beginning of the show that if you're being bothered with issues of uh like you're abandoned like you're rejected like you're not wanted that is a spirit trying to control you you need to just cast out that spirit of fear from you lose that from your soul lose all fears cares concerns you know a rejection a dishonor that people unjust criticism and judgment against you just get it out of you and then you just say these words father i choose my will to bind to my soul which is who you are god's life his love his presence his validation his expectation his will his way his joy his celebration right now in jesus name and what you've just done was remove everything the enemy's been trying to put in you instead you were now having on the inside of you what god wants you to say what he is planned for you and who you really are and it is so important in these days to make sure you don't let your soul grieve or be sad then he will use sadness against you even as a weapon don't keep it in you you do not have to because then you will prosper and be in health even if it prospers and so i know the father has me i tell perfect strangers this on sidewalks inside their cafes or anywhere if i see that they have a great cloud around them i'll go over and say do you need help and i'll say you need to do god he's made a way for you to get rid of that i don't care who they are even what they what who what their religious belief system they have i just introduced god in that way and right there i'll have them lose all that stuff from their soul jesus comes down and pulls it out and then they are then now being consumed with every word they speak because the light begins to go in their soul and the layers of your soul what's in there is what you will be what you display the emotions you will have and instantly within minutes these very people who had a cloud of you know uh fear or rejection or just abandonment whatever it was around them is gone it is totally gone and the light of god comes on them and you're changed in seconds and so i want to encourage people if you need that in your life no matter what anyone is saying about you what things look like you begin to say those words every single day and you'll be so filled with god there'll be no room for the enemies words or controlling manipulating stealing killing people's words they'll be out of you and then you're ready to do things for god because in these days we are ruling with jesus christ good good good well you know hey i want to ask you a question even before we get into these questions that i have in front of me um as a follow-up to what we did with manuel yesterday manuel johnson you know him his gifting she's very different than you in almost every way except you and man will share one unique from my observation is he god will show him he'll either take him to the future or he'll show him a vision for him he'll show him what is what will be he'll take him to the present in the future time he'll take him to the future and it's the prayer he does that for you so my question was so god told you how this was going to turn out who would be the president who was going to be shamed and taken you know whatever whether they're arrested or they're just shamed away yeah does he then in all of the ensuing months not hardly give you any details at all because he's told you what the end is and therefore so people will come and say well how can this be how is this possible and you're saying what i saw is that what it is you just you don't have the details god rarely gives you the details or what how does that work for you he does give me details many times and when he takes me somewhere i am actually there yeah actually in the future what he shows me in the future i am in that future time it's not a vision of that time it's not thoughts about that time he literally takes me into that time and what i see is reality it's it's not it's not just a mystery it's really truly what life will be in those times he shows me that and when you've seen it yourself and you've been there no one can take that away from you but you should just as fierce about the very promises god gave you and you know he gave them to you it doesn't regardless of what's going on now that you're seeing in the earth and man's realm uh god's purposes and plans supersede all of that and since god has been from the beginning to the end and the end to the beginning he does know what's going to happen and yes he does sometimes just let the time take its course if he's training people and things or he's about to introduce something time is everything on when when god is releasing something in a new time he's not going to wait for things to clear up okay he will make sure the enemy gets crushed and pushed back but your words are very powerful in these days and that's something he never stopped saying and by the way steve he talks to me almost every single day this is never a one-time thing when he shows me something uh he'll show me sometimes many times uh the same kind of place any place let me see it all over again question my soul i see details every time he takes me when i say i've seen that celebration of many times now that literally will happen and people go how will that happen how is that possible that's kind of that's got faith people you have to believe god who is sovereign you believe him for who he is who made everything by those things that you do not see he made everything do you think he cannot say something or do something in days that he has things plain on his own timeline those things might not maybe happen they will happen to me it matters not how they happen i know they will happen and i know what life will be and we're entering into the greatest days we've ever seen on this earth and in order for those great days to happen he has to expose in full detail the evil the wickedness who's involved in it and let me tell you what the father said after this whole thing when it's like dust to us and these days we're going through they will be like dust some people involved in them they will be dust that's how he says it to me some will not survive this i'm talking about the evil and the wicked not that he doesn't love them but they've made their choices and and this is a sea time in harvest time so all we've been seeding with our lives with our mouths uh with our choices over these last three years we're about to get a major harvest no demon no man no government official nobody can stop that from happening so greatness and glory and acceleration is coming to the one side but justice and demise and a judgment being done and also not just judgment but some people are going to be incarcerated some will lose everything they have because they've been cheating and stealing everywhere in this world they will lose everything they have because that was the choice they made to kill steal and destroy and when you do that in the sea time and harvest time you've already seated for your downfall i'm talking about the wicked justice has to come it's going to come but for the other side who continue to go forward to love to help to inspire and encourage greatness of acceleration is coming to shove you even further out in front so people will know who to believe who to trust so god does have uh his way of doing things which is already taking place that nobody can stop and when he makes a declaration himself from his throne it's going to happen and count when there when uh there's a scripture that says believe in his pro not believe it believe his prophets and you will prosper itself it's an odd promise it's like you can prosper or not prosper here's the here's the key in the in that scripture believe what his prophets say just believe it and because a minute ago you said if i if i quoted you roughly correctly you said you don't really care how it's going to happen or something like that you said but just god showed you that's going to happen in your case you're believing god in our case we're believing you who's believing god and of course by believing you we're believing god so is that so people that that are in this situation are going man it's been a month it's been a year and some months and and i can't see how it's going to happen is there a is god looking at this thing and saying look i said when the son of man comes will he find faith on the earth you i told you to cat a prophet you've watched her be consistent so is he expecting his people to not stress out over the how it's going to happen because that's a lack of faith he is absolutely expecting them not to be stressed or not to be fearful if they really are believing him uh and i say if you can't even believe him and trust him at least trust him you know he made everything the word says he does he's proven that over and over again he himself talking about the father he knows what he wants done and he knows when it will happen he's trying to keep you on the path so you don't lose a great reward you don't lose acceleration and so i tell people uh believing him there's belief trust and then you step into faith faith is an actual thing there come a day when you keep believing and trusting him but you say it i don't care if it's in your own home i choose to be what god said i choose to believe what he has for this time not what man is saying not what the devil is playing i'm choosing the living god and he will start to put something in you to make you stronger in one day a prophet an unknown prophet called me one day he said this day god has said you have stepped from trust and belief you've stepped into faith and he'll never take that measure of faith away from you and that measure of faith now gives you favor without so when measurement are doing this it's not really you so much trying to make it happen although helping god if you want to call it that is what you're declaring from your own mouth you shall have whatever you say if you declare a thing a decree thing you do not down your head that's going to be established unto you so you want to you want fear established in you you want destruction established unto you or do you want the very words god said do you want what he's saying that even in these days it will be powerful it'll be great the glory is coming the fire of god is coming you need to talk about those things that he has planned because these people who are out there doing this stuff they will be nobody and they will be nothing one day but where will you be standing with god when the sting hole clears are you gonna be on his path filled with faith because of what you have chosen to believe yourself even if no one else in your family is believing it you need to believe what god says if you believe he's holding you in his hand he knows his plans for you he's not going to let you fall you need to begin to say that yourself out loud and i've learned this this is really a truth in the spirit realm what you begin to say and believe causes faith to rise in you the possibility of doing these supernatural things to rise in you but you won't do it if you're not saying it i remember when i began i could begin to say you know to god i want to be just like him and he was delighted when i said that that i choose to believe him against all else and i know that my faith is with him i know he has plans for me and i said yes one day i know that i will walk on water i will walk on air i will not fall i know that i'll succeed in everything you've said or everything you've promised i will travel in the spirit i will raise the dead in mass i will will speak to the volcanoes i will speak to the earthquakes all these things he'd show me what happened i began to say they would happen even if it wasn't me i said they would happen and right immediately when i began to say that those things begin to happen okay i walked on in here i've been into the supernatural i had the veins of the rainbow coming from me uh people seeing fire in my eyes because these things that he said are coming you have to declare them yourself and you begin to build a habitation of heaven in your life instead of the lies and the stuff that the fake news is putting out or people feel what fear are putting out you don't live with those people they don't say who you are god says who you are you're his son his daughter and you need to stay on that path that he put you on and not begin to change your mind oh god change his mind i try you he has not changed his mind he will perform every word spoken by his true prophets is what he will do because he told them he would do it and let me tell you cannot tell a prophet of god that they need to start saying something else because they're listening to him alone speaking for him because of what he said and what he showed them you're not getting them off the path you put them on because they don't want to miss their destiny with god and you don't have to miss yours either that's good that's good well you know it reminds me what when this the election happened in uh 2020 uh our 20 is it 19 is it and then 20 it was a 2020 election but it happened in i don't know i forget what it's 2020 probably it was 2020 november the third was when the 2020 election happened in november it was looking good and then it started looking i said what's going on hey they're closing this area they're closing the state early because they're supposedly i thought what's going on and my heart began to sink and sink and then drain walked into the door she had been gone for a while and and i did she said how's it going i go you know not not such faith king i just said i don't understand what i'm seeing and then she began to be a little bit discouraging and all of a sudden kat as if god went in front of me this my spirit just went up and i said god is not going to turn his back on all the people who prayed these prayers they're gonna do that because blah blah blah you know because people are making up stories about this was trump's fault they were already making excuses for a loss and i just this thing came over me i said it with my mouth and that changed the whole atmosphere in the house in the room and so it's you know it's kind of what you're describing that's what i went to when you just described that using your mouth and if you remember we were gonna only broadcast through november the third and then we weren't gonna have any more and god had said when you tell steve i want november the 4th i need to say something in november the 4th before any of that happened he said that so guess what when they shut it down immediately right next to me he said to me this is when they're going to cheat and steal the election they'll bury the ballots burn the ballots fake ballots i mean he went down this whole list of exactly what they were doing while he was saying to me he was telling me what was going to happen and then on november the 4th god said it that's what we said on that show this is what god said last night they stole the election uh they're stealing it they're putting millions of extra votes in um they have made fake ballots they had them waiting to put in there to count them and that's why they closed early it wasn't because they were overwhelmed by how tired they were because that was their plan to steal it so trump won and i got to say it he won just like god said he would win the 2020 election he won they stole it when you steal you don't win that's right yeah they didn't win they still don't have power to be where they're at they're operating with no power or authority given to them by man or by god okay we voted 100 million people voted for righteousness justice liberty and freedom and they didn't have anything like what they said they did and they made it however many they needed they put more than enough of the cheating line and stealing to look like that the election flipped in the favor of the other person db person that's all he'll let me call him and i can tell you right now god will have his way justice is going to come and they will have to say with their own mouths the media will have to say these words we were wrong that election was stolen trump is our president he deserves this four years they're going to say it people i don't care what you think anyone in the earth thinks or the lying cheating stealing people you can't stop it from happening because this is the time for justice to be served it will be served he won and that's all i can that's all i'm saying about that one he is the president people the other person is a fake and a fraud and whether anybody likes it or not that is the truth get your head out of the stand get it out of your soul stop listening to the lying fake news they're probably gonna lose their network i can tell you right now new ones even as i'm speaking are rising up that would be so powerful in years they will tell the truth yes you will know it is the truth and this is what god has got planned days of glory of truth of of justice is coming and no one can stop that from happening because you're not god and he is and he will have his way and that's what he was saying to me no i never was in fear i knew immediately what they had done because he told me on november the 3rd in the evening as he's saying well we're going to shut down now you know we'll pick it up in the morning and i'm like nah that cannot be happening and the father said no this is when they're gonna cheat and steal it so guess what he knew before they even started doing it he knew what they were doing so you can hide nothing from the eyes of god and if you think he's doing nothing you don't know him yeah and you know kat let me just make this statement you agree or disagree but i i watched i could only handle the first first third of the state of the union i couldn't handle it past that but i would say for anyone that's doubting if you go back and watch it or maybe you did watch it and ask yourself this question is the blessing of god is the favor of god on that b person you call him the b person i'll call him 46. is the blessing of god on him or not on him it's not on him it's not on him there's no favor there's no blessing there's no mercy there's no grace yeah it stumbles down when when people are wicked and evil they cannot create anything good if you wonder what's wrong with that whole group they're wicked the wicked cannot create good there's never going to be a good thing come out of any of this that's going to be seen in the earth they'll be known as some of the worst people on the face of the earth because of what they try to do you you're colluding with hell actually that's who you're colluding with help can't create anything good there's nothing good in them there's no life in them they're only death killing stealing destroying that's what's in hell right now that's what that's how the satan operates he comes to kill steal destroyed you can see that that is what's going on your right because those people are agreeing with that but they're not god and he's about to show you they're not god and yes he's got people selected for certain positions and new creations coming that he's not willing to let the enemy have them so if you think it's all over on this earth you don't know you don't know what you're thinking okay you're hearing words spoken to you and thoughts spoken to you it says take every thought captive that rises up against god himself so if you have thoughts negative to what's being said right now that is not god that is the enemy trying to trying to get you off your path to steal your destiny and your joy and i can tell you right now it is going to happen what god has said yeah well you know i'm convinced you know they've been during this year whatever november summer january march we're about a year and five months almost one and a half years uh but there were times spent every few weeks after the election i'd start to sink and then i would encourage myself and the lord i would listen to one of my guests very closely and i got to the point uh i think i think something happened johnny and always kind of he said i want to go into the details but he said be sure careful who you're listening he wasn't talking about my guests he was talking about people that were talking from the outside because it will affect you and i said and i said johnny there's a part of me that you don't know yet and that's the part where a familiar old friend rises up it's like i just call it a backbone but this thing happened and the worse it got the stronger my backbone got and i finally got to the point and this happens to me in other places in life where that backbone becomes so strong you can't you could knock me down for an hour but then i'm back up i'm back up you know uh so it's it's interesting but uh he was trying to keep me from falling he didn't he didn't realize how strong god of a backbone god put in me and it's like that's right it would be like an anti-bully spirit that i was born with you know yeah so anyway that's that but well listen listen we got a couple questions uh a number of questions we got some time left here so i'm going to just read this one that's a little longer than the normal question but it says canada's reference is lynn kent has reference in the past that the father has a magnificent boardroom and he loves to plan at the time of creation when the word jesus spoke and it was so had everything been meticulously planned before being spoken or when creation was spoken did their all-knowing power just make it be down to the minuscule degree so this is trying to get a handle on what happened after they said did they speak speaking it was all done or did they go around creating things i guess that's kind of that's my interpretation of that that could have different answers to that question because i don't know because i'm a detailed person i don't know if they're talking about at the time of the original creation of the physical realm or are they talking of time between that time are they talking about right now uh that's a loaded that's like a loaded question well you know i think what i think she's saying is he's talking about what most christians are taught when in the beginning so we're talking about after the fall and after that junk then god saw the earth without form and void and then he says let there be light and i think that what she's saying is at that point when he said let there be lied and then let there be all these things did they just pop up because they had been meticulously planned and one word made all these details suddenly disappear i think that's what she's asking but go ahead however you feel to answer that they actually created by by not just speaking once okay uh they would go where there was nothing and the word who was with god and in god the father would say what he wanted and the word which is why his name was the word would step out and create the words he would create those words that's what he did he didn't just make anything anywhere whenever the father said he would step out of him of course they lived separately i mean they didn't have to stay inside but when they were going to create they were mostly together when they did that i'm not saying that the word himself couldn't speak and make things but god laid out a lot of plans he laid out plans but he didn't make every person choose what they wanted or not wanted that was up to man in other words this is god's plan if you agree to go with this plan then a lot of those things that he saw or thought of you would happen sometimes you yourself would delay things by the word you speak yourself or against yourself but as far as creation creation uh uh the life has always existed okay the father has always existed the word has always existed holy spirit has always existed the four living greeks have always melchized they weren't just like popped up somewhere they were always with them there was more than just them but who is god who's the godhead father son and holy spirit back then it was father word and holy spirit but between them everything was made that was made and it was done by speaking first god would think what do i want uh what do i want to do here and then he was speaking the word stepped out and made exactly what he had said that's how they operated they went everywhere they went they went in time out of time they went where they were at that moment and wherever they went and spoke it that did happen this won't happen um and that's how they created their soul lined up with the words and the desire they had their actions lined up with those words and by the way you're never going to get to create anything or inventing if you don't operate the same way i was in the mountains in north carolina the father said i'm going to show you how we created so it's really wonderful that they even brought that question up wow you when you begin to create uh and we will one day not people but we will be creators because we're the sons and daughters of the creators and so we will our soul will have to line up if we have a thought of something why and we we cry from our soul this is what you desire but your actions never line up by what you're saying like i want to move on a new place but you never do anything to show that that's what you really want you ignore it you set it but you do nothing about it it won't become anything that's so important that's really you build yourself up in most holy faith by praying in tongues but you also have to begin to believe that what you declare will come to pass and then your actions line up like you may start making plans for something that you yourself desire to do a desire to have that's in line with god not caring if you have it if you never do anything about it then you're not going to have it so if the father sincerely wanted something it actually says in the bible he would speak and it would be created if he liked it it remained if he didn't like what he saw when it was created then it didn't remain so just so you all know it's not like he practiced but he would start saying that until he got what he wanted to look exactly like what he said and then it remained interesting even they had a way they did things but they didn't just stand somewhere and say one word and it all happened no they went everywhere together and created all these different things uh but the spirit realm has always existed we're in the temporary realm we're in the physical realm so we can have these physical bodies but the eternal realm is the spirit realm and that's the unseen round to you if you died you see all of it okay if god allows you now you can see the spirit realm but that is the actual main realm that exists is the spirit realm and in that realm where that nothing is seen by man everything he made was in the unseen realm and then put in the scene realm and you have to understand you're a triune being they're triune beings but you have to begin to line up with the way god speaks and says things if you can't see him for who he is you will never know who you are so yes they went all over the place in a place where there is no time and began to create and make things and set things in place okay good good good all right that's really good cat um okay so this uh k warrior warrior i can't see the last name when angels are sent on a task from heaven does satan know that these angels were sent if so does he try to stop the angel from carrying out their task and how are these angels protected if they need protection that's another loaded question are you talking about the ones under gabriel you're talking about the ones most most of us don't know which are under gabriel you know we just say angels but so you you you know the difference you know gabriel has his own a set of angels is that right and yes absolutely gabriel gabriel is over one-third of the angels that would be the couriers the scribes um the messenger angels uh those who bring body parts down from heaven uh they'll their scribes they'll come record things and take them back to the father they'll bring messages from him so when they go somewhere if those angels are sent angels are sent on assignment under gabriel they always have members of the army called the host the army's called the host all of the hosts all the army is under michael okay he is the captain of the host jesus is the lord of hosts because he's over all of them but but michael when michael goes somewhere now if michael shows up the devil's going to be in trouble so usually when when guardian not your guardian angel by the way is under it's under um it's under gabriel your guardian angel is not a member of the host they're not that's why many many of them gabriels look like humans with wings or they hide their wings almost none of the army look like humans they're mainly look like creatures or part creature par part well you would call creature and part human but they're just the way god made them yeah and so but they travel they travel in groups like a host would never come excuse me just excuse me i'm excited well you know and uh yeah i don't want to mess up go ahead so whenever any of gabriels are sent to the earth with a message i mean they've been sent to me i mean god just has ways he does things i've had messenger angels sent to me by god and there were always two of the hosts with them to protect them most of the hosts don't need protection when they travel on assignment and if if we're commanding them they have right to go into enemy territory and take things back because we have authority and power over the enemy so this is a really loaded question but when michael comes and michael brings the army they're not going to have many issues they'll be attacking the demonic army they're coming to attack the demonic army uh but when i i've seen like scouts are sent out around to the atmosphere here and they watch activities of humans that are doing things wrong and they always have army members heaven's army members with them so if it's part of gabriel's group coming no matter what it's for they always will have part of the army with them and you all know you know daniel was waiting on the answer to his prayer and the angel finally came he said well i came but i was stopped he was stopped by part of the army of darkness but then michael showed up okay when michael showed up that whole thing was all over and therefore the messenger was able to come and bring the answer so you can see places in the bible actually the protocol they have with all that so most gabriels come on their scent even over the earth or from heaven to earth they're always going to have part of the army of heaven the army is called the hosts yeah and now this and and the other part of this question is and maybe let's talk about this for a minute because we talk about the devil this and we we cast the devil out but he is not omnipresent he can't be everywhere once he i think he has to do one thing at a time or give him one command at a time so when she says does it does satan know if angel's been sent on an assignment he may know he knew something was going on with daniel but right now there's 7.5 billion people on the face of the earth he probably knows very few things compared to the things god is doing right how would you describe when whether we re just satan or whether we're resisting the demons he sent or is that all the same [Laughter] complicated questions a lot of questions uh if you understand how that operates it helps you to answer a lot of the to have answers to the questions okay there's great daughters there's darkness on the earth right now it's not the great great darkness by the way because i've seen those times in the future so i know what you you may think it's the end but it's not the end just so you know that but we by jesus christ has been given power over all the power of the enemy that means any of them any of them but but when you ignore them or you pretend like they're not around or you're living a life that is filled with unrighteousness you decide to sin a lot and stuff like that you're actually going to attract the enemy to you because they know you're a believer but you're sinning you're going to be a target and and some people are more dangerous against hell than others so they will be watched more they'll have uh they'll have like scouts from hell watching you but if you have enough army around you they'll they'll beat them up and get them get them out of the way away from you so they do have a protocol how they operate but hell knows when someone's been sent when they're when they begin to fail in their attempts of what their plans are they make plans too they make plans like to affect different places in the earth or if they're going after certain specific areas in the earth like they may try to get the ukraine right now or afghanistan and when you see these things when you see war or destruction happening hell is always involved they made plans for that to happen they sent evil wicked beings out to get these other people to be wicked and evil to bring war or hate people uh that's all operated by hell and so our the army of god is always on the ready when the father sends them where the lord sends them but it's a different time for us now for us as believers to command the army of heaven and if you are it's going to be really hard for the any demon or the even the enemy to try to get in to attack you so i can i can just say this hell knows when something is going down because they see activity in the spirit realm unless even that can be covert even the way they come into the earth the father can hide the host coming into the earth the enemy's not aware and then all of a sudden there's a bushwhack and he's had all things set up like all the stuff's going to start happening and wickedness and all of a sudden his guys start getting taken out i mean the hosts are appearing they're battling their warring against the the plans of of hell and satan and they've already lost that battle before it began in the natural realm they have lost it in the spirit realm so i can tell you they know when people are saying things you know what hell's afraid of your word saying that you are above and not beneath that you have a dominion over him that you belong to the father he's got plans and you are for his plans regardless of what's going on when you begin to say i choose to believe god he knows what's happening i'm a part of what god is doing i'm not taking anything you know of the enemy i serve the living god that terrifies hell you terrify them and you're never going to heard them say that to you but they realize they're not getting you they're not getting your attention they're not getting the reaction they want they want fearing you they know when they're doing a good job when people start getting afraid or or they begin to attack one another or you know bash people with their mouth then what hell's planning is being effective the way that satan knows his plans are working is by what you respond yourself in your life every day what you're saying what your choices are that's the only way they know that they're getting your attention or they're using you when you begin to praise god under people saying the best praise god praise him by saying who he is and who you are belonging to him and so when the people when people begin to understand no matter what's going on in this physical realm when you stay your course and say who god is and you're trusting and believing him those demons will not want to be assigned to you why because they're not going to be productive they're wasting their time and know satan does not know everything he doesn't know everything everywhere that's why he has he sends scouts out he signs up demons some he won't waste on people if he already knows that they're powerful in god he's going to find people who are weaker that he can get to hate each other or kill people or or go along with the lies that are being given a lot of deception is in the earth that's one of the biggest things that satan is using right now it used to be fear numbness deception and so make sure you're not listening to the wrong words or agreeing with those wrong words make sure you stay your course and you agree with what god is saying in his time this is god's time it's not hell's time and so yes the enemy only knows you successful by what you say if you say the opposite of what the line cheating people are saying if you for life if you're for justice if you're for liberty and freedom they are failing all day long on their attempt to try to get you to believe a lie then they will be withdrawn and they will be sent somewhere else but no he satan has a lot of couriers himself and sometimes they fight each other because they don't want to be blamed for failing on the mission they were sent against so hell is not nearly as organized as heaven is obviously yeah if you even get in line with what god is saying and understand that what you say can bring a life to people and hope to people you're not supposed to bring fear by agreeing with all the stuff that's going on uh whatsoever you think or are in your heart that's what you're going to be satan knows he's failing when he continues words of hope and power and dominion from you he knows he's failing miserably yeah now cat just to recap for some that there's always new people every every day every year so i you talked about we're in a different time now and i'm going to just say it the way i understand it somewhere between 2012 and 2014 god came and introduced the host initiative to you i'm guessing he did this with other people on the earth i don't know that he did but but you know he came to you so when you say we're at a different time are you referring to the kingdom age that you said we started operating in in 2012 or are you saying when the host initiative was introduced where we began to be trained to fight or to to send our own hosts or all of the above what just and in 2012 really is what kicked the whole thing off and i do know as as a prophet of god and a revelator that we can feel things coming we can feel moves of god coming and even talk about them that's what a prophet does they'll talk about things before they happen i begin to feel um i say this way i didn't feel impending doom in any way ever okay because i don't agree with doom i don't agree with gloom or fear uh the only one who's gonna fail so miserably he'll wish he never made an attempt to do anything that would be hell that would be satan they're they're gonna fail let's just push us button [Music] that's now this is what that's what hell is going through right now you know i mean god's pushing his fail button up there and everything they're doing that you can't see right now they're failing miserably because they're afraid right now more people in the body have are coming together and powerful things are happening in meetings outside of meetings hell doesn't want to see that they don't want to hear that report and that's why the news the natural earth news won't report it because then you will understand that a lot of the plans that persons sitting illegally illegally in the white house they're failing at what they want to see have have done and if you think god is about to have the life taken he set himself their time their birth on the earth have them taken right before they come then you are very wrong i think some things are about to happen in these places where they do that babies i think terror is going to start falling on the people the terror of god is an actual thing that's not you being afraid of god that's terror coming out terror of god coming on people who are wicked and evil that he is putting there letting them know you better not go there you better not be a part of that and so i think this world is going to get a really big taste of the father son and holy spirit more than they ever have before um so i i want you to know that you need to trust him if he's for you and not against you why would he want the earth destroyed if he made the earth for his own purposes to send us from him so you would have this physical body and not just a spiritual body and he gave you a destiny and a call and anointed you for this time why would he let you fail he isn't he's not going to let you fail so i know i probably went beyond all that but no no that's good right here the holy spirit is telling me say this say to say this right while i'm speaking because he wants to encourage and empower you it's nice to be inspired you need to be empowered that's good and and uh can i just play a little elementary school here for this because it's nice to be inspired we're being inspired today if someone's sitting there going okay cat just said i need to be empowered how am i if someone's watching right now and they're going what what what do i do what does that mean can you you just jump off on that one and tell people how do they get empowered because i know you know what it means yeah and power is taking you to an a whole new place in god is you're finally going to step out and begin to understand how wonderfully and perfectly you were made that god does have a purpose for you or he would not have sent you from himself during this time you need to believe what the word says believe what the bible says and uh if you just look up the some of the normal promises that people would say normal promises that he meant for us to rule and reign with with christ now in this life and in the times to come you're sent here to rule to be over to not be under you were sent here to speak into the earth itself uh that's who you are you're a son or daughter of god not something in between by the way you're one or the other and you're who god made you to be and so when you get off that track and begin to look well will i find god in this religion will it find him in his false religion will this one help me i'm talking about the one who made everything who lives in heaven who sits on the throne with his son next to him you have to believe just the basics and begin to understand this is real this is all real that's happening and you want to know him more i would say the most important thing is even say i want to know you more you say that to him yourself i tell people you don't have to get in a position you don't have to have to be in a church to do that get in a room and shut the door and say i want to know you more i need to know you i need to know your ways i need to know your thoughts i want them show me yourself show yourself to me let me feel your presence so i know that you're here and i'm telling you i did that every day i can't tell you how long i did this was like 20 30 years ago and then he began to show up and i mean no i didn't need to know anything to tell me that it was him that it was the son of the living god or it was holy spirit or even the father would show up you know what because i want what they want i'm totally against evil wickedness against hell uh satan is your enemy he's everybody's enemy he's the left enemy he's the right enemy he's a conservative it doesn't matter who's on the earth the enemy of every human on this earth is satan who either use you try to wipe you out and yet here's god who made you and has a purpose for you in this earth you need to know him so you know who you are because man sometimes it doesn't even know who you are the pastor's come down and doesn't know who you are and probably would even disagree with the very words i'm speaking although they're in his word it says man shall not put my bread alone that's the written word but by every word spoken by the mouth of god so yes he does say things that don't go against his word so that you'll know who you are what's going on in this time what's really happening that's why he has prophets yeah you know i always write and can for those of you that maybe you were you're just new and you were raised in oh just a normal baptist methodist whatever the church would be but the generalized teaching was once the bible was codified in 307 a.d god decided okay i guess i'm not talking anymore that's they don't teach it quite like that but that's the effect they say it's in the bible now if it's not in here you can't have anything to do with it so god's going okay so i guess i'm supposed to not touch anything and to say anything and god won't be kept in a box but it's fun for a while until you realize there's really no power that's why masses of those denominations went out and found god you know not just incarnate but god powerful you know anyway uh we could talk about that for a long time but um yeah okay i won't get too far but let me get another question here um here's a question about heaven cat do people plant seeds ann is asking in heaven to grow things on earth we have seed time and harvest but there's no is there if there's no time in heaven i wondered how it works and how do people plant seeds or you just go flowers bee or what what would happen if you're gifted to be a farmer you would totally plant seeds but they come up immediately okay you said the key word there is no time so you don't wait you don't wait for them to say it that's the creating part i talked about and heaven will uh you'll have seeds and you plant what you want but your flowers are going to be like five foot tall they'll be talking or they'll be singing you can make hotels and melons and arrangements so that's why one question can go into all that oh so yeah they'll even they'll even kill the ground of heaven because they like it they don't have to farmers there's huge farmers farms all over in heaven and people love to go visit them maybe you don't want to be a farmer you don't have to be one but if that's what they were called to be in there some people anointed to be farmers you know or they build cars they design things they they create music uh you have a gift sometimes it's the culinary arts heaven totally agrees with the culinary arts in heaven and so whatever that gift you are if it's the thing you're passionate you talk about all the time think about it all the time in heaven that's what you will be so even if you never got to be a chef or have a restaurant or do something great with that but you make the best barbecue ever on the face of the earth you're probably going to have a restaurant well you'll have barbecue things are done rapidly you don't have to wait you are that gift you come to heaven he's put everything on your mansion you need to be that gift so farmers already have a lot of land sometimes even the angels have tilled the ground for you and then you decide what are you going to plant you go then plant it and then you turn around and it's there and then you harvest it and you make arrangements or you do stuff with wheat it's magnificent it's it's way beyond your life here i get confused from time to time because you you have clarified that your gift isn't necessarily what you do but i've discovered that sometimes people's hobbies are what their gifts are they'll do that and have it sometimes people what they do farming is a is what they do but you're saying that's their gift and someone wrote today on my list here and they said i'm an accountant and i love accounting what do i do and have it i'm sure you won't be counting numbers no or will not nobody has bank accounts in heaven you don't have finances you don't have stocks to exchange like that you have wealth in many different ways in heaven but you're not going to be counting that if you like to count things i'm sure he's got many things up there he's meaning for you to count and write it down i will say this god does love to write things down he's the writer jesus is the speaker jesus never liked writing in school and he always has this joke that that's why there's only 10 commandments and not 20. he didn't want to have to write 20 down on this stone so we put 10. but the father loves to write and he likes to record and put things down so if you love that and that is a gift that it's your passion if it's your gift it's something you will love it's not going to be a dredge a burden it's probably not what you're doing for a living on earth you have to make a living to exist but in heaven you exist to live and this one with accounting she's made the point that she loves loves loves our accounting so you're saying you god will let give you many things to write down and take it make it yeah if it's him or whatever that whatever they are he absolutely will put them in charge of some place in heaven and they may count all kinds of different things and keep track of that and even report to him with what they've got it's not like he doesn't know but because that's their passion and he wants them to use that gift um most accountants i think will probably be playing golf or uh we're going into car shows or something like we said like steve said the job you have now if you if you don't like it you're not happy with it that's definitely not your gift if you're if you're blessed enough to the gift he made you i am a photographer okay in heaven i'm not going to be a revelator he won't need me to reveal heaven you'll be living there but my gift i was sent to the earth with is a photographer it is my passion every time i look at something i wish i had my camera i could take that i could create something i create moments in time with my camera it's my passion it's what i want to do all the time but i had to lay that down as far as a business would go to do to do this for him but in heaven i'll be a photographer i'll have my own studio come by and see me i won't charge you anything that's good um okay so can i uh can we ask this is tammy can can we ask our angels to help us in our daily life with physical help that is needed for example to move something that's too heavy for us i don't know i mean okay you'd have to be in a different realm to have an angel lift something for you so how would you respond to that i think that is something that has come i just have to say the truth that is coming it is okay but you have to be uh knowing christ is the beginning receiving christ is just the beginning of your life it's just the beginning you need to pursue him to know him himself more than anything else it says when you seek for me with all my heart you will find me when that happens you again and it really comes from a desire to know him to be with him and and and he'll open doors that were never open for you before but this whole thing about moving things going in and out of the spirit realm uh if at one point the bible says one person will speak to a mountain and demand it to go into the sea and it will not will be up rooted it will go and see that shows you right there there's coming times on the earth well yes that will happen i'm not saying you can run out there and practice and hope something doesn't fall on you that's not what i'm telling you to do don't jump off of a building to see if you can fly yet uh usually god himself will introduce these things to you but but the more your faith is built that's why it's important and i think things at one point on the earth will be so fantastic and amazing and great people will maybe i'm not saying now even i'm not talking about even 100 years from now i'm saying even beyond that that the earth will be so different and uh war will be little at some time a lot of things will be so available to people at one time that people probably won't need to use their faith as much okay don't ever stop using the faith he gave you and letting it grow because then you you at one point be depending on what you can do yourself for you i'm talking about supernatural feats i am talking about that and uh so it's going to come at one point on the earth we're just now stepping into a realm of knowing that we ourselves are supernatural people if you're born again you're not normal and there should be things not normal about you the way i speak is not normal but actually this is normal in heaven to be the way that i am it's called heaven culture so that was not uh really an unusual question yeah and and in church history they actually have recorded that there were times and i think some of them were children they would end up rising above we don't use the word levitate that we're levitating like the enemy tried to do something but there were some who found themselves a few inches off off the ground and do i understand that that has happened to you before yes i walked down there okay do you want to say any more about it i want to say one thing i want to say one thing first i'm talking about the celtic saints people i'm not talking about people i'm not talking about the druids and i'm not stop always bringing helen that you're like they're the ones who only did supernatural things uh but even back in the day when they when the druids and all these people i'd say this is probably what 300 years you know from the birth from the birth of christ or something like that or or maybe the death of christ i'm not quite sure about human dates i don't do well with human beings i just know god's timeline okay back in the day i guess probably in the dark ages what they call the dark ages when so much witchcraft abounded and warlocks and wickedness and evil by the way those those things are still around even today uh and they're going to try to make themselves look good eventually that's just a free tip for everybody that's that's coming too but god did supernatural acts in those days with people and the celtic people i'm talking about ireland scotland well the welsh people had so many supernatural things going on there was an island where some of them lived and they would this is this is their own statement recorded there's like 2 000 step tower that you have to go up to i don't think you could make yourself up there would you however they did in days and when their face was great and the statement for the people who still keep those places where the celtic saints lived like colombo patrick and those people who did know god and loved god and they were in the company of angels many times and they did supernatural things like just go out to sea and there was no steering the boats and don't go do that yourself because i said that i always have to make sure people want to throw the stuff out there and do it now no people will be rescued you don't want to do that but i'm telling you the way it was back before those things were beginning to happen again but in this place um i think possibly people be looking now in the one star wars movie they actually usually replace i think where those things happen some of these things happen yeah an angel some angels were assigned to help the people who kept those places we're talking about hundreds of years ago and they would say they had statements like well the steps were very hard but god would give us the strength to go up there unless we had a good day and we didn't have to walk we went to the top really that means yes they went themselves and they had enough faith to bleed to go up there so if you think you don't need faith you better hang on to faith and you better start building that faith because there will be supernatural acts it talks about the signs and wonders in the bible never seen before those things are going to happen on this earth that's why jesus isn't coming to rescue you right now he wants you to get your crown on which pen i'm actually wearing that says get your crown on because we have to rule in this earth and declare things in the spirit realm as kings as priests and see things immediately begin to happen in the natural realm it starts in the spiritual realm and then it comes down and in then it will be manifested in this physical realm but there were people back in those days that did supernatural things all the time because their faith was great because they were hearing god and there's so much activity around you and choices around you how much time are you going to give god for you to just hear him because i know he never has stopped speaking yeah did you did unless you said it really fast did you talk about what happened to you where you found yourself with some air did you see yeah no and jen was my witness when it happened so i have witnesses that saw me walk here i i go to reno every year and speak at this wonderful place and um we we had a ride but the week before is the most important part of this the week before and this is what i mean about you passionately it says in the bible uh from the time of john the baptist until now the violent take it by force in other words john the baptist also did supernatural things he was a supernatural person and his faith was great and so from that time of him believing and trusting this is while he i think even before he actually revealed that jesus christ was the son of god he lived in that place with god he walked in the spirit that's the place i don't have time to explain that right now to you but he believed god in what god said he did and and actually god has always said you need to know my ways because if you know his ways you're not going to be making a lot of mistakes or wrong choices all of this is always going to be geared towards knowing what god wants but i did learn that the more passionate you are when you do clear things and then your soul begins to accept that this is what is wanted and then you make it known you say in the spirit realm things begin to happen to you to cause that thing to happen so i felt about a week before and i rarely fall but i fell and when i got up i declared in the public this will never happen to me again and i was i was just making a statement if the angels or the host have to bear me up so my foot does not hit the ground i will never fall again when i said that something was written down in the spirit realm that i said that in faith fiercely said it that's the violent the violence isn't like killing people it's you passionately and fiercely declaring things that you begin you know this is what god this is what's going to happen when god says command ye me what he's actually saying is let me see you command so i was putting a statement out there like i will never fall again no matter what has to happen i won't fall one week later we are in reno headed towards the green room i did not notice that there was like a foot and a half drop that we had to step off on onto the floor and continue on i never stepped down i just kept walking and jen is behind me and she starts yelling you're floating on the air and and i i've had my ipad in my hand pastor in front of me and i said no i'm not you know because we get you kid each other sometimes she said no i'm serious you are and i had walked like eight feet out just out just walking out i couldn't feel anything under me but i was just going forward and and finally she goes she says stop and look down you are walking on air and when i look down i was walking on the air had been walking on air across this big space and i was standing on air there was no water but nothing beneath my feet there was no club beneath my feet i would i would have fallen on my face in the natural i would have stepped off and i would have fallen flat on my face and it was concrete it was like a stone floor and i had my ipad in my hand and i was so focused on sharing just the things of god revelation with his pastors walking in front of me and all of a sudden they look down and i'm i'm standing in air not touching it and this is my first thought wow is this what it was like for jesus when he walked on water i mean that was my first thought and and i said no this is a greater work jesus could feel the water under his feet do you feel the air this is him talking to me while i'm standing here and i went no i don't feel he said well get used to it and then i looked down again and i didn't really actually hit me i was saying and i went and just really slowly slowly i went down to the floor yeah and i began to shake and jen was shaking by the time he got to the green room we couldn't have stopped shaking and the pastor goes what's wrong with you jen goes she was walking on there and he goes and i missed it can you do it again for me yeah it doesn't work it doesn't work that way does it wow you know you know i was a ch i was like elementary school summer was showing me us kids at school at christian school but they somehow there was an article about and they were children who were preaching and they were documented to have been in the air when they were the anointing came on him and this was in a very you know fundamental type school it wasn't like the kind that would normally even teach that kind of thing so they taught it and i and i've never forgotten it so when you're telling me i go yeah i've heard that i heard that so that i it's really easy for me to believe i've known that since the child now i've never felt it yet but and you know we've all heard stories of if you know i've heard many stories about people saying you know they were it was supposed to be a two-hour drive and all of a sudden 20 minutes they're there have you had that happen before yes i have yeah i totally have had that happen we were like uh we had just started out on a journey uh that would have been like eight seven or eight hours and like two hours later we were there we just were pulled up you're traveling in the spirit realm is what you're doing you're being accelerated through the spirit realm and what happens is it looks normal outside you then all of a sudden if you look up you notice you're there i don't know any other way to explain it i do know that that is what has happened is that you're actually entering into that spirit realm where there's no time or space or distance yeah and that's what jesus did it when it said he stepped on the boat and the vote was at its destination when he stepped on that boat it was accelerated in the spirit realm and immediately they were there that is going to start happening a lot more often i also had heard people talk about that many times but we have it seems very unreal it seems very unreal but you can't deny you can't deny that i mean and from our human perspective we want to we want to just we need to rest fast but other than the fact that we need rest there was no spiritual reason to get there fast he did it because he could i guess god did it jesus did they did it he steps under the boat from the water and apparently it's there yeah i think that uh jesus like anyone else uh he did learn those things probably from his father he would go away to the mountains to be with him and i'm quite sure that uh when jesus was born as a baby as a little tiny baby he didn't really know who he was for a while but while he was still young he did begin to realize this is who i am and that's when he he didn't get lost from the caravan he on purpose stayed behind the temple because the priests were questioning one thing after another here's this this young person who knows things they didn't even understand how he knew and yet that's when mary and joseph came in and said how could you how could you beat us or even he said i must be about my father's business from that time on he knew who he was and he did begin to do he did supernatural things that's not necessarily recorded in the bible that's how he knew to do them out in public i guess doing him at home is not a miracle but they called it a miracle when he turned the water into wine i know he did do that in his own home with mary and his siblings he did do that i'm going to ask you that and then this will be our last one but so when he did his first public miracle which was at the wedding at cana changes water to wine but you're saying he absolutely from time to time would work miracles when he was at home it wasn't the public right yeah and his family were not um taking another drink go for it his family weren't even overwhelmed that he could do that actually that's how mary knew to tell the people to do and he said what are you doing with me are you trying to put me out there before my time he knew what she wanted him to do because he did it at home and by the way that wine he turned the water into was heaven's wine it was not earthly wine it was heaven's wine wow that's why the guy at the wedding said this is the best i've ever had because it didn't come from earth and he did it at home so mary knew hey he makes it there she knew he supernaturally made it we can fix this problem if you just you know we'll go ahead and make it and he didn't want to do it thinking that he wasn't supposed to do it yet and yet he did it and so that was a good question about that and then this would be it when jesus clearly knew it wasn't his time or at least he clearly said it was this time mary clearly needed the wine has the lord i think he was healthy i think it was more i think steve i think more more than that i think mary did know it was his time she was more of a mother maybe more than she maybe more than he knew yeah i think he was he not that he wasn't he was enjoying you know uh helping people to know the truth he he loved doing all that but he didn't want to publicly be known for that yeah it wasn't like mary did not make a mistake okay that was probably the holy spirit or the father pressing her go and ask him go and say something say something and then tell them do whatever he says to do she knew what they were going to do get all the pots fill water she knew that water would become wine and yet she wasn't going to push him out there to make him ahead of his time she was actually opening the door so when he stepped through his life wouldn't be the same after that point that's interesting yeah and she never said please jesus please son we really need this he just said whatever he tells you that's right honor her too that's very cool all right well wow okay very good uh so tell people about your two websites before we close so they know how to get to you and what they can get from you we got revealing thomas on the screen yeah my website uh is revealingheaven.com it's also the name of my book which i always show people this is my book so if you've never seen it this is the wing of the living creature and on the back is the rest of the wing of the living creature on here and now that's so that no matter where they sit on a bookstore people are going to find out about heaven i didn't design that cover by the way that was orders from headquarters called heaven and so but revealing heaven.com is where we have products uh available for sale that and this cup which i always love this is the holy spirit's idea i don't do demons with a lightning bolt reminding satan he was kicked by heaven so we have all kinds of things our events will be put on there we've got a whole calendar made out now we'll be putting that on revealing heaven.com cat turd kerr.com is a whole different website and it's where you get a lot of revelation you can get training on how to do certain things in the spirit it's the father's spiritual platform to say whatever he wants to and it's also the only place you can give to me online in the whole world i haven't created any other place for that to happen and please don't listen to people who put my fake picture up somewhere and say you need to give everybody give to this orphanage in such a such a place that's people trying to steal money from you i don't i don't do that i do help places myself but i let god say what he wants to on on these websites they belong to him and uh but i appreciate everything that people do for me the prayers the giving i am blessed beyond measure that you love god like i do that you want what he wants i think the greatest reward is to get letters and notes from people saying how the life is changing living on earth like they live in heaven by walking in in the spirit and not in the flesh um i just am very grateful for that and i'm also grateful for you steve and all of your teams thank you and i know you all don't see all my team one day we'll have a party and just show everybody when we move into a real building we will do that but i do want to say thank you to you steve and i always encourage people please give to steve because if it wasn't for him you wouldn't have no there's other places i'm not saying there aren't but the doors he opens for the true prophets of god to let god's voice be said even in these days is very powerful and very important and he is special to god whether he'll say it or not i will so thank you from heaven thank you from the father son holy spirit steve all of heaven celebrates who you are uh even your father celebrates you and you i love that you're my fault my earthly father is there and my heavenly father so that's very cool that's right you know kat i did know she used to do that but we do have a a slide or a at the end of when as this goes off the air every week we have a donate link it's not clickable but you could write it down and stuff but we appreciate that uh there

believe they're all merged together rather than separate as clips you just go through the some of the shows some of the clips so the way if it's still the way that i last saw it so i forgot about that so all right let's bring kat kerr in here my my oh here she comes there's no picture i'm coming down here jeff uh i'm gonna it looks like her picture even down below is frozen in my little thumbnails so i'm gonna kick you guys out cat and have your people just come back in and she's gone there we go we hate to kick cat kerr off but sometimes yeah i was talking about the other day and it just went out when i was talking to robin i guess it was they they happened to be working on an antenna because i have a through-the-air antenna that comes to my house from a mountain top hilltop and they happen to be working on our specific wi-fi situation without realizing we were on the air and suddenly i was gone so anyway we hope they get the message to come back on i don't know if that was a slower connection that did that or just gremlins as they say so go ahead while she's uh i'm not going to be here on um come on jeff just come on so i'm not talking to a voice yeah a disembodied voice yeah yeah so actually i will promote elijah fire for this weekend because i'm going to be gone on friday and so is the location so um it is going to be amazing um saturdays is going to be andrew tau he's backing us a great word um about this year being a do-over year and it's a really powerful word we should we published it on the elijah list but he kind of goes into deeper um he delves deeper into the into this word so it's really great and then sunday we have micah turnbow who is has an amazing testimony he was a homosexual and the lord completely flipped his life around and so he's also a seer so he sees angels and all that crazy stuff it's going to be a really really really powerful show as well so i mean what was his name the last one you said micah turnbow okay all right yeah so actually krista elisha recommended him okay so talk to me while we're waiting for them to come on um so how long has elijah fire been going and how is it elijah fire has been going since september of last year um and then we officially broke away and we started uh we took a break for the holidays and then we started up again in january on our own channel um with your blessings yeah and and i always get confused how it's connected because if i can find it through elijah streams which i think i can then it's like somehow still connected to us yeah so it's still it's an extension it's an arm yeah so when you say our own and you use breakaway i thought no no jeff's not leaving us he hasn't started his rights correct talk about your plans for a uh for changing that to the week days and when how long ah in the future are we looking for that i mean we're looking at sometime in the next couple of months breaking away uh not breaking away getting away from weekends and going to weekdays and we're going to be doing live shows at that point as much as we can and so i'm i'm really excited about that we don't have an exact date where we're looking at that there's a couple of things we're hiring a new person to take over this which a lot of people are aware of at this point because i had to come on and talk about it um and so we hired that individual her name is emily she's amazing really talented uh so she's gonna be taking over all of my duties that were on this show so she'll be she'll you'll see her instead of me uh if there's a situation like this where cat has technical difficulties or somebody else so yeah and by the way and maybe michael can either come on the air but we're he says working on getting their cam and mike back so we don't have them yet we don't know how long it's going to be yeah so uh what else should we riff about what else should we we should riff about well i'll talk a little bit more about elijah fire while we're waiting um we're we're looking at adding in a lot more variety there's some stuff i don't want to say yet because i love surprises and i love you know i i'm i'm just that's the way i am uh and so uh but i'm i'm very excited because it's gonna be very much a lot of the um a lot of what is there already you know having conversations with different people but we're looking at bringing in a lot more variety in terms of our focus and uh there might be a couple of days where we actually shift into a specific focus one of the things that a lot of people who watch the jennifer martin episode know is we're going to be doing a series on deliverance and so i want to start doing that as different series that focus on different things on specific days and that really resonated with people it's a that's a very crucial thing so cat is here [Music] we got her back okay thanks jeff i appreciate it well we stalled and gave some good announcements chat in the meantime i guess they need to kind of square up your camera just a little bit there you're kind of off to the side you don't want to lose you uh so if anyone can hear that and there you go i feel so much better so what today my tie almost matches your hair a little darker i can see that we're getting closer so well it's good to be with you cat i'm glad we got you back where i thought i was beginning to wonder i'm going to run out of things to say here in a minute and so i know that's hard to believe if you knew me but i usually have something anyway so cat we're gonna jump into questions in a minute but uh do you have anything to see just tell what's on your heart and talk about anything you want to talk about current events anything before we do that well the only current current events right now of course is the convoy of the usa convoy i'm real excited they've already tried several ways to stop them it's not working um i guess they think that they can make an order and and you know we the people are actually going to listen to those who don't want this country who aren't running it right they still think that they can tell us what to do and i think those days are coming to an end very quickly because we the people are helping this trucker convoy in every way we can they try to shut off gas people bring them gas it's crazy uh they're sitting up even more and more people have had time and the canadian one of course we know that kicked it all off yay for canada i can tell you that i've always liked canada but but they had more time to plan this one in america because of the the canadian one going on so they learned some things from them and added some things of what they were doing but i love it that they actually were working together in a way to do this uh in an unplanned way but that was totally god having us come together you know canada and america to want to display that we're taking our freedom we want freedom of liberty and justice we've already made displays that we're we're taking our freedom and that's what we have that's what we deserve here in our country and actually every country in the world does you know they deserve to be free god made us his free people i don't even know if you realize this but god never intended to assign kings his plan original plan was not to assign kings over countries at one time they were demanding to have a king that's why people got salt it didn't turn out really well did it anyway so god had intended for man to be free and be accountable to themselves help one another that was what he wanted and of course the devil gets involved every way he can and uh of course the devil still thinks he's when he's won and this whole thing is not over but he already he should realize that the foundation they built in this uh fake administration and uh because of our our the stolen election and you know what i'm not the only one still saying that there's even papers printing in that there's even a few networks now saying that the election stolen i am so excited about that because it's coming to the day when as the father showed me they will literally have to say on those same news networks that went along with it being stolen they will actually have to say that they they had to admit it whether they wanted to or not that the 2020 election was stolen that trump is a rightful president and then he will have his four years starting from that time when it's recognized and announced and uh and judged that it was still and from that day they will have to give him four more years so i know everybody's talking about 2022 that's this year you know the midterm elections will be happening uh then 2024 is supposed to be another whole time when the major elections take place i think that's not gonna happen because if he gets four more years it starts it would start this year if that's when this happens then in this year they'd have to start four years four more years for trump that would even change the electoral dates to vote how about that that's how significant this whole thing is wouldn't that be amazing it would be amazing i want you to i want to clarify something so people get don't misquote you you kind of said um if that's what happened it sounded almost like you said that will be this year and then you said if that if that's what happened so are you saying that will be this year or you're saying if it's recognized understanding if that happens this year if the whole turnaround happens and that announcement is made remember god showed me he didn't show me the year it would happen uh he did of course show me on november the 4th that it was stolen but whenever that year comes when that announcement you just heard me say that will be an announcement that will be made when that day and time happens there's no way that they can escape knowing and understanding that the 2020 elections were stolen and the father showed me this on november the 4th uh you know when the elections actually basically that evening in november the third when it was actually stolen and they announced on november the 4th that the wrong person had um had won when that announcement is made on the secular television these are the words that they will say we don't want to admit this but there's no way we can get out of knowing and admitting that the 2020 elections were stolen and trump did win them those words will be spoken on the day when that when they realize there's no way they can escape admitting it i'm not saying those words will be spoken right now i'm saying they will be spoken the father showed me in the future the network's having to admit that that that even they have to lie about it by the way it will be known and justice will come he said everything will be exposed including that there will come a time and you will know for sure when particular people say those words we have to admit it although we don't want to that the 2020 elections were stolen and trump did win those words will happen i'm not saying now but when they do happen from the time that is admitted and exposed from that time they will have to give trump four more years now let me ask you a question kat um there uh there are people that say the problem with you patriots or the problem with eu trumpians or whatever name they would they would supply us they'll say is not only did god take trump away because you guys were looking at him as a savior but god's not going to bring him back because you're looking at him as as a savior instead of the lord how would you respond to that i would say this is god's will not man's god's will is he chose him and he's going to let him complete his next four years and he is still saying that to me i don't look at him as my savior right i know jesus christ is my savior i know the father god is his father i know holy spirit i know the divine trinity and i know what their plans are and they and fully intend for trump to have his second four year term and no one can stop that from happening not the devil not the left not mankind anyone is greater than god this is god saying this god is saying he will give trump his next four-year term when that is known and shown and exposed they will have to give him his second four years because it was stolen if something is stolen you have to give it back people you can't ignore and act like it never happened and go on with your life that is not justice yeah and the father has been adamant about justice being son no that was people who have minds who don't understand how god operates or when god says something he actually means it god has not changed his mind and so because man can't understand that they try to put their own they put their own spin on that well i guess this is what's happening and and because this didn't happen or somebody did this god changed his mind i tell you from the throne he did not change his mind about that and you better stop saying he did you can't put words in your mouth that don't belong to god and say it's god god chooses he chose that election was one and that is what we voted for over almost 100 million people voted correctly and the other side still hopes that they have trying to cover it up but we the people we the people have this country we say we want justice done and god is saying justice will be served concerning that 2020 election so i'd like to see some weaseling man stand up anywhere say they have more power than the living god they know more than him hey that sounds like satan that's what he's always thought and every time he has failed failed failed in his attempts to take over the devil doesn't get this country and he doesn't get the world at this time this is some of the greatest days we're entering into and god fully intends to work his plan guess what i side with god that's good good good good awesome cat really good um i have not asked you on the air or off the air um i suppose god doesn't tell you every single thing about every single issue you know but i have not asked you so i don't know if you have anything at all to say about ukraine has the lord showing you anything or simply not showing you anything about that i know the one thing he did show me was right before uh well you know what this is the thing about all that we do know the fake news is still being fake right no way they can get around it if you all have not seen the video where they're supposedly showing other people people who had died over there in the ukraine and had all these bodies neatly lined up in a row which wouldn't have happened neatly with a blanket laid over top of each one of them i happen to know when that when people are killed in war they're put in a body bag they don't have a nice little fleece blanket put over top of them and during the course of this reporter giving the report of all these people that died a mysterious arm came up from underneath one of the blankets because it was falling off of them and the dead person supposedly was trying to fix it with their live arm so what do you think is going on people they're still lying and they're going to keep lying i think god has a plan and always has had a plan for the ukraine i think at this time that russia does not want to take over the world i think that as long as there's a person whose name uh ends with um whose name last name ends with a t i don't think they try to do anything like that and so you can figure that out for yourself but i do know that god has many people in the ukraine and all people can seem to talk about as wicked and evil people everywhere in the world guess what there's more good people good moral people in this world than there are wicked the wicked the few the evil ones they're the ones you try to control that's what's in every communist country well i guess we got some music coming in here to celebrate we got all kinds of sounds going on today so i'm just saying i think a lot of that is being faked i'm not saying all of it is but what are you going to believe if if the ones who lied all along about everything else now they're lying about that i think there are some covert operations happening in the ukraine and i'm not going to say who's doing them i think during this this kind of cover thing going on with them i think some evil people may actually be removed in the ukraine that we're interfering with other things going on so i think that's more what's going on than russia just trying to come in and take over that country and i also may think i just can say this from my own thinking that there is always going to be a facade put forward through this entire um operation whatever you want to call it the fake operation i think there's going to be a lot of things made up and displayed that are not the truth so i think you know when you're going to find out when it all falls apart and justice is served in every line cheating stealing killing people manipulating person is going to be exposed as far as what the father is still saying to me and the father knows even talking about the near future that is great that is amazing that takes us accelerates us because of this time of the enemy attempting to take over god really is um i can't say he's behind it all i'm saying he's going to use what the enemy is doing to really expose who is evil so we don't have to wonder about that in the future who not to put in power whom not to vote for who who to put in prison i think that's more of what's going on i think it's all part of justice being served but if you've never been involved in law or investigations you really don't understand how these things happen so i think that god is going to make sure we never forget what communism and socialism is like who who do you vote for make sure that everything's working when you vote number one because this was not the fault to the people it was not the fault of the body of christ it was not the fault of president trump that this thing happened this was the devil literally trying to use wicked even evil people with weak minds to try to take over before his time literally that is what is happening therefore they have no power no right no authority not from heaven not really even on earth everything they've done has been stolen taken and forced upon people you cannot take a free country and say you're going to take it away from we the people who are free yes we still have our guns and says god said they won't get your guns they may see them but they won't get them i'll just leave it at that whole thing yeah that's good that's good well you know and i think both robin and especially johnny because he said this several times johnny andelo is if you know if you want to discern you're watching the news the regular mainstream news and you want to just discern what's really true ask yourself what are they desperately all the same channels all the different channels they're all they're all saying the same thing what do they want you to believe and they have right here normally when they're hammering something like that it's the opposite it's the opposite they're trying to create a narrative so i think when you know um putin's certainly not a lily white saint but i believe it will be found out that when he said we're going in for a military operation it will be found out one day that he went in for a military operation uh to remove some some bad actors that needed to be removed so and some of it i understand is hitting the media i'm not going to say it yet until i prove it's in the media but um it's and i was watching a report the other day not on the mainstream a guy had a list like this long yeah i ran out of time and every single item was the next fake picture fake picture video and this is where this was this fake picture and this is where this one you know the one where um zielinski is in a helmet that was a couple years ago they showed a guy in the tank that was a comedian posing for a picture not so little but another community picture after picture they said this is that and it wasn't that so i think that uh the eb person has put a lot of people on research duty you go through the archives of photographs especially military operations i think that's what their main thing's been going on right now is find whatever you can find that looks like it's now and that's really probably what they're doing to manufacture and make up things i mean people have known for years that you could fake photos and fake all kinds of stuff you can get enough people to watch like they were doing with the weather uh back when you know because we have been taking authority over the weather it's been very uh very different weather systems coming in now even around this country especially when they were trying to make it look like if you remember when that storm was coming that had begun to dissipate and that man had fans on him looking like he was going to blow over and behind him walking upright were two teenagers boy was that that was a fake one that was a fake news report i mean the guy is still acting like he's going to blow over and here's two teenagers walking totally upright behind him on purpose and the cameraman didn't see it so i think it's still a lot of that thing going on right now i do want to add this there are people in the ukraine that we know of who are giving us their own reports they're not the reports that are being given on the news so i can just tell you take it with less than a grain of salt maybe with more pepper in it okay because i can just say a lot of it is made is made up that they're saying because they want to put fear in you and yet god did not give us a spirit of fear but of power love and a sound working mind people so that's where god has got you if you don't have a spirit of power love and a sound mind you're listening to the fake news or you're listening to the devil it might be the both that's good good good well cat we can even talk about the rest this for the whole rest of time i guess we'll get into some questions if you're up for it all right so now you might remember i don't know if you remember i i had a word of knowledge uh and it turned out to be a woman young woman in norway uh her name is ellen she put that i saw a woman with a ski cap and this and you were just on the slope so she stays in touch with me since that happened and she i i'm gonna ask two quick questions for her she watches you i think she you're the only program she watches so she said our country has many words from god about a war that will come can we can we pray against prophetic words like that like a war is coming does he give us this information for us to pray so that would not happen or is he just warning us about what is going to happen um i think you can always pray against destruction um i think any any believer can pray against destruction uh god's intent is not to harm uh innocent people or have a war i do know that he has repeatedly told me there will be no world war three because that's what people started saying when all this started happening and god said no that is not true there will not be another world war right now i'm not saying there won't be skirmishes and that depends on what that war is all about and since i don't know that and he didn't he didn't say that to me the thing about answering things like that is he didn't tell me and he didn't show me okay and i i do have a lot of people wanting me to tell other people or actually everyone out there things they saw and heard and when i can't do that i'm a messenger for god i'm not a messenger for messengers and so uh i ca but but as far as praying you can always pray against destruction you can pray against the enemy's plans you can send the host to pull down any any stronghold trying to build an area that might want to bring war you can always take authority in that area um i think it will probably be between now and probably 2030 i think there might be a couple skirmishes in different places uh i don't think it's going to be full out war anywhere and i can't talk about that uh either because i just can't talk about it but i have not seen any great things of mass destruction happening um using a lot of these weapons that they've said could wipe out like millions of people at one time that is not going to happen at all and uh not not probably in your lifetime anyway we still have several hundred years left in this world and god intends for the next 100 to be so powerfully glorious over the glory the power the might of god the manifested sons and daughters walking on the earth they're actually here now uh starting to take authority over the land the sea the air mass destructions all kinds of things that they've been anointed and appointed to do that but we as a body should always be in agreement with what god wants god doesn't want war right now he's going to restore and accelerate for greatness greatness and celebration is what god is wanting in this time it'd be pretty hard for the devil to think he could sneak around god and pull off something but always if you hear even if it's a rumor you can always take authority over i take power over that uh rumor or that plan plan is a good thing to use i take part in over that plane to bring destruction to anywhere in any place at any time i come in the host of evidence you pull down the strongholds rip away the the lies that are being shown or anything that's being proposed that we could even people evil people that it fails fails fails in jesus name i think i think bob jones have every right to say that as a believer bob jones had a word and i'm just from memory but i think this is correct he people asked him he wasn't a weather warrior like you are that wasn't his calling but people asked him can you pray against that and at the time he said you can certainly pray the death out of it and then i think you as a weather warrior you actually did that kind of thing not only were you pushing the storms back uh but you would but you were praying the death out of that too weren't you uh so i brought that up at the same time as we're talking about a prophesied war if a storm's heading your way and the media is saying it's going to hit jacksonville where you're from that's a prophecy it may be a secular one but they're trying to prophesy that it's gonna hit if they if that were true um that's i'm just making that up that's not a real thing if that happened you would then just begin to instead of accept that okay guys there's gonna it's gonna hit you would start what how would you how would i take authority over that the that whole entire system immediately it's my right to do that jesus stopped the storms and jesus had authority over the weather over the water that he walked on i mean he had authority we have a right to do that to stop destruction you're right about that see if i'm not tolerating anything not just here but we actually have a whole group of tens of thousands of people who are weather warriors that are activated the minute anything comes anywhere pretty much around the world we have weather watchers who let us know what's going on if we're not aware of it so if it was headed here like it was a probably a few months ago they were saying a horrific storm was going to come and there'd be uh torrential rains it would cause severe flooding that that there would be you know the winds would come and cause great destruction and i said my first thing to that was no it won't i won't tolerate it in jesus name i take power over all the power of the enemy trying to bring destruction through the weather and i will right now speak to you and said you will not you will not be successful in that plan i take power over the devil i command the host of heaven to get in that system and begin to shred the bands of that storm you will not allow destruction to come to this area where i live i'm not tolerating it sometimes i go outside and i point my staff in the direction this thing is coming and i say you will become nothing in jesus name you will only come and bring a light rain a nourishing rain but you aren't allowed nor will i tolerate your construction to my city in any way whatsoever and i'd be coming in the middle of ours to begin to rise or lower whatever needs to happen and then the host will literally shred the bands of the storm like in the system and they will announce on the weather we don't know what's happened but now the system is beginning to break up so i guess we better remove those uh that torrential weather that's supposed to be coming and years and you've said recently that the what you just described is some of the activities of the manifested sons and daughters of god that when they're beginning to speak to mountains to whether so if people have asked the question what do i need to do to become a sons and daughters uh or manifested sons of daughters well you would start with that kind of thing are you right to take authority over the plans of the enemy and god actually said i'm starting with the weather that's what he said to me when he said this is what you're going to be doing before i ever started doing it he said you're going to start whether warriors and it will be the first time the body of christ from every denomination non-denomination or known denomination where they will come together for one purpose and that is to stop destruction of the storms and you begin to train them every time you go on the air you will have a weather warrior training session and then literally when a system started out and out in the atlantic ocean or coming from the other side of the tip of africa which is where a lot of the hurricanes come from we learned how to speak against them starting there and so many of them failed to get about halfway across and they become nothing uh or or you know what we've actually built a wall of faith all up the east coast here because so many of us we went to the beach wherever they were or held their hands out and said uh the father god made this earth when he put the water in the ocean he said a boundary said you will not go beyond this boundary you cannot come ashore it actually says in the bible that god declared this that we agreed with him and said you're not coming ashore no matter what you try to do there's no way you're coming in we're not allowing it releasing our faith in our trust that this is what will happen and they haven't had one literally come ashore since then it'll come along hit that wall and it will start up up back up into the ocean yes you have authority christ did it he gave us the right and the power to do that so that's what we do we're not allowing it awesome well uh ellen has one other question about the host i'm going to blend her question with mike with my question because i do every i think in big numbers whether it's dollars or whatever it is everything is big to me so if i send a host i probably send way too many uh because i just think why why waste the opportunity in case there's not enough so if i if someone would send 10 i'd send 10 000. it's just all right and then i'll tell god look if that's too many it's up to you to hold them back you know so then the other god's not going to haul them back steve well and then there's then there's this question which is the other side of the coin where ellen is saying how many hosts should i send uh for one person in other words a person that's in need i was thinking one host is probably enough for one person but then i started thinking that one person could have six thousand demons um so how do i know how many i should send and then she wants to know what if what about what how many should i send for a city with a hundred thousand people so that's the she needs to watch one of our events we will be having this year will be called the host initiative and you will learn strategies every kind of strategy for every situation you you can possibly think of that may or may not may not happen which would not be just the weather the host initiative which is is about um uh working with the army in heaven and commanding them i like how would you send how many for this what about this can we send them around the world so many of those questions will be answered and that's probably the only way we'll ever get to answer a lot of them is by so we're having a whole event called host initiative and that's really when you'll learn the most about it but i would say if you're sending them to your kids college to pull down drug trafficking or something like that you're not going to need a million to do that okay you might stand five or ten to do something like that if it's something trying to take over a city you then could think probably into the thousands to send them there i right now will send a billion i'll take and send a billion to the north south east and what that would be four billion if i'm covering the earth taking authority over a certain thing is going on i will do that and they will pull down every stronghold they come no matter where it is or how that happens they begin to shred the platforms of evil operating with the evil people and then the other thing i'll give them excuse me more than one thing to do when i send them okay and you can't i think for you you get so so excited about you have authority and if you send ten thousand they're going and i can tell you what you do if i'm sending extras you will then go into every street and uh hallway and alley in the city i'm sending them to once you complete that go into every street and every building and pull down every stronghold there that way the other ones have something to do that would be something we would teach you in the in the host initiative so you can always add to what you're sending them you may send them for specific things in an area but you can always send more with them to pull down stuff you can even say within 500 miles of where i set those i can send them to a thousand miles 10 000 miles and they will keep going until they have completed what you're given orders like you wrote them down you're the headquarters for heaven when you have an army you send them from where you're at you tell them what to do because we our military has to operate on on orders they can't make it up their cell it seems like you told me or us together that when you go out every you know dark in the wee hours of the morning to start sending the host which you do every day if i understand i think you described them as sitting there waiting with their hands folded was that you that said that your hosts were sitting there waiting well i was i kind of had this comical thought this morning whether that was you or or someone else if i was gonna send a hundred or a thousand and i decided to send a hundred i'm thinking here's 900 angels saying go send me send me send me because if i don't send them they're going to just sit there and do nothing so yeah they will be bored steve you you have an army from heaven that was assigned to you i have one assigned to me i can't tell yours what to do my i can't tell my husband's what to do he he has an army from heaven he sends on assignments to other places yes they don't want to sit there do nothing they were sent to you to command and send out so this is this is this is since 2014 when the army was assigned to us on the earth you have to invite them to come let me tell you there's so many parameters and dynamics to just saying that number one you can't be sinning they're not going to listen to you yeah you could have had an army that you've been commanding for five years decide you're going to live a life of sin they will leave they don't have to obey someone who's remember they hearken under the word of the lord that means when it sounds like things he would say the lord was pure and holy you know he is the lord of hosts he still is the lord of hosts jesus is still over all of the armies of heaven everywhere he knows when they're assigned somewhere he knows that we have the right to send them that if we would send them where they need to go to to bring um destruction to the enemy's plans to push crush back that the planes of of hell and yes that's going to affect the people in the natural who are doing it because you take authority first in the spirit which is the original eternal realm this physical realm was wrapped around part of it so he could make us and send us to this earth so but the spirit realm is the eternal realm that's what it is and that's where the army operates in yes they come to earth but the spirit realm is still around here and they operate according to the orders you give them and they cannot make up orders their self in other words unless you say something to your army like okay i'm sending you over here i've heard that there's new new um let's just say there's new terrorists moved into this area of america i would send like a hundred thousand because it was a great group coming in i sent a hundred thousand to pull down every stronghold of satan empowering them speaking to them uh revealing things to them so they could do evil deeds i take authority over the spiritual evil first and we have that removed shut the mouths of the demons they can't speak to the people who are doing these deeds take away the power that they're giving them and then they what happens is wicked man when they have no power they feel powerful inside when the enemy is helping them great fear falls on them and then after fear confusion comes so you are affecting this this world by learning to operate with the authority christ gave you to command the host of heaven you are making a difference i have a brother who would like rather just go shoot the people in the natural he's not really accomplishing anything because we rule and reign with christ in the kingdom he talked about which is a spiritual kingdom that has real positions real grounds real authority in the spirit realm and that's where you have to be able to see that this is what's happening but you do have a position in that kingdom jesus clearly talked about how important it was to understand that we may have to do a whole thing on just what is the kingdom they could do this this one subject the whole thing but you i it's very clear to me because i've heard you talk about it so many times they're not going to obey your command if you're in sin or you're sinning so that le you mentioned a little bit ago you could have had an army for five years that you're commanding and so my question is how specific is it so i'm commanding the army and then somehow without i i got into a fleshly place today and i got into a fight uh with somebody in a verbal fight and we just parted and i said some words with my mouth that effectively were cursing words i don't mean you swore to say they're just no good and then you forget about it when you do that anybody doing that you better nullify the words you just spoke yeah because otherwise the words will remain i'll go and play to hear words people spoke yeah so my question about the host cat is if you did that and you didn't nullify it and then a little while later you forgot about it and you're starting to send the host will they just sit there with their arms folded because they're probably gonna wait for you to say something it's not the same as going out and sleeping with everybody down the street okay i just get to be real blunt to me to save time if you're doing that your arm is leaving it's going back to heaven so i mean that's a lifestyle of sin okay if you do something it says we should always have a good report to give we should always have words that help heal and bring hope and joy and celebration and reveal who god is that's what we're supposed to be doing that's what jesus did but you know jesus was angry but didn't sin when he threw everything in the temple i mean he was mad he was mad he had had it with all the the cheaters and the steelers even he didn't like them when they tried to cheat the people buying the sacrifices he had just gotten it god didn't tell him to tear up the temple that was his decision yeah the courtyard the courtyard the holy spirit is now correcting me okay they taught the courtyard of where the vendors were i mean he threw tables people those tables weren't an inch thick they were made out of timbers he was strong he picked up probably six inch timber made out of timber tables and flew them everywhere and he was smashing stuff well he didn't sin because he that was righteous wrath that's not giving you the right to do it i'm only using it as an example okay god didn't hold that against christ he didn't withhold his power but christ himself could not have gone out and just killed anybody he wanted to uh that would have been wrong in his time even uh he couldn't go sleep with somebody which he never would have done and i'm not saying he ever did that he never did that there's a difference um there's a difference in being angry and upset and there's a difference in sin causes you to be unrighteous okay sin makes you unrighteous not righteous what i would tell people to do you know i've been upset a couple times with people and i'll just say even if they've walked away i may call them later send them in the text saying sorry i got angry uh you know i'm sorry i got angry that's all i would say but if i say words and i keep saying them it depends if you say something like you're an idiot you're stupid or something like that well maybe they are maybe they need with god instead i'll pray for them to have sound wisdom instead but there's a this this it's like there's a thin line in some areas but some areas you're angry you're upset about things you should always say for your own soul because you have to understand if you if you shredded somebody and you really just couldn't stand them you couldn't stay in them don't ever say you wish they would die don't ever say those words that's god's not going to do that if you say words and you know you said them then you say i nullify every word i just spoke in that situation i nullify everywhere and spoke over that person i i come in to be removed from the atmosphere and i loose it from my soul because guess what if you don't lose those anger words out of your soul you'll say them again because when they're in there you'll think about them the most important thing is to make sure you loosen from your own soul apologize to the person if you if you get the opportunity maybe it was on the road because i happen to know men don't like people to pass them in cars so they yell them you know they say things maybe they should i'm not saying curse words either we'll say profanity i'm not saying you use profanity but you know you you said some very unkind things to them you're not going to be able to stop them down the road down the road they'll think you're having road rage so no but you can say yourself father forgive me for being angry forgive me for speaking those words against that person i loosen from my soul and nullify the effect that they would have that's what you need to say that's good and so you live a lifestyle that and then your that's my lifestyle okay i don't keep anything in my soul that would interfere with my relationship with god or or the authority and dominion i walk in i'm not letting the devil get that away from me at all but he's not going to it's time for me when it's my time to send the host i will just make sure i've confessed i'll say forgive me for my sins lord known or unknown i just didn't just didn't want anything to get in the way of it well i have a question that's very wise t that's very wise okay well i'm not necessarily i'll do it when whenever something happens but that is a wise thing for people who don't think about that because they'll be sitting there staring at you they were there when you said it [Laughter] yeah okay well now um a couple of children's questions and then we'll go on uh to the other ones so uh this is a mom who's asking for her five-year-old son jase jace asked me if jesus hands still hurt from being crucified i told him they don't but i'm sure he'd love to hear kat tell jace the answer to this does jesus hand still hurt from being crucified they don't hurt jace because he's in his glorified body he's in his glorified body right now that that but that body that experienced that you know on the cross and the things they did to christ uh that body was buried his spirit man came out of that body of course and we know that he went into abraham's bosom he did different activities but but the third day in hell now in his spiritual body they didn't really hurt him at all those are physical wounds i have to explain those were physical wounds that were done to his fleshly body that body was in the tomb those three days that christ descended and he did things in his spiritual spirit man his spirit man was not hurting his spirit man was not hurting from the physical wounds he got that would be like saying you know you died and whatever let's say there was an attack in a foreign country and you were shot and buried in that foreign country but you're a believer and your spirit man from that point where that happened in the country your angels came and took you to heaven you wouldn't even feel anything at that time in your spiritual body so uh there's a difference in your spirit man and your physical man experiencing things but jesus right now when he came up out of that grave he picked his body up it was glorified that means it can never die he can never uh nothing like that can ever happen to him again you can put your finger through the hole by the way the hole i'm going to hold my hand up i'm trying to look at the camera and see see i'm not a technical person god didn't pick like the brilliant most brilliant people in this world person to give them 20 years of revelation okay it's like eight years old i saw his hand the wound is here it is not here if they had nailed into the cross this it would have ripped through his hand the wounds are right here uh but you can put your finger all the way through it you know and heaven he's got his physical body but it's glorified it's it's uh it'll it'll be it's um i'm trying to think of the word now it's eternal forever he cannot figure it out but you can put your finger in his wounds or in the hand in the side if you want to he's in no more pain at all he's still with glory and joy and celebration because of himself being willing to sacrifice himself for us so no he's not in any pain but you can see scars on that body because you know why he kept the scars there evidence that he did it almost everyone who goes to heaven they want to see the scarves that where he paid the price on the cross they all want to see when his hair blows you know you can see the little holes where the growing really that's together too huh wow yeah but they're not bleeding right right i didn't know you could still see the scars there those are his battle scars are you kidding me there's evidence that he actually went to the cross and he you're not proud of them but he's so blessed that he paid that price for us but everybody does want to see him and every time i'm seeing jesus in person you know if i see his hands i see the scars but he's not hurting from them jace he's doing great that's good all right now monique asked about her 10 year old son wants to know will jesus play laser tag with him in heaven that's it absolutely yes he will jesus loves to play with kids especially with children because um they're so filled with fun and joy and kids don't question things you know a lot even when they go to heaven they're like the thing getting in their head how is that possible you know how can you ride on light how can how can you swim under the water and breathe i mean how can you do these things but kids don't they just run they ride on the roller coaster that leaps off the track and does things i mean they ride on the wind they ride on the rainbow right kids are kids so jesus definitely loves to play with children in heaven laser tag would be a yes awesome awesome awesome all right myra asks cat cat said report that there's no dark places or night in heaven only a constant light emitting from the father but how do things look like they have dimension without shadows wouldn't a tree look flat uh without shadows how can you and then she wasn't how could you ever see stars or planets without darkness i guess you know i'm trying to shorten this but because it's god's house heaven the world heaven is god's home and he can display whatever wonders he wants to and there are places in heaven that you can step through a doorway and you're like it's it's a part of space but of course it's around heaven it's like you're not going to see saturn and stuff like that but you actually can see the actual stars like right from heaven you go to this beautiful place except you're in this whole part of the sky it's just some things you can't explain but there are ways to see and i can tell you the the bands of the rainbow that go around heaven looking for people to bring them back to god so we can visit with them that light is so vivid and i was taken the first time i went people think it's so strange i wasn't taken to the snowman in the first time they took me to a movie theater in heaven the first time i went to show to show me something number one people who are actors and get saved they go to heaven they still get to act uh you can sign up to be in different movies in heaven there's going to be no movies in heaven they don't have to rate them okay there's no rating because there's no defilement no pornography there's no profanity there's no sadistic torture those movies don't have them but they're exciting intense fun and amazing and i was shown several actors who had passed away and they were they were in heaven and they had made movies but approaching the place they took me to and even though there's light all over heaven sometimes the light is different colors it could be like peachy pink it'd be turquoise teals it could be purples light purples so you're not thinking about walking outside here and you see a sky that is just one color it isn't like that you don't step into just all light everywhere but there are no shadows and i tell you why because the light comes from the very ground of heaven the ground xenon has light coming from it so it would be impossible to have a shadow if the lights under the trees showing up through the branches of the you're not going to see a shadow under that tree but nobody cares about that in heaven they feel the wind on their faces the wind blowing all over heaven and beautiful wind um so that would answer the light part but the light coming advertising that you were approaching this big massive movie theater complex had places to eat it was there was so much fun going on there the rays shining from the building like different colored rays going back and forth in the sky over where the cedar was there's no way you can mistake that that was coming from that theater so it's heaven and because the father desires uh for things to be displayed a certain way you still would wonder that's what the whole wonder part is you're always going to look around you'd be so amazed at the wonder and splendor that is there now you you mentioned this is why you were talking this you mentioned about movies being made in heaven and so my generation would maybe want to know is john wayne making movies and when they make movies do they have a camera and do or is it one time i think you said you can act in it so do they film it and play it or is it live every time or how would you describe a movie in heaven they have a whole different way they talk about producing movies in heaven um it's captured there you go it's captured it's almost sort of like live stream kind of thing it's always going to be live action they don't have a back lot like hollywood does where they make fake screens but fake images on there oh no it's live and in action and i did see john wayne himself going across they have a whole part in heaven that looks like the prairie and he was on this horse and there was two young people behind him i think and maybe their dad who were in the movie with him and it looked so just like we were here it was wild and crazy and john wayne but he was young looking he looked like he was maybe 25 or something i don't know if people know he actually got born again before he died his daughter was present when that happened so yes that's what his gift was his gift was making movies and yes he's making movies they have just only a couple people present they don't need the big tracks with the big cameras and stuff they have one thing to capture the movie the other thing creates some music that goes with it and it's watched at the time it's being captured and you know that you're going to watch it so live action people and there's nothing more thrilling and exciting than to get to see something like that but if a young kid or an older man or woman whatever said man i always wanted to be an actor i just was a desire i never got to do it do they what happens in heaven do they get an opportunity yeah there's places actually throughout this massive theater complex it would look like it went for miles um and it had individual theaters and i love the way the father simplifies things for us although he he doesn't always explain how he does it we just i know he does it when you go to the theater there are these plays sort of like a kiosk type thing and there's different movies not every movie made it to heaven or they're making a new movie where you would have to look at the script which would be sent to you there's so much detail i don't ever get to share about that but let me tell you you will learn the part of the script that you're gonna do and then you will show up at the at the place at the theater where it's gonna be shown and everybody's gonna watch it they go in these double doors you go down the hallway in another door and you are in the movie at the location where it's being captured and if you were going to be in it you would go through that door your family would go in the double doors to watch you perform with john wayne or whoever else was going to be in that movie it's fantastic wow it sounds fun you know that's i don't know that i ever desire to be an actor but that sounds kind of fun i suppose anyone could try it whether they ever wanted to be an actor or not right they'd say i want to do that right yeah it doesn't cost anything and let me tell you you would already be in costume when you step through that door you would be at the location it was being captured wearing the outfit you had to have for that part uh like when i when i was taken there and i actually walked in the halls i saw the whole thing i saw where you sign up and people were laughing and giggling and picking up uh things that they were movies they wanted to be in and they just inform you they'll inform you okay it's time it's not time they don't say time your event is about to happen you need to get to the theater and then they would go in the spirit or somehow arrive there that's your notice that it's going to happen but you do get to practice and rehearse there are times for rehearsals and stuff like that except god has a better way of producing movies and a better way of showing the movies but afterwards everybody which i wish we could do here i'm the type of person that likes to celebrate every special thing i enjoy life and if i go see something that's good decent in all caps decent no profanity no sexuality nothing like that be involved in the movie uh i like to go celebrate that i got to see it i like to talk about my favorite parts in it and uh i would like i don't want to just let go home and like oh well like it never happened i am a person who loves to celebrate every everything in life that brings me joy excitement uh you know or uh revelation i love you that well in heaven you do that you all go out to eat mass places d in the theater everybody goes and they're laughing celebrating you that you had your first movie acting debut and sometimes the main person who was in it with you will come by and see you at your table and there's people out there laughing at me you'll be laughing through your teeth one day when you get to heaven so it doesn't matter to me what you think but there's a lot of people who are very happy that i'm given this revelation that heaven is 50 wonder splendor and 50 uh fun and there's so much there to do i know for years i've hear people say i might be bored in eternity just mine before the throne god would be bored okay and our father in heaven is not boring are you kidding and neither does jesus need his holy spirit but the movie theaters is something everybody loves to see yes there's more than one and yes they have many different places where they capture all these movies and the mountain of spices you know in the surf park uh in the prairie in that they have a um i'm telling what you call it now they have a rain forest in heaven a lot of things are made there the mansions are built into these massive trees there's mansions under the crystal sea so movies are made everywhere i call them made they're captured and shown i saw someone doing the sound of music literally this mother and her daughters came they went sat down she went through the door and on the screen it said the sound of music but it was their mother on the title page where they would show you know julie andrews made that movie on earth it showed her and so that was being captured somewhere in them probably the mountain spices where they have uh mountains and stuff and they were so excited watching their mother get to act and do something she's always wanted to do so so you're saying it would be kind of the actual sound of music movie but somehow all of the yuck was taken out of it and yeah the music was left in it so i'm thinking right now of jeff who's the face that came on a few minutes ago when and he loved star wars so does he get to be in a star wars movie if he wants and he can play the part he wants or what the one the one hi to your dog [Laughter] sometimes yeah tell us about whether you can even have a star wars movie in heaven i would have to say that does not mean every single one will be shown in heaven uh there's sometimes a lot of people make a good first one then after that i'm not saying star wars that star wars showed a lot of truth about the spirit realm it was always good against evil um i think i applaud george lucas for i'm sure that those scripts were downloaded from heaven um for him to make those movies and the popularity only grew but you knew for sure there'd no be no sexual scenes almost no profanity whatsoever and if there was like shooting and stuff it was usually like robots or sci-fi stuff things i'm not saying it's always okay to see all of it i'm not validating everyone ever done but i did see star wars one being shown in the theaters and people were playing luke skywalker they were playing princess leia wow well that's me so they and they can play the part i guess they can play the part yeah and i just tell people i don't mind saying what i saw i hear what i saw i say what i was told i can't repeat other people's stuff i can't take what they got and say this i can't if he showed it to me i'm allowed to tell you about it and i did see the first star wars movie which was always good fighting evil and and it's mostly family oriented stuff so i can't say every sci-fi movie was good everywhere made because some of them are darker and i don't go see them myself and and i've been meaning to ask you this every time we've talked about movies in heaven over the years if it was good finding evil are there parts that someone plays the evil part i'm not talking about with profanities some play dark v darth vader so they're they're they're playing the evil character in heaven or is it replaced with some other if you've seen if you even know how to answer well since i didn't see the whole movie i can't answer that question but i'm sure if they did we all should know you should all know darth vader ends up by being good before he dies there you go and if you if you notice the thing that always amazed me with george lucas was if somebody was taken out or they died in the movie if they were a leading person if they were good you always saw their spirit person like towards the end of the movie in the movie that's interesting and that was actually that's like reality really and that's kind of reality because your spirit person isn't dead it's very much alive and so that's one of the other things i liked about the movies was so much of it showed the spirit spirit realm part but you never saw an evil person reappear in the spirit probably because they were living in hell in the movie so i don't know i would think that but but you know in the one it shows a lot of the destruction to the evil ones that were in the one moving evil but the people who were good that died you did see them standing in the spirit smiling away waving at your family on there so that's amazing you're going to find out yourself one day when you go i'm just saying he won't let any evil fear a death destruction wickedness evil no witchcraft is in any movie in heaven so if there's movies been made about witchcraft you're not going to see them shown in heaven so i can just assure you because parents are thinking people always equate what i say about heaven to earth it's not earth heaven has no form of darkness evil wickedness hate uh there's no uh graphic violence of anything there's no fear or terror that's not there it's not gonna be there but but god is a storyteller himself his son loved to give parables it's another word for stories jesus told parables on the earth but even the father would tell stories and sometimes he tells stories he made up himself to share with us he's a storyteller he loves the arts holy spirit especially loves the arts and um so i can just assure you your family members aren't bored in any way whatsoever it doesn't sound boring living in light light comes from your spirit man so even people have light coming from them who moved to heaven you still recognize them and know them though and so you just think if you belong to jesus christ you can be with your family forever and even those who recently passed i want to encourage you to say they moved you don't you don't need to say you lost them because they're not wrong they're not missing somewhere their body may be somewhere maybe you had it cremated it's okay god said he can put the ashes back together on the day of the dead and christ will rise a lot of people try to equate in their own head or try to assume things but they're living a life they never could live in heaven in heaven you exist to live and your family member has joy celebration they love you more now than they did before even if you argued you won't argue in heaven people will love one another and um they can't wait to see you again one day but they know you need to live your life you need to go forward with what god has for you and be what he called you to be on this earth that's why he sent you that's so good i want to ask the question it's popping into my head so i'm not gonna i'm not gonna i think it might be the lord um i had a situation where there was a it was a prophet but there's been thousands i'm not trying to name anybody he moved to heaven but before he did that there was things that he did that weren't very good and it involved me and so i and of course i've forgiven him a thousand times and i know he's in perfect bliss and but when we get to heaven what will that be like will i even think of that or will i just see him and go and hug him or what what would that be like if for people and their last their last connection was negative towards that with that person it's not going to still be in their soul like the emotions won't be there and sometimes they will apologize they'll say they'll say things like i'm sorry i hurt you and you don't even care you won't care okay for you it's like it's gone you know you're so filled with life and joy and people think you have no memories well you do have some memories when you go to heaven it wouldn't be kind of fun if you didn't have some of your fun memories and stuff like that at the very end of the bible when jesus says that he will wipe away all tears and you and the former things will be remembered no more yeah those are anything any tragedies any traumas or things that happen that now in heaven if you think about them it doesn't affect you at all but at one point in your existence with god he will remove all of those old memories and they'll be like they never existed but i want to tell people also uh we'll have to talk another time about the great the difference between the great white throne judgment and the judgment seat of christ those are two different things okay and uh we won't talk about it today because we don't have time enough to talk about it but those are the two different things one is for the lost those the judge the great white judgment is only for the wicked uh and some people seem to think we won't talk about that right now the holy spirit well you know and i i want to bring that thank you so much for that we will talk about that one day i feel like there's a bunch of people out there they've looked forward to having but they're kind of going if so and so is there because i've had family members do this if so-and-so is there i don't even want to go i just don't even want to go if he's there if she's there and yet what would you say knowing that that person is there i don't even know how to ask this question but but i mean i keep sliding off my stools i mean i'm so excited i slide forward on my stool so there you go so i think the question is what would you say to them how to handle that now when they're feeling like you're probably if that person's in heaven i don't even want to go to heaven and they'll they've said those words yeah your words are so important they leave something in the atmosphere around you they will affect your own soul you don't want to do harm to your own soul let alone other people's but you don't want to do something that would um keep you from your full destiny and i would say this if you're saying you don't want to go to heaven because there's a person there that did something wrong to you or a person you thought was wicked evil but they got saved and they're in heaven you're not god number one god desires that none should perish and i'm not saying that heaven would be full of everybody that's just not going to happen and some people think nobody will stay in hell if you go to hell and you live in hell you're going to the lake of fire after that so you don't want to go to the other place this is my point if you you're so adamant about how you feel against that person and what they did against you christ was being tortured on the cross you need to leave you if you're a christian you need to use him as your example you're not jesus you're never going to be jesus but we're supposed to be like him and if he could say father forgive them they don't even know what they're doing that he was paying a price so they would not have to live in eternity in in utter darkness or flames he's dying for those people who were tormenting him and he had enough of him left in there saying forgive them father uh they don't know what they're doing they don't know that they're the very one who's coming to to take the place so that they won't have to suffer they won't have to go into hell uh that's why he's dying for them then you with your own will leaving all of your emotions aside because your soul is made in three parts you have a mind what you think about you have a will what you choose which is one of the most important parts you have then you have all the emotions you display and what you're displaying is what is in your soul so what is coming out out is if they go to heaven i don't even want to go there i don't want to be any way around number one you probably never even see them having so massive number two is this if your if your focus is jesus christ and you can say i don't want to go there because they're there what about jesus are you going to abandon him do you not want to know the father who carried you inside of himself for ages before he was sent to this earth do you not care about them or do you care more about making the others feel like they're so bad i don't want to be with them you need to look at it from every point of view you're really literally saying to the father they're so bad and hurt me so bad i'm not going there because they're there but what about the others what about your family that you do love what about jesus christ he paid a price for you okay if you if you received him as your savior and he wiped away your sins why are you holding grudges against somebody that is the enemy who's talking to you and you're listening the first thing you should say is to yourself i don't i i know by those words i spoke i don't wish evil against anybody but when you're saying you don't want to go to heaven there is only one other place to go so what you're actually saying is i'm not going to heaven because they're there so i guess i'll go to hell oh no you don't want to go to hell nobody loves their everyone hates everybody tortures torment torture torture torment you're saying i'd rather be tormented myself in hell than be in heaven because that person made it you're literally saying that so if i were you i'd loose those words out of your soul and say god i'm just going to leave that in your hands and whatever you decide to do about that but i'm not missing heaven i'm not going to be i'm not missing being with the god of heaven and earth i'm not going to miss being with my family who i know is already in heaven so i'm gonna i'm gonna forgive the words that i spoke and loose them from my soul and i'm gonna live my life knowing one day i will live with you and that other person is left to god but i will tell you what you will do when you get there you will hug them and you will say i'm so glad you made it because there's no darkness no fleshly man your flesh man's buried you get to heaven and all you have such gratitude and joy and life can you can see it pouring in and out of you the love of god and waves you're so consumed you can only love everybody in heaven so don't let that one that one situation that you find out they're going to have and you feel like they didn't deserve it but you didn't pay a price for their life i would caution you to not stay in that place because it will affect your very destiny he's not done with you on the earth you need to run your race filled with life and joy not filled with that yeah that i'm not i don't want to go i don't want to even be there you don't know what you're saying you're like the cross you don't know what you're saying okay whoever god says repented and he allows him to be there will will be in heaven i think probably what i think more there's so many possible uh scenarios that that i could represent in that what i'm thinking of is in my own family um loose it from your soul yeah well i'm not even talking about me i'm talking about people my sister literally feel that way yeah and she supposedly is or was saved i'm not in contact with her right now because she cut cut that off but she said that but there are millions and millions of such women who were molested yes i know who and i know and and they've said those things and you're saying when you go if you go you're going to hug that person and love that person right because you're not in your flesh number one yeah people can't separate and not saying you have to separate i'm saying when you get there and the way the whole atmosphere like around this earth there's all kinds of wicked beings out there but there's good ones too there's angels there's hosts everything is around you and and they inhabit this earth those things don't inhabit heaven there is no anger there's no uh there's no um i'm trying to remember now i'm trying to remember earth words uh you're not going to be um you're not going to carry a fence in heaven no there's no offense that's it there is no offense it doesn't exist you can't you can't have something in you if it doesn't exist so when you die in this body and your spirit man steps outside at that moment you're probably beginning to say stuff because you don't feel the same when you pass from this world when this body stops working and your spirit man steps out full with life and joy and celebration in the very presence of the living god you can't wait to see him there's not going to be other thoughts in your head their thoughts aren't going to be well what if i see them you don't even care because see you're thinking in your natural mind and in your flesh you're thinking things but but when that spirit man steps out of you that is filled with light and love of god because they're coming to take you home to heaven at that moment you will feel totally different it won't wait till you get to heaven you'll already go filled with joy and light and life you're being consumed by it and so i would say trust god no matter what you've said god forgive me i said things that weren't right just use a general forgive me i said things that weren't right i want to be with you i would totally say i want to be with you and what you said about the others he already knows himself if you received the blood of christ and you were upset or angry or maybe maybe you were tormented he understands that too but when your spirit man steps out of this body this received jesus christ you're filled with him you don't have even this you won't have the emotions of anger of offense they're not in you anymore they're not there so you don't you don't need this is what god would say you don't be concerned about that okay you run your race with him you accomplish what he has for you to do let him have that just give that to him okay because jesus christ is the restorer of our soul you don't want to go around the world with a damaged soul and think that you can help other people or even have ideas to invent and create if you create out of a dark soul it's going to be something not good if you created a soul filled with light and love of god it will be something that will be great for everybody fun for everybody or change life for people so i would say choose that you know put the other thing on the shelf and say god i'm going to let you handle that and you deal with me even if you say you deal with me he will get you to a place eventually where you will let him deal with that but don't let your future or your right now that you're living don't let that be ruined by stuff that people did to you in your past or even currently now god doesn't intend for you to live where you're being abused that's not what god does not like that at all if you're in an abusive situation i would totally say get in room by yourself and say i'm not receiving this accepting this i'm not tolerating this treatment anymore i'm trusting you god to get me out of this situation put me in a place where i can live my life and i'm going to trust you and believe in you and you would be shocked at how quickly things would start to change for you there's something you can do right now about even what's happening to you now if you belong to him that is his goal but you know you have not because you asked not yeah you know as we close out would you be willing to just pray for the people whatever god gives you maybe even along the lines of what you're just talking about right there some people oh definitely um father i just released your life yes and your presence into every person watching father who's been in any situation that was abusive whether it was the past whether it's present i come against all fear in them i strike down that fear in jesus name i command the host of heaven to go right now to every person that is watching right now you pull down strongholds of anger strongholds of abuse strongholds of fear of confusion of deception right now i break that off of everybody watching don't live a lie live the life of god gave you in jesus name i declare the anointing would destroy every yoke and you need to say i receive that right now let the life of god fill you and consume you with his plans with his love in jesus name and you declare that you will no longer serve anything but the living god he holds your life in his hand and you have not because you ask not you are right now asking jesus right now i want this resolved i want to be removed from this abusive situation i ask you to open the doors so i can live life and live it abundantly i receive that

but anyway we're having we're going to have ken kerr here in just a moment i don't know if there's any announcements um i don't see any uh tomorrow is amanda grace so she will be on same time same place uh eleven o'clock and without further ado then let's bring in kat kerr my friend kat how are you how's everybody good you know i was saying just when you sat down we both chose to wear teal today what did you say about teal it is heaven's number one color and a lot of people think you know well they know purple is royalty but you know i have that on too but literally uh it's one of the father's favorite colors is teal i told people that and the peacock feathers which i wear i used to wear a lot actually represent the living creatures in heaven they have purple around all those eyes if you if you can look at a peacock feather it's got purple it's got this deep deep blue it's got a little bit of teal this fine liner teal but teal is the number one band of the rainbow that comes from him really i know you remember in the book of revelations john said i saw a rainbow like unto it was like unto emerald because they didn't have the color teal they didn't know what to call it so he called it the closest he could so he said emerald so everybody puts emerald around god when they paint him you know or they want to depict him but it's actually his teal it's where that green and blue meat in the in the rainbow it kind of okay so he wasn't saying there's emeralds he was saying it's the color that an emerald would you say you need to catch all the key words when you read the scriptures like unto means similar to okay hey while i speaking of catching keywords this is not on my list to ask you but before i ask you about the thing about uh what i want to know is people are always asking what bible version do you like the best uh well which bible versions are you studying if there's anything other than king james i think you talk about the king james what what bible versions do you like well the king james version has always been my favorite a lot of people don't even want to read it anymore because they think it was illegitimate but you know it was the first version put out there actually it really was and i will say this for the king james um there's a couple things maybe they were a little bit concerned about saying that we were made like a we were made like unto god and that we were little gods i mean there's a lot of things that people don't understand revelation on so in the in the different translations they kind of changed it just a little bit but i love the king james they just put it out there that there's unicorns in heaven there are they are right about that one people there's unicorns in heaven it's mentioned i think eight or nine times in the king james version most of the other versions i know for sure psalms 29 psalms 92 it mentions the unicorn wow and at one point even talks about the strength of his unicorn it even says that but they call it a rhinoceros i mean if i was a unicorn i went like i wanted to call a rhino okay and they said they don't understand because this isn't heaven this is a shadow of heaven that we're living in right now on this earth he took a shadow of heaven and made the earth wow so yes heaven is a world that's why this is a world not a flat one by the way the holy spirit laughs every time i say not flat you know he was here when it was made right yeah so anyway i do really love the king james version most of my main scriptures are underlined in the king james version bible i also like of course the amplified bible which did funny scriptures i think uh really well um also like the everyday bible uh one of my very favorites that it probably is not in print right now if you can find one is the scofield bible it's got some of the best reference notes of any of the bible i've seen bibles that talks about i think it mentions in jeremiah uh where it talks about about the earth um being very very old that it's been remade it also talks about when god turned the light out on the earth when it was first made and then darkness was upon the face of the deep which means the first time he made it he lit it with his glory there was no sun or moon on the year on the earth when he made it the first time he just lit it with his glory and when satan started going around defiling it it even says in the scofield version it says that uh satan made it a wilderness which he did he began to attack god's uh the way he had made things and twist things and and when he was kicked out of heaven he landed on planet earth he was supposed to land in hell by the way uh i don't know how long he stayed there but i like the king james version or the new king james version um the everyday bible which i don't know if that's in print uh most of mine are older versions i think scofield is uh i think you can go to amazon because i think we ordered it last year when you said that we ordered a big old thick thing yeah yeah it's kind of got a tannish brown tone to some of the things but yeah it's still around you can get that so oh boy i would definitely get it for references especially yeah the scriptures it's really good you know i i've got the application that's got about nine bibles and i just go back and forth on my computer but um you know i i like almost every version there's some problems like i i like what um oh my gosh i can't pull up his name brian simmons i like his bible and i love some of his explanations but some of them they don't square with me because jesus was called the word and and brian's translators changed it to the living expression well the word was the word so i wanted it they actually still in the in heaven itself uh some of the hosts still call him the word yeah he called him the lord of course host or the word and when he has always been with god it clearly said that the word was was with god was god that was who jesus christ was uh it didn't change who he was his name was just added on to a little bit when he came to the earth and died for us but i think you should leave it the word that's the way to say it yeah and i want to be careful that i don't i'm not telling the people i that i don't like brian simmons work i love his work but every translation you ever get there's going to be something that sounded better poetically in the king james or it sounded better in the new american standard which is very popular people don't get one that's parts of the bible yeah some translations i don't have in front of me actually left whole scriptures out or even some books out and they keep saying they're not done with it but you know that's been 20 years and they haven't finished it um so there's a couple versions one day we'll probably maybe just have a have a or part of a show on all the different translations or something like might help people but definitely i still will will stick to the king james version for where they have shared truth about heaven they don't change what it says they don't kind of cover it up or try to overshadow things there are unicorns in heaven you can't change that nobody can and you'll find out when you get there anyway my uh spiritual father wade tater who's now with the lord he loved the king james and he would always quote proverbs now watch i'm not going to get it the the but it's the part where he says and he says this only works in the king james the other places changed it but he said i love those who love me and i will cause them to inherit substance other places uses a different word but he loved the substance and i wish all i wish before he had gone home i'd been able to get ask him one more time what do you mean you know because he will he would kept going over and over that and i've never forgotten it because you're going to inherit stuff and sometimes you know it's actually literal wealth but it's also everything that is that god has is substance i think he's also i think it also uh suggests spiritual um dominion authority a substance means it's a weight it's a weighty thing it also does mean well there's no way we can get away with that it talks about a lot of the bible we are supposed to have wealth it says he became poor that we might be rich that's the state of existence so and the only reason he was poor was he left heaven uh according to heaven you know earth is definitely not on their standards as far as wealth goes but there's a difference here on the earth that being being wealthy and being poor and we as the body of christ are supposed to be blessed beyond measure and if our soul prospers we cannot uh there's no way that you will ever evade being wealthy and being walking in divine health so i do love when we first got started and kind of got into questions here but uh anything current anything uh current events that you want to comment on before you go back into questions i think this last week and this coming week weeks he's talking to me more about the future the uh near future than anything else uh according to what god is saying justice has already been sent there's no way we can um there's no way that justice is not going to be done therefore he asked me to use my gavel justice is being served people just get a plate and dish it up because you're going to have it that's good that's good you know and and when you talk about justice you you are you talking about both in the secular community in the political committee and even in the church is god bringing justice even in the church or are you talking about the world i'm talking about justice anywhere evil has been showing its ugly face there is going to be justice done in the church because he said that he would go tweak the house of god if you want to put in holy spirit's words uh that no one's going to escape not being put or knowing that there's a certain path he wants us to be on and then that includes the way we live our lives but the main justice will be not just a political world but this world will be touched by the hand of god and the scales will tip very very heavily against all evil wickedness killing stealing cheating lying um trying to take away our destiny our own life now and even our destiny the enemy wants to steal our destiny the enemy our enemy is satan but all those that he uses and right now have run to his side into the darkness the light of god is going to be shown so brightly on them that none of them will escape coming to justice whether it's the business world the medical world uh the political world the educational wherever it's happening that the doors are going to be ripped wide off of that and everybody will will know what is being exposed evil will be exposed and god's presence is power and his plans will be revealed there's a difference in exposing and revealing exposing us for the wicked and those who have been evil revealing are the people of god who haven't stepped back and are going forward we're in acceleration right now we're not we're no longer waiting on it is here right now and acceleration is a platform we'll all be operating from for the next 50 years maybe a hundred years but definitely the next 50 years will be 50 years we're in acceleration for the next 50 years that's a lot of acceleration oh my goodness does the lord show you when you talk about the acceleration and in the future are there of course the spirit's going to be poured out more and more and more i get that and expect that but are there does the lord show you natural um medical cures that will become available do you see any of that when he takes you to the future yes absolutely i do cancer will not exist on the earth at one time there'll be no cancer anywhere uh the virus he's going to make like dust which tells me it will no longer be on the earth there'll be five major medical cures of things that will no longer exist when he says a cure he means it won't come back there's no way it will come back because of the glory that will begin to be poured out not just down the earth but from our own selves who've created glory for god oh wow there's a whole these are whole different revelations you're having me try to say in one sentence uh we don't just make glory create glory for god that's why we're here we create glory christ in you is the hope of glory that doesn't just mean people will see the glory or feel the glory that means we will carry it we will we will release it from ourself like in shockwaves when we go places and the impact it will have in the in the natural world will be phenomenal so i've been outside at night yelling a lot so i'll let you take a drink and i'm going to ask you the first question that's good though about the very very good about the glory okay so shirley's asking this question and i'm going to read a scripture that i i know she's basing on she didn't say the scripture but she wants to the scriptures hebrews 9 11 and uh 12 or something like that but christ came as a high priest of the good things to come with the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is not of this creation not with the blood of goats and calves but with his own blood he entered the most holy place once for all having obtained eternal redemption so her question i know is based on that scripture and it says will you please ask cat curry if jesus blood is still in heaven and can we see it and that begs the question did he literally bring his blood to the location called heaven and pour it out or was that it was that literal or was that symbolic that was literal okay the it was collected at the cross i mean collected at the cross uh i'm not talking about people yeah i talked about the unseen of beings that were with him the whole time he was on the cross it had to be collected it had to be poured out in heaven number one if you remember heaven had been got had gotten not defiled but the presence of evil had been there when um satan turned rogue and tried to take over and took one third of the angels with him to lies and deception and uh and took away part of what was god's the blood did cleanse our sins but also cleanse anything that had been imparted or left there it's not like god couldn't wave his hand and say i'm taking it all away but there was major reasons why the blood had to be poured out unless he literally went before the throne of god before his very face of god and poured out on the mercy seat i was taken to heaven taken back to heaven at that time and i literally saw him pouring out his blood on the mercy seat and these words would appear in the mercy seat that's a whole awesome experience that i caught up literally not dreaming wasn't a vision i was taken there standing slightly behind him i could see exactly what was appearing on the mercy seat and it was like hate murder uh homography um all kinds of defilement uh every wicked evil thing you could think of appeared on that mercy seat and the last word that appeared was death and one drop of his blood would hit that on the mercy seat and you'd hear it like it would totally it would totally be dissolved it wasn't like it was really like hidden or covered up it dissolved it like it never existed that is the price he paid for you every sin every sickness every disease appeared on that mercy seat and there was silence that time in heaven while that was going on really all the angels were on their faces on the throne room floor uh and the father was sitting on his throne watching all of this take place uh if you remember when he told mary you know i have to go to my father and your father he said that when he met her outside the tomb when she thought he was the gardener because he actually was standing in the flower beds uh that's how my whole encounter started i was caught up when i was baptized in fire and literally two angels grabbed me at the altar in my church and flew me back in time it was like i saw thousands of lights coming towards me and when we stopped i was outside the tomb of christ he was standing in the garden with his back to me i was staying like some near some near some trees somewhere i've been in that garden myself now i've been i've been at that team myself but amazing that i could see mary come out and ask she thought it was a gardener she was asking where did they take him you know where they took him but when when he said her name she knew who it was he had glory coming out of him and he said i have to go to my father and your father well the reason he had to go was the angels were waiting with these this urn of blood that they had taken from the cross and i got to follow them i followed them all the way up through the heavenlies it was not my first time doing that i followed them all the way up into the heavenlies into the throne room uh they all were by the millions waiting outside but the minute he stepped in the throne room everybody went on their face all of the host the seraphim everybody was on their face in the throne because here comes the lord of glory and with these with these signs of his sacrifice and then the angel followed him up there and handed him this urn i think there's a picture of it in my first book actually i think there's a picture of that scene where he's pouring it out on the mercy seat he destroyed once and forever the bible says a sin sickness and disease he destroyed it with his sacrifice but you have to receive it you have to repent i'm just add this in there for free holy spirit said you have to repent for your sins and ask him to forgive you receive jesus christ as your savior that blood that he applied right there on that day on the mercy seat was for you so that you could freely enter into heaven when you left this world you could be called his and his alone while you lived on the earth there's so many things you get from becoming a believer many people don't understand even the mystery of that a beautiful thing but he literally did prompt that blood on the mercy seat and it's still there and yes yes you can see it is still there okay is it like the the when you say it's there do you mean the cup the urn is there do you mean you can see the blood on them what what do you mean it's still there i mean you can see the blood okay the blood did not dissolve the blood dissolved the evil the all the perversions that was dissolved but the evidence of his blood besides the holes in his wrist yeah and the marks in his head uh that blood is evidence it's evidence wow and is this because i don't remember that picture i can't remember is it an urn is it like how big yeah maybe maybe you could show the picture i will find i'll find the picture yeah that would be awesome to know and then um while you're looking for that i wonder when you did he pour drops a drop at a time on individual sins or did they all appear and he poured it out and they all you know what i mean or did you 100 times one at a time there's no time in heaven so to me yeah it's hard it's really hard to understand yeah to me i knew i was there i knew that i saw all that but there was no minutes going by there's no time in heaven they don't have they may have one clock in heaven but it doesn't have like minutes it doesn't have like one video it doesn't have one to twelve on it it has events on it yeah if i could find it and see which one was that the first one or the second one jen what's in the first it should be the first one i think you could go get me the calendar okay i actually put it in one of our calendars oh awesome i will find it i kind of have this big recollection of seeing that but yeah i can't that's just fascinating and one at a time so i didn't look at page numbers people i don't know nothing on the p i know what was written on there i just don't remember the page numbers that were made for it uh but it actually he actually here it is i got it it's not in color because my books were not made in color at the time you know i didn't have a lot of money people uh we are going to do a version after i do the third book we're going to do a um a special not limited edition i'll never do a limited edition um it will be a special edition and you will have all three books together in full color all the illustrations will be done in color so whenever that finally happens so here it is right here can you see it yeah go a little closer because some of them have to do the father's in the middle at the top of the throne and there's christ pouring it out of the urn on the mercy seat yeah yeah yeah this is christ right here by my right here and there and if i'm seeing correctly is not it's not very big i can't it's not very big the urn is not that large right it's it looks like a small it's well you know it's bigger than his head it's it's it probably was maybe i don't know maybe two feet oh here we go this is much better how about this one oh okay there you go can you see it yeah so the wing you can see the wing with the eyes in it over here right here that is one of the living creatures um standing um near him and that is christ holding the urn that is carrying his blood wow and you can see there's like a list down there you see that oh and the list is true is that this put across the mercy seat is that what i'm yes it was it appeared there okay on the mercy seat and he would pour on every single that i left it running out of there so you could see that it actually was blood uh but it actually came out like a drop at a time and hit every single one and the list kept coming standing there that list kept coming and um and so that's actually the scene i saw and then i sketched it and gave it to my artist and he made it but yeah i'm guessing there must have been hundreds of different things that there were there were um of course i'm sure that some diseases were i think it may have said disease any disease and so but this is the wing of the living creature with the eyes in it and they're they're pretty tall this way is this is a gem like here so this is actually in my book because um on heaven because the father wanted everybody to see the scene his son literally came poured his blood out that's a representation of the mercy seat it was a little bit bigger than that but we couldn't get it on the book page so give you an example that there was a structure there the seraphim were there on either side of him and i know they talk about you know they talk about the one that they had on the earth down here that dave and all his men would carry around um in heaven it's alive i have to say that even what what's alive um the actual mercy seat you know the one they brought into the temple where they would put the blood they would sprinkle the blood on you right right not the same one you're seeing in the picture that's not the same one that's in heaven actually um the one in heaven have a living it's there but it's got real angels they're not golden angels with their wings over the mercy seat so again uh what's on earth is a shadow of what's there so the instructions from the father to make that um the ark of the covenant thank you holy spirit thank you for telling me what they called it what they called the ark of the covenant that they made they took in the tent of meeting and then later into the temple uh where they would sprinkle it was in the holy of holies where that was they would sprinkle the blood of the sacrifices on that in the temple and that's how they used to cleanse like once excuse me once a year they would um they would do that to cleanse the sins of the people for that year and then they did it again a year later well we know that's why they said christ paid a price once and for all yeah that they didn't have to do the animal sacrifice anymore because christ paid the price once and for all and but he literally did sprinkle his blood on that mercy seat that's a pretty amazing cat that's going to destroy destroy the effects of sin and disease and hate and all these other things defilement i mean we're all on there and he's literally pouring human blood if i can you know because you're thinking of this blood he'd shed at the cross yeah i know but i mean he was human what i'm saying is he his mother's through his mother's side his humanity was there in other words it was it wasn't some spiritual blood it was the real deal it was the real blood yeah and when you went back and uh god took you back in time i'm guessing taking a number of other people back in time too you're s are you saying because god is outside of time he can insert you into that moment of time that is for you happening before your eyes it's not a replay it's not i'm going to show you what it's like and it's going to feel like yeah i'm literally in that moment of time when anything happened he showed me it was reality i tell people god does not work with me with um dreams at all every now and then he'll show me a vision but most of the time it's like i guess real life uh encounter is the only way i can say it i was literally there at the time it happened and he'd have to take me back in time but you know he actually did do that when he hid um uh not abraham he hid moses in the cleft of the rock and he showed him the hinder parts that doesn't mean his back he showed him the back past times he showed him the times that had passed on earth that's what that scripture that's revelation on that scripture which makes you fully understand that moses was such a friend of god and that's why he got he got upset when anybody spoke against moses or made fun of what he said he literally took moses he hid him inside of himself and took him back in time so he could see how the earth was made he saw adam and eve in the garden i mean how could he write the books yeah write those books if he had not seen them he could not have written them and so that's why he said that i will show you the hinder parts or the parts behind you yeah and when when moses appeared on the mount of transfiguration um was this the moses that's that was in heaven that was put there or was this moses in the cleft of the rock that was transported in the future or do you know that was the moses who when they when he took me and showed me that he was a living he was on the earth it was when that happened okay so he was taking control when it's happening it's when the situation god is god isn't just over time it comes from him he didn't appear in time time comes from him okay so that's why he's the only one people the father is the only one who knows when his son will return to do the rapture thing not even jesus knows when that will happen and that's in the father's hands because time comes from him he has his own timeline in the throne room and he he he counts time by events he taught me that a long time ago i don't count by man's monthly stuff or man's time clock because there isn't time so how could he count it by time i know he mentions time in the bible or man wouldn't understand it but the father literally counts time by events and on the timeline are events and we are a long way from the tribulation the perilous times and the rapture that is not what you're seeing right now he's not going to miss the best times on the earth with us being manifested sons and daughters walking the power and the glory that's part of christ's reward yeah what he paid for to see us operate like that uh he's not going to let jesus miss seeing all and i want to i want to point out that robin your personal friends with robin and his wife robin and robin and being you guys the men have gone fishing and the women have gone shopping and all that but robin robin is one that speaks more of the imminent return and the eminent rapture but robin agrees with you a hundred percent this is not that time yeah i don't know where how far ahead he thinks it is but he said this is not that time that's why what you're seeing and what johnny anno came forward the other day and it was was seeing the celebration in heaven and and eating of uh was it cookies it was eating cookies you didn't see it because you don't tend to watch the broadcasts but god took him and showed him that they were preparing cookies in heaven they were seeing the russian ukraine debacle and all that stuff that's going on and while they were seeing that they were preparing cookies because the the the solution had already been decided in heaven that's right that's why the father talks to me so much about the future uh i tell people i'm from the future guess what so are you if you were in him before the earth was made and he went to he saw the end from the beginning in the beginning from the end you lived in him when we were taken there so you're from the future too yeah yeah that's crazy um i want to ask you a sort of an off the wall question when because of that outside of time thing has that changed now you know i know you do i know you're a prayer and a decree but you you you tend to do the decrees probably primarily because i think you said that is prayer but has being outside of time changed the way you pray the way because you you see god in a different understanding so when your prayers because some people think and do and absolutely fast and pray and i know you fast certain foods so they fast and fast and fast to accomplish what god wants to do god seems to do the celebration i have a commission yeah i i i couldn't have changed my life or the way i i i always lived for god i always did i got born again age four and when i received christ because i'm a seer i saw him step inside of me no man and i tried telling people they laughed you know in the church they laughed at me and they thought i had a great imagination i went no actually uh it really did happen then i stopped telling people but i i have seen christ so many times i stopped counting that too and the thing is this i know that moses had a similar relationship enoch his relationship probably way surpassed the one i had so much to the point that god loved being with him that he took him to heaven okay well on my side he won't let me live in heaven the father said i'm not letting letting you die you're staying on the earth as long as i want you there and i said okay that's fine with me so one thing i don't ever think about is death i mean to me death and life are the same if it concerns heaven if you're leaving for heaven most of the time you don't take this body with you it's your spirit man that looks just like you is what goes to heaven one day you'll get this body back don't cry some people don't want it back but you're going to get it back but you'll be young you'll be filled with life okay and it'll be a powerful i do think about the day the dead in christ shall be raised and all the graves explode open and the urns with all the ashes in it come the whirlwind comes spinning out of that and i think it'll be one of the most exciting days on earth when that when that actually happens but i can just say god gave me a commission and i had already sought christ for many many years to know him more i i had set myself with that that i'm going to find him uh i knew of him but i want to find him to know him and one day he did walk into the wall of my home this was with christ and from that time he just does it when he feels like it and then the problem started doing the same thing but the father always had more of my commission or a change in my commission of what i would how i would operate for this next season which could be 10 years 50 years whatever and he would show me in great detail so i would fully understand and not think i could go off and and you know make a decision i never really tried to make decisions i've always been a powerful intercessor and i did pray i didn't do the five and six hour prayers on my face i already seen christ i knew he was real i didn't have to try to make his presence come to me but i've always been loud even to my siblings you know my loud voice comes from standing out and calling them home to eat dinner when they were five blocks away i think god was building up my voice to be strong i was the person who never wanted to be seen by anybody you're known i didn't need anybody's validation because i moved twice so well even way way back 30 40 years ago i did and i do declare and decree because the as the lord said i want you to start decreeing he probably said that like i don't know 30 years ago start decreeing into clearing because it will be established unto you so from that point and he said it's still prayer and this is what the father always says to me prayer is conversation with a father son and holy spirit no matter who you're praying you know or mentioning in your prayer you're having conversation my conversation did change because i pray all the time because i'm speaking with them all the time you never pray i went i never stopped praying okay that's him declaring decreeing and then i started making rulings as a king a spiritual king on the earth he told me how to make rulings over the darkness and it had to listen there's another whole level coming people you need to know what it is to be a spiritual king or priest or lord unto your god but if you have a weak christian life you may not ever hear him saying something to you he was very adamant about what was required to give my life to them it's in the bible lay down your life and find it in him so i'm still being very scriptural i just happen to believe that and by it and and kat you've said a couple of times on this show that at some point i don't know if there was a moment in time but over time at least you got delivered from fear i don't know if you had much before but you got delivered from it and is it true do i understand right that when you pray and when you live you don't fear anything is have i heard that right you're not afraid of anything yeah there's no fear in me how could they be fearing me if i have seen them face to face and what they have told me is true uh and he will perform all the words that he spoke if he spoke words to you he still has every purpose and desire and plan to perform those words maybe not in your time frame i've learned that god uh of course is over time and people think a lot of times i'm late sometimes he makes me do it on purpose he does huh because i live by him i live by him and god said sometimes men may have to change their timeline that is true though no they don't they they've gotten church service down to an hour maybe and i have seen days when people will spend the night at the church because the glory cloud will be there it'll be hard to make the people leave people get over it that your pastor wants to have a two-hour meeting every now and then but when the glory begins to roll in you won't want to be a away from that or apart from that so it's getting longer it's not going to be shortened and as you know that profits do show up on god's exact timing it's still going to be okay people well i love the fact that you have no fear because you and i i i used to have all kinds of fears the more i get to know the lord the more even this thing when i say uh even when i when i used to fear i used to fear cancer but when i started to learn about heaven yes those things started going away because i thought okay well the worst thing that could happen is i could get cancer and then i could die then what well then i get to go to heaven and it's like well that would be a short suffering compared to the glory that's about to show up so i i don't have that it doesn't mean i don't i i don't i'm not where you are by by miles and miles but i i can attest the fact that fear begins to go away the more you know the lord so yeah it is the enemy's number one weapon and most of the time he doesn't have to do anything to prove that fear is called unfounded fear and enemy loves to use that if he can just he'll go and do a thought on you or put thoughts in your mind about these horrible things happen to you just turn like satan's like there and say you're a liar i'm not going to listen to you and you'll freak him out if you say if you answer if he tries to put fear on you you need to say something in retaliation like i serve the living god and only the living god i don't serve you so get out now when you say those words trust me he'll flee he will flee from you and and any demons persecuting you unless you're out there sinning and maybe you call them but if you're not you have the right to say you're not tolerating them and you're in your presence or around you i don't tolerate any of them it helps me that i see them or even them trying to come they they try to come like way around me but they can't hide okay i can tell you people you get to the place where when you begin to operate an extreme discernment and you actually will know the thoughts and intents of people's hearts you're standing next to it helps it a lot when you're going to minister to them or share god i say i just share god and the last three people i have shared with in random places at random times like 2 a.m if i'm out with sometimes i'm out with my husband uh and we're getting milk somewhere because we ran out of milk i got to have my hot chocolate people it's my source it's my number one thing i drink is my hot chocolate i only eat once a day so you know hot chocolate's important so if he's out with me because i have to explain why i was out at 2 a.m yeah there will be a divine appointment with somebody and there was someone who was suffering having been on drugs for years and his wife had just and uh he was a set up by god and that guy left changed from that well gas station because i was there at the appointed time and didn't argue with god about going uh and so this happened in the most random places recently but every one of them was a non-believer wow wildcat that's amazing well okay we have some more questions and i said i would get this this week so becky and shelly and they're both elementary school teachers this is their question can i or can we pray over our students as a watcher and those watcher over those kids and rebuke and remove things from them like the way you explain for parents what is your advice on that authority for the students in my care what else can i do and say over my students besides speaking healing and exponential growth in body soul and spirit and declare their salvation now we don't know if this is a public school or private school but it doesn't matter and i'm not saying to have a prayer line because you'd really get in trouble uh you know there's so many things that you can do to take authority over things and of course you do have authority you have authority given to you by the city by the state by the parents that you've allowed your their children to be under your care so if they're under your care you totally have the right to speak over them uh in the spirit about things in their lives for sure you absolutely do and a parent has the greatest level of authority to speak but if if kids parents aren't born again i would say the next person in that that family let's say you're an aunt or an uncle to somebody and the parents of these children who you're related to uh don't even know christ or don't care you could actually speak on their behalf as a watcher over their soul in that level but as a teacher you absolutely were given uh care and that is your designated position you do you can say as one of the watchers over their soul i come against any evil wickedness going on in their home i'm not saying line the kid up and say i'm saying just say it you can say in the classroom before it starts or you can say in your home before you leave you absolutely should be saying something like that i take authority over satan's plans of attacks to use or abuse these children under my care and i command the host of heaven to be posted around the school while i am there with them and to go home when one of them go home with each one of them to watch over them to break up and crush the planes of darkness against them when we begin to do this in the body of christ you will see major changes happening everywhere which is one of the purposes of spirit force that i'll be teaching the first time in north carolina um but i actually think i'm going to be probably doing wherever i go to speak this year i may say one meeting in order to expedite at one meeting everywhere i go do you do spirit force in that one meeting so much more people can be a part of it i will be doing it online so don't don't be concerned that you're gonna miss it the hunger you have is what excites me but you will be learning to do stuff like i just explained and let me tell you this world is going to experience a shift because we will be taking our place that christ appointed us to have authority in this earth over all darkness not some of it but anything that runs in the category of kill steal or destroy we have authority over that and you're going to learn how to take authority over that and how to crush the plans of the enemy so good so good um and i'm gonna just say illumination has a question for me but i don't see it illumination type it in the private chat and i'm gonna ask cat this other one um i'm gonna skip this one because i want to get to this other one uh this person is kind of like what we're talking about the blood but this person says is there a museum in heaven that houses all the things like tablets of the the ten commandments tablets or the ark of i guess they mean the earthly ark of the covenant but i don't know why you'd want to see that if you had the real one that was me noah's ark aaron's rod the king's crowns are there is there some such thing as a museum of those things in heaven yeah i think it's probably in the hall of heroes that they show a lot of the things that were used by these great men and women of god people absolutely would want to and i can tell you if it's on the earth it was made from one that symbolizes that and in heaven so those things although they were on the earth the original original that god designed for his own purposes would be in heaven and yes you do get to see things you can see noah's ark in heaven you probably can write on it oh awesome yeah that'll be kind of cool um okay now i hear she's typed this question for me i haven't pre read it but it says cat can you talk about glory clouds i've been getting more and more of a holy spirit's presence and got a very brief open vision of what i feel like might be a glory cloud right over my head while i was in bed i saw pink mixed with white and i felt like it was the holy spirit so you want to comment on that you literally can see with your human eyes the glory cloud and i i think a morning star uh one i can't remember which one of them they used to come to new life where that was my church when i have time to go new life christian fellowship in jacksonville florida before they had their big place up in north carolina um morningstar would come to our church that held 5 000 people and have their big meetings they would last 10 days and i'm telling you sometimes they played uh 24 hours a day their worship was so phenomenal at one point the glory cloud appeared on stage you you literally could see the glory cloud to me it looks like um it's like sort of i can't it's really hard to say but it doesn't look like just a cloud in the sky like she saw the pink and the white mixing it's got many colors in it because it does also represent the throne which has the the living rainbow there and so to me it's like these little pieces that continually turn in this cloud so minuscule if you weren't aware you wouldn't necessarily see each individual on making up the cloud but there's all kinds of colors in that cloud and it appeared over the drum set on stage and i know i think it was was it susie jen uh who was part of morningstar's worship she dove while she was on the stage dope into the cloud oh really it was one of the most powerful meanings they had it was during one of their times when they were here creating a new worship cd uh but it literally manifested on the stage i i've seen many versions of the glory cloud or sizes of the glory cloud but at one point on this earth which is why we're not going anywhere uh at one point there will be angels holding open the door of the sanctuary and when you go in the glory cloud will already be there okay this is on the earth and this earth that we're standing on right now the glory car will be there i was taken forward in time and i saw this uh i also saw some armed gunmen trying to go in there to they were going to take everybody out in there and god said he actually said watch what happens i was forward in time and when they grabbed the handles they had these massive guns they were going to go in and to shoot everybody their hands froze to the doors and begin to melt oh my goodness really i mean the guns they were holding these huge guns began to melt to these these were going to murder them these terrorist bodies they began to melt to their bodies their hands were melting that they were screaming so loud uh when the rescue and the police came they didn't they cut the door down they had to haul them all off all and all together just to remove them and god said i will protect my beloved and at one point it will be very dangerous to come against anybody he's following me believing in me or allowing my presence to manifest so i'm telling you we're entering into these powerful days i'm at really powerful days god said in the past you died to bring me glory but in these days you will live and live and live to bring me glory so if you're alive right now you're appointed under special things and to be great for god yeah yeah one day i'll tell the story i won't do it today but i mean there are people that are not on this earth anymore who came against me i'm talking about 30 40 years ago and i was following christ and i would our our spiritual life was alive we had a lot of a long way to go to grow to where we are now but god removed some people from this earth and i had forgotten about it and because he had done something special for me and i said god i can't even believe you did that and he said i've been doing that for you for years and he began to highlight the people that suddenly are down there oh man if that's what happened when the glory was just small 40 years ago what are we all about to see and i didn't know that he took me inside another sanctuary and they actually had a sign right in their foyer when you came into this one church it said enter in do not enter in unworthy or you may not come out you may be dropped this is something that will really literally happen he shows me the reality of truth i don't have um i don't have just uh maybe something that represents symbolic he doesn't show me things symbolically he shows me literally what is real what really will happen you have to remember he gives me the mind of an eight-year-old so it has to be something an eight-year-old could share really understand this is what will happen and so there will be a whole new all which is probably lacking in many sanctuaries will be such an awe over the name of god his person i mean father son and holy spirit the triune godhead that we set you all because of the powerful manifestations that will be happening in the earth people will run make sure you get their sunday and get your little special seat because you may not have one one day when the world begins to show up well and that's and you're describing too you know ananias and sapphira was a one-time event as far as we know but those days are coming back in in mass aren't they in mass they are coming in mass because of the amount of revelation people will have in the earth that they fully understand or have been shown this is who he is he really is who he says he is and do not mock him do not dumb don't don't uh don't speak wicked evil things over him or what he's planning he won't randomly just kill anybody he's not going to do that but those who have an evil heart who lied to him on purpose or lying in front of other people they may have a really hard time convincing him not to take them out yeah and you know johnny you know this is not your you're called to different ministries but johnny has and several of them had said we're coming into a time of great great great exposure even in the church amanda talks about the amanda grace um but usually there they don't take it beyond exposure exposure exposure but if ananias and sapphira days are returning it might be exposure slash death to some people that have resisted his calling i mean is that are you seeing that kind of thing then i am i'm not saying in every single sanctuary it'll happen but it will happen in different places and it is because of what is god bringing to the earth that's never been here before to walk in levels of authority and dominion that he's giving to us uh because we're supposed to we're actually they were given this by christ but the revelation of how to operate and all of that that you will speak to the land the sea and the air with his anointing and knowing his purposes and plans and you walk in his ways he'll tell you to speak to something and it's going to happen and it will be known that you did that but they'll know who's got who what god that you serve that you did who's name days these are powerful days and i'm not saying that in a small way and that's why he had to show you all evil where it was the wickedness and the evil what hell's plans were using man because you know the devil's always done that but this time it's going to fail it's going to fail yeah it will be totally bad okay that's good that's good i i was supposed to say too that that person asked that question about uh the glory cloud that they saw they wondered if it was a glory cloud uh there that was green lantern in 345 i don't have a name um illumination centered in but when she said i was in that bed and i saw these did you say that was the glory or those that was the holy spirit do you do you sense what she was seeing i think it probably was a part of the glory or some of the glory because the glory cloud of god well the glory is known by light okay the fire is known by fire baptism and fire you will see fire you will experience fire i have had a measure of baptism and fire it was all about fire and it came into me like a blow torch literally wiped everything off the walls of my soul anything that maybe i saw or heard that wasn't my choice uh it wiped all of it off and it made me even bolder than i am now when that happens so when the full measure comes you're not going to walk away the same just like the people in the book of acts they got they got holy spirit and they got baptism in fire and that's what it does to you it makes you bold if you were never bowed before they didn't care who saw them if they heard them speaking about god that's what's going to happen when that begins to happen so that's the fire the glory is a totally different thing it's still a part of the image of christ the image of the father and even holy spirit will will come in bands or a whirlwind to fire himself so these are things coming from the throne the glory the fire the power is uh if you realize even what you say when you talk to them uh honor our glory of power you don't even realize you're saying things that exist in heaven that are something that have substance something of the substance that that he was talking about when he said that i'll bring you the substance of god yeah oh that's good yeah that's by the way that that's helpful to get that um clarification of the substance so um i just want to let's see um let's we have time for one more maybe a second it says i've heard cat say several times that there are body parts in heaven my question is how do we pray for these body parts to be given um to our loved ones and ourselves that need them and i'm going to add a question to that at the same time so we just i'm going to throw in mine with that and that is are these but if there's a right arm is that right arm for steve one day that's going to need it or is that right arm for anyone that's going to need a right arm how does that work and how do you pray for um i think that whatever body parts you are lacking or that aren't working properly i have seen i i didn't know that arms were designated for certain people however i was in a service where an angel came down with a gift box and walked through a man who was due for heart surgery he walked in that man's body and left a new heart in that man's body that was a service we had at new life christian fellowship where they had like three hours of worship and at the minute after the three hours of worship there was this big crack and the staircase literally came down from heaven into the uh the sanctuary and angels began to run down with all these boxes uh because at the point i heard this loud crack nobody else heard the crack but me um they always had me sitting on the front row with a sketch pad so i could sketch anything i was seeing in the spirit run that's a really awesome journal sketch pad i have but they and then our pastor said shout out what you need from jesus right now right now we've seeded the heavenlies with our worship with our decorations right now yell out what you want and this man yelled out i want a new heart and the angels begin running down with all these gift boxes so your body part comes in the gift box people wow right through you with it and it's put right in the place it needs to be it will be just the size you need to match the rest of your body i know that part i know that happens and this man uh gave a testimony in the past said tomorrow night we're having like a a long testimony service and the man actually went to the doctor who had just scanned his heart and they scheduled him for the surgery looked at him and said where did you get the new heart you you couldn't this could not have happened i saw your heart we've got we've got mris and x-rays and no you don't have this heart in you and the guy greenlee said i got last night in the church service well that's fine that is that so so that's cool so you they seated they seated uh heaven with their praise and worship and god basically said i can't help myself anymore i'm going to send healing is it kind of i don't know what what guides the bowls were full or however god saw there were thousands of people in those services okay for that one purpose to reach god to to just to love god to reach him to manifest their love for him and gratefulness for him and there wasn't like continual prayer asking through the whole service they were just worshiping him with abandon that they loved him and they they were blessing him and then when the pastor said stand up now when he said that i saw jesus standing behind him which is all in my my my thing i drew i gave it to the pastor later but jesus appeared and then then the pastor who didn't see him because he was behind him stood up and yelled uh jesus is here yell to him and tell him what you need and people were like i want my divorce decree cancelled i need a new car i need a new house i need this they were yelling out and those people got the things that they cried out for so i can tell you god has different reasons and purposes why he sends them i absolutely do know this at some time in the future they will empty this is how great it's going to be people so this we're not anywhere near the end we're at the beginning of the great great great days on the earth and i just know a hundred and some years into the future i'm quite sure all this will be going on and uh but there'll be a point in that time when the empty the body parts warehouse because nobody will need body parts after this time of glory on the earth i also can just sew this in for free i do know the antichrist will not be able to appear until we who walk in the glory who love jesus christ that bride he's waiting for with no sin and no flesh around us operating in the earth as as just the humans we are with the glory uh the antichrist will not be able to appear until we're taken out because the earth won't need him when the enterprise comes they'll be broken burn up they'll be desperate uh for someone to come and help them that's not going to happen because jesus christ who is who is the king of kings and lord of lords will be so manifest by our lives in the earth that there won't be a need for the antichrist at that time so that's a long ways away people don't plan to get on your rapture rug and get out of here i tell people get your crown on but i can just say this god does have a plan and whether you understand what's been going on full exposure has to happen in order to clean that platform and put on there who god wants for us to operate uh without any con you know anyone coming against us or abusing us as believers in this earth so that's the days we're going in and on that to kind of wrap up that this last this show and the clarification on that question that she wanted to know well how do i pray for body parts for my loved ones and you actually may be given the clue but you said they worship for three hours and no you don't have no worship it's it's more of a declaration a decree and god said that whatever you do to declare decree it shall doesn't say maybe it shall be established unto you and i i i do that a lot that's that is my prayer life and i'll just present it before the lord say father come before your son and i present this before you that i declare and decree that this this thing that's been happening to this person this will stop in jesus name that you will give them justice that they you will fulfill what they need i just did that the other day when one of my family members who actually helped me to pay for my first book he helped he bought he paid for my first book to be published or i would not have had it and i have i stood in the gaffering because he was really not in a good way and overnight it changed wow so you got to go home the next day so you declare in the creeks so and even this person without his years on the years of me blessed be on measure because of what he had done for me it's like bringing god into remembrance he says bring me into remembrance you know especially if it's people who've done things for you or whom you love or who have been servants or helped you can actually say that i know they can say it's going before the courtrooms of heaven i just go straight to the throne standing in the gap for this person i gave his name i said i'm reminding you this is what he has done on my behalf and so many others that's really good and so i'm standing in the gap you said to bring in to remember so i am so i'm asking you uh to bless me to let him live and not die let him rapid rapid re restoration his body and then he'll be able to leave and he won't die in the hospital somewhere he'll be fulfilled to see the glory and the blessings you have for him in this earth and the next day he was all right that's crazy well yeah and that you said yourself father is staying in the gap for let's just say my sister you know her arm is damaged or it's not working right i stand in the gap for her you put me in her in our family to love to be a part of so i'm standing in the gap that she will her arm will be restored or you'll give her a brand new one however you desire to do that i thank you for doing that in jesus name amen that's a declaration that he will establish unto you i can't say it'll happen overnight i'm just saying those words you just spoke will be re received in heaven god will not ignore those words he will write it down and what happens is whenever whenever it is whatever it is his choice or time that requisition you just gave will go to the body parts warehouse it will be sent to the back they'll take that arm put it in a gift box and i know you're thinking you're pitching a human arm it's just flopping around you know a spiritual arm at that point right in the spirit but you can see it and they would deliver it walk through your sister's body if this was the plan and then she would have it immediately and i've heard of testimonies way back in the days right when people before people got new feet they got new legs and some of the revivals that were happening back then we're about to see major major divine healings and let me tell you if you say that you want it whole there's a difference in whole and healed by the way like the lepers who were healed and went away with missing body parts but healed the one came back to guess what thank him and he was made whole like it never happened in other words any body parts that were missing they were put back on him because of his gratefulness for the healing so always declare you want them made whole i always say i want to make whole i want them made whole like it never happened like it never was it's your level of faith because things are done by faith you're showing your faith to god when you do that that's so good yeah and i was thinking even before the cross the jewish people who may not have ever followed him but they said this centurion i think it was he built our synagogue and that's how we want you to help him because he built our synagogue that's all jesus needed was their gratitude for someone to give him permission or whatever you would say encouragement he doesn't he he he really responds to gratitude didn't he you know he really does he does respond to gratitude and i remember probably like 20 years ago the lord came in and talked to me and said um it would bless us if our people were more they were grateful he said gratitude is sorely missing in the body of christ and to to thank god to thank his son for sacrifice but thank god for that you're alive he's given you this life in the earth at this time to do things for him but also to walk in love to show people his character uh he put us here for a reason but how wonderful i know you celebrate people's birthdays and you know anniversaries and stuff how about just celebrating the fact that they gave you life and chose to bring you here to to carry the glory for for them and to be here for them i i bought a plaque that said be grateful every day and i actually put it on my wall and i thank him for almost everything that comes into my life i think just that alone would will definitely draw the eyes of god to you that's interesting yeah that's good yeah and this year too i've discovered that i've been doing you know i live on 20 acres he lived here for 22 years old farmhouse you've been here one time yes but you know i was thanking him this morning i said you know what lord i this has never gotten old i have never stopped loving this property but i don't tell him that all the time but i said i'm you know sorry for not telling you every day but this is i'm so grateful you know in 20 acres there's a lot of corners to this property or places that i haven't even been to it's 20 acres is pretty large yeah it's i haven't even begun to explore the possibilities in this property in 22 years so anyway i'm very very grateful and i i you know i sense his smile i don't yeah i didn't you know i didn't feel anything at that moment but i sensed his smile and i'm doing that i know it pleases him when we do that i guarantee you you're going to please the heart of god uh i know we want to bless like i spoke earlier you want to bless people that you love and help people you don't know which also blesses the heart of god but even letting him know that you're thankful you're like well he can see me yes but words mean so much to him i mean he wrote wrote up the tablets of stone he had the word of god written words are important god always writes things down in journals and and all kinds of books himself so i think um sometimes i would tell people just write a card to him oh nice that's that's good just write a card somewhere in your house and say god i want you to read this card it tells you how much i feel about you i'm telling you he'll be down there getting pictures of that card that's good that's really good wow that's that's a good practical thing that's that's more than a prophetic act that's an act that's it yeah well cat uh i guess that's their time tell people what they can get at your two websites and um revealing heavens on the screen revealing heaven.com yeah revealingheaven.com is where we have our our events which were finally hopefully we've been so busy packing a lot of other things we've been just kind of waiting to get done but we are definitely still in transition to move from here into actual home the offices will be here for a while but we are already looking for an office building then our studio will be here for a while so we'll still be here in and out of this place for some time but um revealingheaven.com is where you find out the events it's where you buy stuff on our store and i always show the cup this cup that i love i don't do demons you know that was the holy spirit's quote with the lightning bolt and we actually have some kids cups i'm just going to show it it's a winter scene from heaven in here uh those are cute we still have some of those left if you're interested but god wants us to flood the marketplace with heaven and it's only beginning uh with the things he's gonna have us do about that and my other website is catker.com it's the only place in the whole world that you could give to me online if you don't like sending things to the mail believe it or not we still get a lot of mail and i'm grateful for people and i know that you are so grateful for the people who support you i know people the the salvation is free but anything you do in the work of god it is going to cost you money because you will need supplies you'll need a building you'll need staff to do things even pastors and churches i know people say well they shouldn't have charged for me to come and get the the gospel is free but they have staff they have to pay they have no they to have the church there's maintenance that has to be done i mean i i know those things exist so that so be grateful to god when you go someplace give something in the offering to help them to do more and of course always bless those that you're receiving from i always uh put in a plug for steve because steve has uh a job from heaven he has a commission from heaven to give a platform for the true prophet of god to speak or the true prophetic to speak of god's behalf so steve is important if you want to bless god bless steve i'll just say that very kind and i'm very grateful for everything people give to me but just hang on because it's going to get wilder and wilder on the good side on the god side and you'll be some of the the people who have such a story to tell in the future of the greatness of god and what he did for our nation and for this world and that the way they will live their life is changing but the evil and the wickedness will be diminished crushed down pushed back or just go to prison that's good yeah cat we love you very much we and your staff say hi to jen she always greets us in the morning on wednesday and i know you have other staff there we are going to say hello how many people are in there well right now i have one two three four five six wow okay so i always think there's like two or three of you but it's yeah we it's growing it is we love that yeah i was telling people yesterday we counted and there were a couple that are starting right about now there's two uh young women that are starting in different states but that that comes up to 24 people that are just working on a larger stream so yeah and that's well said we i didn't know you're going to do that but yeah every two weeks we do it we do a payroll we got it it's only right to pay people for their work for us so we thank you so much pay our people too yeah yeah so we we really appreciate those that give and do support cat very strongly she is one of our favorites and you are basically i mean we were existed before but this thing got launched in

hello welcome to catker day it's wednesday march 23 2022 yet we've named it cat cur day and uh it's gonna be great uh dealing with questions about heaven for any of you who are new and don't know about that cat's had many thousands of trips to heaven that's one of the gifts she has it happens all the time so we're going to ask her about anything she might have to say about current events and then we'll go into more questions but put your questions uh either put it in reply or go to the comments underneath youtube or on facebook we kind of try and audit those and get the most common questions that people are asking we don't repeat a lot of them questions that have already been answered but we do repeat some if you go to the clip channel at our channels tab from youtube you will find um 50 60. i don't know how many there's a lot of a lot of episodes and there's lots and lots of clips where we say the question what the question is that cat answers and then we just cut that to short things so you can get your questions answered just by going through that it says over 200 clips of cat questions so paul thank you for that so all right as and it is com do it in the comments section on all your platforms we we audit those and look for unique questions that have not yet been asked about heaven and i don't think we would ever actually run out of questions because everyone's got a different angle in their question but anyway hey without further ado let's bring in cat kerr here welcome to cat curtain cat hi there good to see you good to see you kat um so uh now tell us about that logo that's right at the top there what tell tell us what that logo is that you put right in the center right yeah that is our spirit force logo that represents the new mentoring that i'll be doing all year long so if you didn't get to come to north carolina don't worry we'll have so many sessions of that some in person some online so that um you will get to hear about it it is represents revelation on what it is to be in the army of god not talking about heaven's army this is the one on earth this is us it's the body of christ and it won't change you people left change forever from those meetings very much empowered about what they can do on their own uh not just about what's going on right now in our country but for the rest of their life how to take authority and do and use every weapon god's given us as the body of christ it also brings us together in unity and you can even do this if you want to do spirit force you can do it with friends you can do online with other people yourself it's uh it's um very i guess portable i guess i don't want to say no know what to say but uh it can be used anywhere anytime in the world by any believer so it was really life-changing for people and i loved it i got to wear my commander cat to camera right oh i have to see that you have to i wore my military outfit which was not normal kind of for me yeah we are gonna make we're gonna it's one of the fashion lines we will make some spirit force fashion and put it on our website for everybody to have and i do want to remind people that um when i have an event myself in my own city or i go somewhere and rent a place myself there'll never be a charge to come to my meetings but if i'm invited by another person or a ministry to come that's up to them if they charge because if i come they have to have extra security extra ushers extra clean up people uh extra everybody if i come in in their in their place doubles you have to understand that the gospel is free which i've always told people but when you go to events somebody paid for something i mean it cost for more electricity for more parking attendance if you've got hundreds of extra people coming in and i'm on their side i understand but god just told me i personally cannot charge for any of my own events that are in my own venues some people misunderstood that they didn't know why they had to pay ten dollars ten bucks that's a burger and fries people and you get a life change that was for them to help pay for all the extra people and things they had to get there and it was certainly worth it but they just misunderstood so if it's my own venue that i'm having and i'm advertising and you're coming to my my place here the places we we get here in jacksonville we we will never charge you to come and so just please understand that why they have to do that if they're getting pushed with all these extra people and they haven't had people for registration i could just go on children's church workers i mean if the kids are there so just hang in there it's going to be okay yeah what whatever they do and i say yes to that they'll let me say whatever god wants me to say which is the best part and so but it was very very powerful the meanings were powerful and i'm going to really enjoy doing spirit force and even as i'm speaking about it and training people he shows me more about that yeah so that's what this this is a logo god gave me actually on purpose on the fake inauguration day january 21st 2020 i think is that when it was and that was probably the 20th but i don't know maybe 21. that's right okay okay and and on that day on purpose during the fake during the fake inauguration from the stolen election god downloaded spirit force in me to be one of the ways that we can come against the enemy trying to do stuff and let me tell you it will begin to change things in your own life first and i i love the humor of god also in operating in the power of god but his humor he could have done any day but chose that day on purpose that's good by the way one more comment about you know for 25 years we've been doing this and when we do conferences we would because we'd fly them we'd have to pay to fly in the speakers because you can't invite someone to go and then make them pay their own way it doesn't make any sense so we we do that but then people would write and say this gospel is supposed to be free and i would write back and say you know if you go to a christian bookstore and you buy a christian book or a christian bible or christian music you know you're going to pay it for it and sometimes for very expensive prices and your nobody thinks anything about it because this is a bookstore and it's the same thing people wherever people gather or congregate and there's class and flying in you kind of sometimes you just have to charge them that's no they have to stand for any event it doesn't matter what event it is unless it's a free one but your city is putting on i mean then they charge but if you go to a game if you go to a movie if you go to a theater show you're paying for that because they have expenses and it costs to you know to put that on to enjoy so you shouldn't expect anything different really it's an event there's a lot of expenses and you're just helping in a small way to pay that and i'm just blessed that there are people who are excited enough and and want people to have revelation yeah and he invite me by the way i and this is a pardon me while i do this quick little rabbit trail but you know the lord revealed to me once i thought well yeah it's right there in the word isn't it judas carried around the money bags where did the money come from that was putting people would come and decide to donate they would have to he carried it with them they would have come to jesus or the disciples and say i want to give to this where do you put it they would say well here judas got the money back you know however you know so they weren't charging for it of course but people wanted to willingly give into it so that was important remember he did feed people most of the time he fed the crowds sometimes he did it by multiplying the food sometimes they went out and bought the food oh really in the bible well i didn't know that i didn't know that they sometimes paid for it wow they did because one time they said when they when they had the crowd and um i think it may have been the time he did multiply the food but the disciples said there's no place we can buy food you know for these people that's true yeah jesus when he put on when he put on a meeting he did it right but most of the time he did feed the crowds wow wow that's amazing there you go people there you go there you go well listen cat we'll jump what we always open with is if there's anything you have to say but these times are getting really exciting and tense and amazing and the the mainstream media is freaking out more and more uh because there there's a a bullseye put on what some of the things that they're saying but what would you like to say about anything current i do have to anytime i find something i'm allowed to share i'm going to share it and if you all will remember i have been saying there'll come a time when the news media themself you know there is news media there's big newspapers and run all over the country and there's other ways that they put out the news besides just these you know the the networks that we used to watch it on uh there's many other sources even sources online now there's networks there's uh programs there's news media online well once again one of the traditional secular news media sources have finally opened their mouths to tell the truth in writing the new york times people really that used to be a huge supporter of the left and what they wanted to do until they have found they're beginning to find out it's not so good after all they actually did post in the new york times about the whole um uh biden son thing in the computer that that that is true that it was all scandal that was planned that it was criminal activity so it's in the new york times say that and this was actually posted by a legitimate source that really knew what they were saying so i don't know what day they did it but if you want to go search up the new york times and put in there probably the buying laptop i'm not sure what they call the whole thing it's like the buying laptop yeah yeah or criminal activity whatever they called it but yes it has been found out that is true that there is um criminal activity going on in in in in that in the biden thing with his son and so they've gotten more uh now there's even more people investigating that whole thing and they're what's happening is they're digging up more stuff as they're finding that part we're like okay if that was a lie all along what else was a lie exactly exactly and as i have said before there are people who didn't have their soul compromised by the fake news for like six years or four years they actually kept their own mind and made decisions uh to choose liberalism and other stuff but they're realizing now if we don't do something the whole country is going to be taken away from us and they themselves who were supporting financially and by putting not true things in their paper they're realizing if we don't stop and start exposing we'll have nothing because you know that person who's doing all this the bee person doesn't care who fails who loses i mean and they're not i keep saying this they're not making bad decisions on their choices they're on purpose choosing yes exactly this is strategic right now they're using to take our country away that is what their plan is that's their plot and plan that's why they want to put evil things in or evil regulations make their own laws without any voting being done what do you think they're doing yeah i know it sounds like they don't have a lot of brains in their head right now i get to like to be really honest okay uh but they're planning no matter who's controlling that's their plan who's allowing it and agreeing with it and going along with it they're all guilty but i can tell you there's there's a few networks now every now and then fox will say something or somebody on fox whether it's hannity or someone else will actually tell you truth that's going on but more and more it's going to be people like newsmax or right side or whatever online they'll always they'll always tell the truth about things and there's even more there's whole networks like we said there would be being formed and launched news networks online some are christians some are secular and they're going to start to rise up because people know they can trust what they're saying they'll be saying just the opposite of all the others but the other ones are losing and i keep saying people and it's not hidden either i will just say this uh cnn has lost 30 of the viewership and that's in black and white that's in traditional newspapers that's been said on other news channels so it's not just me saying that it's already been that's already been released thirty percent of the viewership that's gonna hurt your pocketbook people that's gonna hurt your account that you run things with and if they keep they said that they can't they cannot this is it they can't decide to say something new and i've noticed when i travel overseas they'll ask me what's wrong with your news people they're not mine they're stuck in a ditch with their soul compromised and they they've lied so much they believe it their self they can't stop saying what they're saying because they themselves have been deceived that is what is wrong it's whatever's in your soul is going to come out and until their soul changes they're not going to be able to change but so that is the legal those are real numbers that have been put out uh in the newspapers out over the air that they've lost 30 percent of their viewership because they can't stop saying what they're saying and people are tired of not getting news yeah yeah their viewership is crumbling fox was our go-to for so long that we stopped watching fox unless you watch tucker carlson i think is the most pure voice that i've seen the hannity sometimes his reports on the left once in a while but uh he's close to being trusted and and tucker who's probably the most trusted voice on fox this is my opinion but even i've even seen um i hate to say it but i've even seen newsmax begin to report deep state stuff about what's really going on in ukraine yeah they're reporting what the deep state wants it to report and for all of our viewers and friends of yours this is getting to be a place where you not only hear the word of the lord as it's revealed but you hear true stories about what's really going on uh it's gonna it's getting to be kind of a trusted news source not that we set out to do it that way but what kept you said i think that was god's plan though yeah i think it was and so once in a while we'll tell you uh some something that's true you know one of the things that if you see suddenly someone capitulate like new york times a lot of times they're doing it because they know something's about to blow there's they've they've got inside information something's a blow about to blow up in their face so they rush in there and say well we want to tell you that we now know that the hunter biden thing was false yeah you're right but they do know this too they are truly news people and if they find out there's really truth leaking by by bonafide sources that know what they're saying and these may be regular people who gave them tips before and now they've just been ignoring them all sometimes there's some you just can't ignore and you're right they don't want to be left behind if this blows on some other big network or a newspaper they want to make sure they're out there so they wouldn't be saying it if it was not true so i can let you know the truth is going to come out and no one's going to stop that from happening and it won't be over uh i'm not saying things won't begin to change drastically for us they will before that probably does end because it may take a while to um bring justice in every area against every person but it is going to happen okay there you go that's my exciting times as men will like to say these are glory days not gloomy days and i think that's right you know you know it's we we got to get to the transition and sometimes the transition is painful someone wrote me today and said well not almost everybody one of your guests agree and they mentioned you and they agree and they agree and they talked about how they're being encouraged and someone said that they were freaking out because the uh they needed to quickly buy gold because the you know the rapture was short time away and the only way to survive is to have gold and i'm thinking it might not hurt to have gold but but i i wrote her a nice long letter that will probably copy to anyone else that has that same objection you know i have a little bit of gold i have a little bit of silver but you know that's not going to save you the lord is going to save you if we have three weeks of um the chain you know the what do we call it the something chain uh anyway i can't think of the name of it but it's got the word my head knowledge isn't working very well yeah but it's like when the food the food chain and the you know the the truck chain and all that there's a better word for it but someone will write it down the supply chain thank you illumination the supply chain if it gets if there's two or three weeks where it's tough and make sure you keep your gas up there and you're grocery stocked well well it's good because maybe we'll have two or three weeks of a tough time but that's not gonna bring the rapture because we have three weeks of uh you know food shortage it doesn't look anything like it's going to win that time i can promise you that this is right before right before almost any time in the bible when god was going to do something powerful the enemy always acted up and no matter what source satan used to try to do all this uh taking away or stopping things from happening it never worked back then and it's not going to work right now because he only gets a few short years at the end of all this and we're a long ways away from that happening we have not even begun to see the glory of god the baptism and fire manifested sons and daughters speaking to the land sea and the air and it's doing something immediately that's that's just starting to begin in those days so god has to clean the slate people and push back darkness so we can operate freely freely in power and authority ourselves speaking and changing things which is operating in the kingdom that jesus always talked about you barely you've heard him talking about the kingdom but we've barely been operating it trust me because the way he talked about it that would be it be a major game changer to be in the kingdom and in every area of your life it's going to change as we understand that and start doing it it will make a major difference in this physical world so good so good well kat let's get into some questions about heaven or related to heaven i have one that's partially personal but it has to do with what you've talked about let me ask you several questions about that but you talked about the welcome center in heaven that people go to here's my question so uh we used to say we lost so and so and we're learning that not to say we lost a dream um saw her brother go home saw but her brother went home to be with the lord this week so he has two brothers and the oldest one would went home to be the lord now he loved the lord very much i had kind of a tough life because he'd been in the accident that dream was in when she was six years old and the parents were killed so he'll go up there to see the priest the first one to see her parents but so he his particular theology of this denomination is he absolutely believed in his heart of hearts that he would lay in the grave everything that was him body mind soul all of it would lay there if it was a hundred years it would later for a hundred years he would not go to heaven until the resurrection so he went home last week we know he went home so when he shows up at the welcome center does he go and realizes that he's ahead of all of the rest of us we're not there does he does he go wait what or does it do is it so changed that he never even realizes what how does that oh no he's going to go yes [Laughter] i did get to go oh my goodness they were right that's what he's going to say then he's going to run over the place trying to see as much as he can see and then someone say come on we'll show you all about it and then lead him into the welcome center that you really see like a big scope of heaven itself which which answers so many questions already of what is actually there and what you get to do and uh and how you do things with family or you meet family from your family line 500 years ago i mean there's so much you can consider even people knowing yes those mansions will have a beautiful place we'll get the fellowship together it's going to be great it's so beyond that and that's why the bible says eye has not seen nor ear heard and this is the part i like nor enter into the mind of man so there's things up there you never even thought or considered would or could be there and i think those are the things that really people are like they're not afraid at all and they're not really even upset they're like delighted and amazed that there is so much more there than they even dreamed of and it's all god it's all good i mean there's just so much fun and excitement and adventure and and so you go in the welcome center which i still love god's sense of humor it's run by people uh that actually own funeral homes the heart of family i don't mind even saying it i've heard you the hardest family in our city to own funeral homes and richard hardick who was like the head he was in the father there was a father and many brothers like six or seven brothers and you knew they all were in the same family and they went to our church of the big church we used to go to when we first came here to florida and they were kind and they would they would always get people at ease it was a gift and god said he gave them a gift to comfort people to make them understand it's going to be okay and they just said that that's this was the way they all were so they all ran this whole line of funeral homes here and i actually had the pleasure of giving a word from god to richard hardage and he was probably about to pass two months after that himself and said he'd never gotten a word from god in his life and he god maybe he said this whole family operated in excellence their funeral homes operated in excellence in every way so richard will get his word in excellence and he made me get a parchment scroll and write it in gold ink and then they had to attach these beautiful things uh on the scroll so it looked like one not maybe not anything like what you get in heaven but if they give you a scroll in heaven it's embellished it talks i mean now i didn't speak but it did give god's word to him for and he actually told richard this is what you'll be doing in heaven when you get there and how many people get that word this is what your family's doing mentions his brothers their names um and why he chose them and i think the humor of the lord is that um he did he did say one funny thing in this scroll that made richard he was standing on the sidewalk outside of his home his funeral home he was visiting going to visit um and i just god told me to go at that time and there he was on the sidewalk and he knew he knew me he didn't know it was a prophet but he knew me from my family and i told him he was undone but the funny thing he said to richard then he says this is to be a delightful place you'll bring such comfort to the people who don't know what's going on there'll be a psalm like is this heaven this is amazing why are they dancing why are they singing people are like eating there's food appearing in the air and they're flying on color and they're like you know they're undone although you feel the presence of god and they see the throne and they see the river of life so he said you will be able to comfort them you will be operating the welcome center in heaven he said you used to get them when they were going to heaven you will now get them when they're coming to heaven so beautiful so beautiful i mean yeah they had they had to be the see their people their the people that they loved to serve but they saw them on their darkest darkest dark you're right you're right so they were they're going to have comfort the minute they're touching comfort flu in them and excitement started going in them instead so they leave so excited then they can really not wait to to get out there and where they got to go to the throne first and be welcomed by the father and jesus walks them up the steps of the throne and they're so thrilled that guess what they didn't have to stay in their own body because your soul and your spirit don't sleep so that would be like sticking you in a casket away yeah that's what it would be like if that happened because your spirit man's awake all the time so is your soul where are you stuck in a box you do nothing i know it says to be absent from the body that's your spirit man it's gonna be present with the lord and we all know he is in heaven so that scripture shows you right there uh you're not gonna sleep in your in your body the bodies of what decays and or or gets you know a cremated which is okay if you want to have that done you can put every other ashes back together he can he is going to raise that body up one day your spirit man will go back into your body and explode out of that grave or out of the urn or wherever it is i think that'd be one of the greatest days to be here if you were on earth it would be great to see all this happening around you and then because the people in heaven get to get their body first people yeah and that's very very cool if you're still here you're standing in your natural body i better take a drink just a minute yeah i was a quick a quick pointer note is that when i was raised but bruce dreams brother doreen and i had that same exact belief that's the way we were raised we thought you're laying the grave that's it because there were certain scriptures they pointed but they never had an answer for if you have to be absent from the bodies to be present with the lord it's very very very very clear you know but somehow they this one other scripture made them swing everything over this way so i was such a to me um i would just encourage people that happen to be raised like that that you go to be with the lord and it would be good and i asked them this question if you knew you went to be with the lord instead of laid in the grave would that be good news and i asked that question most people say well yeah be good news but i don't believe it but would it be good news yeah well yeah they don't want to believe it they just feel like they have to when i tell people you're gonna find out one day anyway it doesn't matter what they're saying you'll just find out when it happens to you and you will be happy i had a question about because when you first talked about the welcome center i'm seeing this quaint little building with the welcome center but the reality is it has to be a hundred thousand people joining coming to that center a day i would think have you seen the size of it at home glorious heaven divine supernatural architecture where the buildings are speaking to you and making music before you ever get up there the glory of god's blinding out of every one of these doorways there's no door there's not a door there's arches that you just walk into this beautiful place engulfed in his presence before you ever get to the throne room you're so undone at that point it's okay with you're okay with anything you know so that would that would remove any kind of confusion right there so no it is very it's a very beautiful building it's got lights in it it's got colors coming out of it it looks almost iridescent and yet it's solid at the same time so i have a question about there and maybe you may or may not know this kind of a the answer this kind of question but anyone that's a child whether they're in india uh hindu india or buddhist china or whatever anyone that's a child goes to be with the lord is that right when they die it's absolutely true they all children and babies they all go to heaven every single one of them go to heaven so i don't know if you've ever seen some of them were never taught about a jesus or jesus they would have never heard the gospel so i don't know what what that would seem like they they're dying of aids or whatever starvation in some of these countries so they don't even know that there's a future for them some of these kids right jesus is the first one that meets them they already know who he is before they ever get to heaven wow amazing well okay i have a next question here um this is pat asks this question he says when you've said we are with the father before he sends us to the earth in others we were in him is it just our spirit that is with him or is it or is it our spirit and soul they're trying to figure out how this thing works and i want to add to that this whole since we're talking about what's what's in there with the father does he tell us um what we're about to experience does he tell us the way the life will be that it'll be hard if he knows that or does he is it a blank slate and the soul has never been told what's what the future holds i don't know how to ask that question but go ahead and i do know there's many different things that happen in this and he does talk to us he does he talks he talks to everybody but everyone who ever was is in there you know if they haven't been born yet they're still in him so you're talking about probably billions of spirits still little spirits you're a little spiritual being and they're not all the same size i mean some are real tiny some are a little bit bigger and you get a little shift thing to wear and uh it's a little outfit clothing music clothing really and yeah but you don't look necessarily like you yet because the physical body is what gives you your your physical identity your physical body does but god knows every one of us he knows the plans he has for us it says every day of your life was written written in a book or squirrel before he sent you here and so he did know things that he would go through but he knew the great things he had for you and when you go to heaven he's going to give that to you and you will actually see and like i said there's no regret so i know in your natural mind right now you're thinking well i'll be sad if i find out i could have had that or i could have done that i'll be upset no you won't it's not like that what god is showing you is the goodness he always had planned for you but we do have a devil on this earth who hates everybody who wants to take away whatever he can take from us or get us on the wrong path and yet god stays as much as he can with you to guide you you may not have had the best parents on the earth but again everybody makes choices you make choices your whole life and maybe made some wrong choices but when you get to having you be so delighted and love jesus christ and love the father and love holy spirit that none of that stuff from the past can touch you or affect you at all but as far as being the little spirits inside of him it's very uh i think the best explanation i can give is when he made adam when adam was made you have a soul you wouldn't be a whole thing okay your spirit and your soul are like one they're two different parts of you your spirit man is uh is the the carrier of your soul and it's really the way you have to say it because your soul is one of the most important parts of you your spirit man is important or you wouldn't be able to have a way for your soul to be transported around but you couldn't decide am i gonna as a little tiny spirit you could you have a few things you decide but you weren't living outside of god in heaven somewhere you didn't have to decide who am i gonna go visit today what am i going to go eat today you didn't have to eat when you lived in him he was your life and it says in him you live you move you have your very being and everybody thinks it's talking about jesus but it's actually the father we lived in the father we didn't live inside jesus christ okay we lived in the father and he carried us until he decided to make this physical earth he made the earth for really one reason so we could have a body that's the way he designed all of it that you wouldn't be forever inside of him you would then be your own person you got to make your own choices so yeah you had your soul you could decide am i going to run up the hill to listen to him his powerful hill is it talks about the hill inside of him his holy hill am i going to swim in the river of life i'm going to jump in the bins of the rainbow i'm going to ride them outside you could ride outside of god then back in you can even see them doing that if you're ever before the throne really even jessie saw that jesse the planet saw that a little girl who was caught up to heaven saw that she caught them fireflies because your spirit man is made out of light so you did have a few choices you could make but your soul was kind of inactive so when he made adam let's just not add him yeah it was adam yeah there's correcting me my my natural brain is still trying to reconnect after sharing spirit forces for several days when went back in genesis you can go look at yourself when when god made adam god i usually say god that's the father jesus who was called the word would step out of the father and the father would say a word in the word which is also jesus made the body of adam and it was perfectly made it was laying there i know people have other more versions or detailed versions of it but basically the word made him and he was lying there he had no life in him the body that was just the body that was laying there and the father because he carries all the spirits remember leans over and breathes adam's specific spirit of life that was his little spiritual being breathed into adam's nostrils where there was no life breathed his spirit man adam's spirit man in his nostrils into his body and it said adam became a living soul now why would he say that because his soul was then alive it wasn't dormant okay and your soul is what makes your decisions it's your mind your will and your emotions your soul is you or he wouldn't call adam a living soul in other words from that day forward adam had to make his own choices and choose what he was going to do what he was going to say where he was going to go so we lived inside the father until it was time for us to be here on the ears and then he would send us and and at the time of conception at conception not later on when you're being born that's a lie from the left people okay when you're at the time of conception the holy spirit brings your little spirit of life from the father and knits and attaches you to that diet of flesh in the womb the scripture says i knit you together in the womb true think well that means he puts his arm in his legs on no he knit you you're a little spiritual man oh i see i see what i mean yeah i thought i honestly thought it must have been referring to your arms and legs and you know no okay no because man can't make a spirit man can't make a spirit no man made our spirit that came from the father where he lived so at the time of conception when that takes place that's when life begins when conception takes place and that thing really happens that spirit of life is brought from the father by holy spirit he goes in the womb and attaches you so i guess you don't go back to heaven attaches your little spirit to that dot of flesh and as your body grows in the mother it that that spirit man adapts to that fleshly appearance to your body that's good and then you are a person and then when you're born so you're still you in the womb it's you you were sent from the father that little spirit man was attached to that god of flesh and as the baby grows in the womb not some other thing your spirit man grows right along with your body and then the baby even as a baby can hear things said to it while they're in the womb it likes when the baby's born sometimes they like a particular music if you played it while you were carrying that baby if you play special music that music will come for that baby after it's born because it's accustomed it knows your voice it knows the voice of the mother because as they're carrying the baby it can hear a lot of mothers trust me i did it i spoke to my baby all the time in the womb total couldn't wait to see it that i was going to love it it would be a part of our lives and that's the way every baby that's the experience every baby should have when it's in the womb but life begins at conception and what is birthed eight or nine months later whenever that happens is a human being it's a living soul with a living soul in it and babies learn as they grow to make choices their cell so that's how that whole thing happens you lived in the father in him you lived you moved you can move in and out on the rays of the rainbow you couldn't go any further then you'd ride back in and that you we all enjoy doing that or you play in the river of life you jump on the stones of fire that's why we like sparkly things because god had them inside of him the father did so you just had uh you really had the big picture about you that's where you came from that's where you were first in heaven inside the father then he sent you to this earth to do something for him to be here for him and to know him have you seen any any specifics like it's transition time it's time for you to come out of the father and to be sent to the earth at that moment i guess of conception that's the moment you go is there a send-off does he say i'm giving it to this mom and dad or are you suddenly there what do you mean because they're they're aware that they're not in him anymore obviously they're aware it's not like they're asleep your spirit man doesn't sleep actually and within him i mean there was no time where god had a break because we didn't take naps when i've seen inside the father several times and saw them playing and laughing together and i would also see him put his hand down and someone climb in he'd bring them out and talk to them while he's getting on the throne he'd say i've chosen you to be this or to do this but you'll have to choose it later in your life because he was writing it down so he knew what i'd be doing when i was in him he knew where i'd go he knew the parents that having you the choices uh praying the choices what would happen but he does know what you will become of what he has pushed this is the thing he does he writes the thing he does do steve before he sends you to be knit together to your mother he writes on your soul oh really male or female really yes because he knows which one you will become he's been from the beginning to the end and the end of the beginning he knows what you're going to become male or female so that's why there's so much conflict when someone tries to change that what that god has called them to be and puts all the body parts on them to be male or female if they try to twist that and be something else your soul will always have conflict with you and i literally have talked to homosexuals before who got born again i've talked to some who aren't and they say they always their soul and they call this all my soul is always in conflict with me so something is not right yeah and i did read uh someone i led them over the phone years ago to know jesus christ when i showed them i would read parts of the word how they lived in him how he sent them how they got their spirit man that he has to purpose them and it says in the body he made them male or female it doesn't say you get to be a third thing okay that's the devil's plan to twist your identity so you will not become what god wants you to become and they feel like if we can do that we'll steal the destiny that's what that's all about it's not your mind making decisions that is satan twisting who god made you to be so you would do great things for him or help humanity and they know that the satan knows if i can get them off on another path is totally opposite they'll never be a threat to him the same might be who god wants him to be and i might as well add this for free i did see a day on the earth when millions of homosexuals would have the blinders removed and they would run to be a part of the kingdom they would run to be born again in mass but to jesus christ awesome awesome awesome you know and on that all the whole thing about knitting in the womb i'm thinking the more and more and more the young women older women some who have had abortions the more and more that they see what really happened the less will have abortions and probably i don't know the conviction of what happened to some and they'll repent for the first time when they hear this summer probably repenting now because they didn't realize this when they had an abortion my heart of compassion goes out to them because they didn't mean to be murderers in their minds they convinced themselves that this was those things some of them were forced yeah i mean they were forced if they were young especially their parents would force them thinking they were doing the best thing and any time i have meetings almost anywhere i will mention that and they do get born again and then i tell them name your babies that are in heaven they know at that point i've done it in book signings this one lady had five abortions and i just god will tell me talk about this when i'm at my book table signing books and i start talking she started crying and weeping she said i'm receiving jesus christ right now in this moment not receiving christ and i said well your babies are probably allowed to watch you receive christ because now they know that their mother will become heaven they'll be celebrating and she said right at that table this is the crazy thing the day that happened and people started running inside the bookstore i've got uh the spirit of god on me right now come and see what's in the sky really over the bookstore was this gold cloud it was not a normal cloud all the clouds in the sky it was still like daylight this cloud was glorious gold and you could see little images i didn't we didn't know who they were i figured they probably were the babies little images like five little images and an angel there it was just crazy i think somewhere i have a picture of it if i could find a picture and i was telling where that is that was a long time ago that's like in 2008 or seven or something like probably eight 2008 but that woman at that moment realized she had babies in heaven she wanted those babies she wrote me later and thanked me for that and she said i i've actually picked all the names of the names i picked i've had plaques put on the wall saying these are my children and and she had other children told them about the children that they had siblings in heaven so it majorly changes people's lives when they realize that wasn't nothing totally yeah saying what the devil does do the devil will beat them up for the rest of the life i was going to say that because he didn't talk to her or somebody did he'll try to beat him up the whole rest of the life that they did yeah i was going to say that because people think well god because he knows it's killing a baby he's angry no it's the devil that's beating you up it's god that's wooing you to realize what happened yeah we can restore you and your body yeah he loves you love he loves you and he loves those babies in heaven he wants those babies to have that have their mother or their mother and father if you know who that is but they didn't just it stopped existing and let me tell you the second they stepped out of that little body jesus was there to meet them their own angel who comes at the time of conception their own angels are already there with them and they'll carry them home many times jesus meets them in heaven right away and then he'll sit down and he'll hold them and love them and talk to them and later they grow slowly i do know this also later on uh not that they have to but later on they have a ceremony in heaven where all the little babies will bring flowers and they will sit on the lap of christ and receive them as their savior even those are already in heaven really really they want to they want to do that so they receive him as their savior even though they've already arrived in you know not paradise is not the technical name for it but they've they've arrived in heaven oh that's right that's very interesting well i have a question for you and that a few minutes ago you said jesus stepped out of the father and then i think he was regarding adam and he created i don't remember exactly how i said but many times you said the father decides what's to be made and then jesus steps out and makes it so the question is does god create things or does he only make decisions and jesus is the only creator because i've only heard you talk about jesus as the creator and the scripture says there's nothing made that has been made except it was made by jesus so what what's your what do you got what's your understanding because the word was with god and was god and there's nothing that was not made that was not that was not made by the word they did it together but the reason why his name was the word was because they would go somewhere jesus would step in the word would step inside the father he'd go where there was nothing and the father would stand there and say something the word stepped out and made it they have almost always worked together in what they did and you realize even back in genesis 2 when it said the spirit of god hovered over the water so the holy spirit is also involved and that's why they're called the triumph god head they can step inside of each other that's why they're the three in one okay they're not just they don't stay that way but they have the ability to do that so whenever creation something's going to be created the father just lets the word make it that's what he does and so the word made everything that was ever made but he went by what the father said he stepped out and made his words that he spoke that's so good now um i want to ask this next question and you had mentioned that there were some little spirits and some bigger spirits and it made me think of this question which was actually next to my list anyway this steffi asks um and i'd like to experience what it's like to be tall i've been short since i was a child can we change some some of those dimensions height and all of that in heaven well i would just say this you know jesus himself can be as high or small as he wants to the father if you have to say he said we're made in their image and we operate like they do that's why he made us so eventually in heaven you can be as tall as you want you can be as short as you want lesson i remember a little girl you're not just stuck in something it's always going to be you you'll just be tall or short or whatever but i remember a little girl asked me one time a question she said i want to ask god a question when i get to having can i have a conversation with an a can i be as small as an aunt and before she could even finish it the father said tell her i said yes she can be the size of an if she wants to and she can have conversations with him all the time she wants to and then she can go right back to being herself so he answered that uh for that little girl and i do know yeah people can be tall for a while they can be short but it's still going to be you um people can do all kinds of things in heaven they you do fly i haven't really openly said that anybody can fly in heaven you have a place where you learn though you do get to learn you go by this place called flyby near the amusement park and you learn how to fly because you know he wouldn't just throw you out there and say go for it um there's no telling what you wouldn't get hurt but and people say can i have wings that's another question can i have wings well he might let you have some for a while but you wouldn't know what to do with the wings either you think oh some things you don't automatically know uh and i think that um there are those who were on the air that actually train you how to do that and then you can fly around the amusement park or whatever so and i do know i guess if you really want to have wings i don't know why he wouldn't let you have them probably for a while or maybe that would be a fun experience but how are you going to put your clothes on with wings how would you walk through the door if you turned around you knocked people over um wings are not little tiny baby wings people they're like eight foot ten foot if you're five and a half foot you can have like eight foot wings and you don't need them i think it would be a fun thing to watch people have wings and walk around but you don't need wings to fly but people probably want wings because they want to fly but you can fly without wings right so yes you can so okay ah what was i going to ask you um okay i said i did this one okay uh this question i almost didn't ask it because okay but it's not my question so i'm going to ask you because it's her question lenta is the name kat mentioned she was taken back to the tomb when jesus rose from the dead my question is did jesus know that cat was there watching the scene he's timeless was it possible that he saw a cat witnessing the moment so i don't know what kind of uh i'm i'm perfectly sure that he knew that i was there really really i'm sure he knew yeah he was well the reason i say this because i've heard because i've heard bobby connor say he was at the crucif he bobby was at the entire crucifixion so there must be thousands of people who god has shown maybe that's wrong this kind of experience that happened i think there are probably many people and people just are afraid to talk about i think they're nuts but he he chooses and picks where he takes me because i'm going to share it he only shows me what he wants me to share and i'm pretty sure jesus didn't take time and i was back in time i wasn't in this now time when i saw that it wasn't a dream it wasn't a vision it wasn't um uh whatever else they have those things they call i was literally carried back in time when it actually happened and i saw mary come out of the tomb i i know what she thought he was a gardener because he was standing in the flower beds jesus loved flowers but you have to remember on the cross he was in his physical body when i saw him he was in his glorified body that was a little different okay say that again say that two sentences again when he saw him on the cross he was in his physical body hanging on the cross right when i saw christ he was in his glorified resurrected body was his glorified body it wasn't just his physical body that got taken out it was glorified it says he was the first to be glorified in the he was the first bible yeah he was my body when he walked this earth he was still in his human body his spirit man i mean it was still him and he could work miracles but he didn't have his glorified body yet the glory he carried on the inside was now on the outside which is also one of the reasons why she had a little bit maybe not quite sure i mean the light was coming out of him everywhere when i saw him he was already out of the tomb but that was his glorified body now because he is a witness that's a testimonial witness he keeps his scars on purpose to search oh yes but we in our glorified bodies when you go to heaven you won't have scars on your spirit man there are no scars on your spirit being at all yeah i don't want any scars just don't have them that was your flesh that had them and i'm not sure uh in our glorified bodies i can't see why we would want scars or anybody would want something missing off of them i know your body is whole completely whole and in perfect shape and young again um uh you'll be young through all eternity nobody's going to be old but jesus when i saw him was in his glorified body so i have a question about that because i when i was raised i think they i think i was taught that you know they mary tried to you know hold the jesus back and he said don't detain me or don't keep me here because i've not yet ascended to the father and i think someone i think the teaching was he had to go to the father and be glorified but you're saying he was already glorified yes so it was the thing to the father did they have a massive ceremony of celebration uh is that when he poured his blood out is that what he had to send to the father and pour out his blood his blood was presented as the evidence yeah uh but he already had the glory on him okay uh when we're when one day when we are all raised from the dead that means our spirit man if you're living in heaven you're being your spirit man and that spirit man will be joined back together to that body and instantly glorified you can never sin you can never be sick you can never leave christ for all eternity you are in the glory the glory is wrapped around you and in you and you'll have light coming out of you like i saw coming out of christ so um yeah those are whole different different times in our life that we will experience things but but i do know that christ when i saw him now i have to say i saw him in his spiritual body i've seen him many times since all that happened i've seen him a lot uh since all that happened but i did see him when he was in um paradise i was taken back and showing him in paradise in his spiritual body his physical body was in the tomb so his spiritual body was wonderful i mean uh he he had the light of life uh in his face and he was speaking to all those who were in paradise that's who he preached the gospel to they were they were held captive there they were held captive in paradise in other words they couldn't leave there they didn't have the ability to just go up to heaven then or anywhere they lived in that beautiful place called paradise or abraham's bosom it's the same place and jesus in his spiritual man preached the gospel to them in his spiritual body and then he crossed over to hell still in his spiritual body and so uh when all that was all done that time was over the three days were over in hell that his spiritual body rose up through hell picked up his physical body and it was glorified at that moment so from that moment nobody would have been able to attack christ number one they couldn't appear so they couldn't hurt him they could have done nothing to him at that time he was in his glorified body he had to go back to heaven to present the blood that was collected by the angels it was collected by the angels and it had been poured out on the mercy seat before the throne of god to show the father here it is this is why i went here it is for all time he had the ability to forgive sins for those who repented and the blood is the evidence and of course i had a huge celebration but i didn't stay i didn't get to stay for the celebration that was all going on when that part was done and the throat the floor opened before the throne and everybody's looking down they can hear satan screaming and yelling of putting his fist in the air screaming no because he had just been defeated wiped out all the gemstones stripped off of him how doesn't the grave taken away from him by the son of god wow in his spiritual body taken away from him he was defeated before every demon and they knew that christ won they knew it they knew christ won that was one show that christ put on and he made a show of it openly it says so in colossians he's spoiled and ruined principalities and powers the highest level there is in hell they don't live in hell they're on thrones around the world ruling the evil and he stripped everything uh he stripped away and ruined their features by melting them i've heard you talk about it i have a question too some are teaching or have taught maybe it's correct but i i've never really sat in the teaching that when christ died he said on the cross it's finished there are other people then that would say he went into hell and had to experience that did he have to experience anything or was it done done done when he went well i can i totally know exactly what the answer to that question is okay it was finished for the salvation of sins okay that was finished okay that part was done when he died and his blood was poured out and he died when he said it is finished he meant the sacrifice was finished and from that moment on he could forgive sins for anyone who repented there was something else he had to do he had to go take the authority back that adam gave away okay see did you suffer in any of that god was different that that was a sacrifice of himself right as being god who died for shed his blood that was finished okay knowing for all time could take that right away from him or stop that from happening there was one more thing he had to do and that was to go into hell and take away from satan the authority that adam had given him adam gave him authority by choosing what this what satan said to him in the garden and everything changed for adam they couldn't live in the garden where everything was freely given to them they were in the presence of god walking with him that ended because they chose to the deception they chose to lie that changed everything so jesus had to go into hell and take away the keys of hell death and the grave he had to take all the glory off of satan that he still wore that was the gemstones and according to ezekiel 28 go read ezekiel 28 people and you will hear about it when when god said when god was speaking and he said had said that he would walk upon satan used to walk upon the stones of fire that was inside the father those are inside the father lucifer used to step inside the father and lead worship from inside him when it was he was the anointed one he was anointed to step into the father to lead worship every angel in heaven could not just step into the father and the father is the one who has a rainbow coming in and out of him jesus doesn't have the rainbow coming in and out of him he wears part of one but he is the son he is the son of god he jesus has flames of fire he has a lightning power of god in his hands and he and he releases the anointing so he had his things that made him a little bit different than the father but the father had us in him it said he wasn't called him the mini breasted one because he nourished us and and fed us with his presence while we lived in him now when okay so i i've got our time is always right i got two more quick questions too first of clarification when the cross happened and he said it is finished was jesus suffering done or did any suffering take place when he when he went to paradise or hell did he suffer was there anything he had to suffer he did not physically suffer or spiritually suffer you know it was i think more of an emotional one because for those three days he was separated from the presence of the okay that's guess what i was trying to get at i guess yeah it was that kind of suffering they never they never got to torture him they were planning that for the third day people they were planning on the third day since the father didn't show up the first day didn't show up the second day satan planned the show and i can prove it because principalities don't stay in hell he called all the principalities in from around the earth so they could watch satan wanted them to watch him torture the son of god so no he never got to do that the only torment for him was being separated from the voice and the presence of the father but when that was over when that part was over and satan and satan was about to get uh uh cut down by jesus christ he put the biggest show on earth that ever had happened actually in the earth one shell was in heaven when the father kicked him out the other second show was in inside the earth and the third one will be on the earth by the manifested sons and daughters of god very very cool okay so one of our viewers just got a question into into us and he he wrote or she i don't see if i have a name as a viewer had a question cat will i go to hell if i commit suicide so apparently this person might even be considering it i don't know so what's your how would you well i hope that they're not because they're really wasting their life and throwing their life away you will continue to live your spirit man lives eternally where it lives is up to you and i can't even answer that question because that depends on if it is actual suicide or if you're trying to escape the torment and the father on purpose told me this revelation some time ago he said not what everybody's doing you know there came a time that people thought you know if your life was taken that you you did that on purpose and and you didn't want to you know so it was called suicide but the father taught me that not everyone who commits something similar to that they're not wanting to die on purpose to never exist they're escaping the suffering and god is the only one who can decide that did you do this on purpose and then the father said go look up the word suicide in the dictionary i would encourage people to do that it says in the dictionary that suicide is willingly knowingly understanding that you are ending your own a life in other words you have all your faculties there's no emotions uh to consider there's no mental state of being they're saying you have all your mental fat faculties with no interference in your soul and you're still deciding to take your life most people who end their life are mentally messed up physically messed up or emotionally messed up so much so that their soul can't bear the suffering and they are ending their suffering now this is from the most high god if you don't like those words that's too bad you go you go talk to him he showed me this on purposes he said many of my my sons and daughters who belong to me ended their suffering i'm not going to overlook the fact that they received my son and they could no longer bear of the suffering maybe they had an accident maybe they were giving medicine to take that alter their thinking this has happened before it will alter the way you think or you go into great deep depression until you're in despair after despair hits you you're not going to be able to last here much longer and god is the only one that knows the thoughts and intents of your heart or your soul and he will make that decision but i was shown people in heaven that had ended their suffering because of the horror that they were living in the torment the horrible abuse whether it was mental emotional or physical they couldn't handle it anymore so they ended up suffering they went to heaven but if you in your natural mind with no outside things affecting you decide to do that that that would be called suicide yes it wouldn't be between you and god if um let me just ask i've never asked this question like this if someone is ready to end their life and they'll say and they say to themselves i'll show him or i'll show her what they did to me and that's gonna get you and then when you now you'll be sorry for how you treated me when i kill myself how about that i would say that depends on what they had been doing to them okay i mean if it was a horrible thing it was being done to them and they felt that way i wouldn't say they had complete control of the faculty and the father even said this to me said a good example to tell you if someone entering their suffering because the torment is so great and someone who actually committed suicide would be a terrorist okay and he used that word a terrorist bomber someone knowing and even right now i'm ready you know i'm going to blow them away and uh i i just will they won't exist anymore so i'm just going to go end my life by killing them that's suicide yeah that would be suicide uh like we know in 9 11. yeah and that doesn't count the suicide people on the plane the terrorists on the plane that was suicide they had going out partying many of them the night before they knew what they were going to do they had had meetings talking about it they knew they were knowingly willingly taking their own life and they wouldn't exist anymore that is suicide yeah and a lot of those people if it was a muslim terrorist a lot of them were taught that they were going to heaven by because of this act of killing people that was what they were taught in the reality they may be going to the the opposite way you know thinking about that the bottom line is this that was a promise that was different that's not torment that's not messing with their mental state or emotional state or physical state with their own mind in place they made a decision to take their own life and god said many times it is not just a terrorist but people who do that will also sometimes do it to harm or hurt on purpose i mean we have other people who who did things like that that weren't necessarily muslims from every walk of life almost yeah even people are paid they're saying well you know when you die you'll still whatever they say to them they choose to believe that they'll be better off or they're choosing to believe that i will hurt everybody in the city i'll cause great torment for them that's suicide okay the only way you can end your suffering is if you yourself are in severe abuse or terrible torment mentally physically or emotionally and god doesn't call that suicide that is from him that is his decision and so that's the only way i can explain it is got it okay i'm going to end on a uh happier note that was a heart that was a hard one um this is a question that escaped my mind and then i remembered it a little later and that was i had asked you once because we were talking about you can be what you want you can be taller if you want you and i had said well i want to be an athlete an athlete when i'm in heaven because i'm not that one now you said yeah you can be athletic if you want to be athletic so if someone says i want to be an artist i can't draw to save my life here but i want to be an artist in heaven i want to play the piano in heaven do they do they get that do they get to do that i'm sure they do but again as i said if it's not a gift that you were born with usually people who have that gift teach you so you probably would have to have some instruction i've seen people the reason why i know this i've seen artists teaching people who didn't do art before there's a place called the galleria in heaven where all the artists hang out or they probably live near that place there's art going on everywhere and and they do teach people i've seen people who danced have a studio uh they have a performance center so they can have full displays artists have a gallery of their own in heaven and they can display their art that they give away uh so i would say yes you and they have other people learning to do things that maybe they couldn't you learn it faster in heaven yeah your gift is so important whether it's any of those things we just talked about your gift will never be taken from you so if you were supposed to be if you were supposed to be an artist and all you did was get to do a few things when you stepped through the gates of heaven that would be fully activated you would be a legitimate artist a great artist no matter what um type of uh materials you used in that art that would happen you always put the singing only sing for friends because you never had a way to do that you would be singing in uh beautiful opera halls or performance centers in heaven your gift will not be taken from you so nobody actually misses their destiny not even children yeah so i and let me let me clarify this one question because i think now that i know you're talking about the gift versus what anything else a person goes to heaven they love all their gifts that they have but they say i never had the gift of piano playing or of artistry i've always wanted to have that gift because they tried to instruct me in school i just didn't get it i couldn't do the art part i want to be gifted would god give them an additional gift that they wanted in heaven maybe that's my question i don't think it's the way that you're saying it they still would have to be trained or no of course that's yes they would have to be trained but yes if you don't have the gift those who have that gift already there's a reason why he gave it to them is to use and display in heaven and bless people you also there to train people how to do great art only you don't need years to learn that you would pick it up really quick yeah because you're learning from an anointed person that has the anointing for that it's not like you'd have to take weeks months or years of classes but you will get instruction so what you do is you go look for somebody who has an artist studio or a gallery and go say yeah i want i want classes i want classes and and and then you would learn from them but it would still be it would still be beautiful it would be fantastic okay awesome

in the room we knew her brother was gonna she was hours away and she had gone to see him the week before she knew she wouldn't see him again she came in the room and i said uh she came in the room she says i just got a text to the family bruce passed about two hours ago and i said how are you doing with it she goes i'm fine i am relieved i'm happy for him i know he's in heaven so even though bruce didn't know exactly that he wouldn't lay in the grave for a while we knew where he was going you know he knew he was saved but he just died so she and we both sat there and talked she says ever since all the teaching by cat i've never looked at this the same we know where he's going she goes i feel rejoice she you know maybe she shed a tear when i wasn't looking i'm sure she must have but you know she knew her she's just celebratory all week we just went on with with live would there be a memorial later on a couple months from now actually in the summer so that was you kat it's because you taught us the beauties of that's what the heaven the father said it would help to despair dispel dispel the fear of death and i can timelessly honestly tell you this i never cried when my dad went i never cried when my brother i have two brothers and my dad up there and i already know what they're doing up there so let me tell you you exist to live in heaven uh there's no suffering there's no regrets there's joy unspeakable there's adventure this excitement um there's the glory you you you live in the glory all the time and you can't wait this is what they're thinking all the time i can't

well happy wednesday march 30 2022 welcome to the broadcast i'm steve schultz along with my wife doreen we've uh founded the elijah list 25 years ago and elijah streams is now the video portion of what you're watching and it's exciting times to be alive we got a great show with cat coming up here so excited to show you that i've got a couple of announcements that are fun to make um let's talk about let me do this uh jeff if you're ready uh let's run that native the uh the clip that we have from uganda about the wells this is this will be uh laurie sally her husband is not on camera but he's probably doing the video but laurie and her husband are the ones that get the wells dug for us there in uganda they are actually most of the time they're stateside with us i think it's they live in mississippi but this is their village that they built and oversee so they go over there and they have people over there they get the wells done so this is another clip from lori when she's with some of the people by one of the well so let's go ahead and run that yeah my name's uh pasta giorgio chisolo the senior pastor of ever increasing melaka church and uh also i'm fasting this community around you see here first of all i want to thank god for this opportunity has brought in our area concerns water you know in our area here getting water is not that easy people are need to get money in order for them to get water and other times people lacks money they even like something to eat but getting a blessing of the world of the community will be a much much blessings to our community first of all i want to thank the founders those who are putting in money what you are doing is a great work you don't know what you are doing to our community but for we who are staying here we have seen a great hand of god to provide the clean water uh these people you see behind me they slope down down there very far from here to get water uh to get clean water they are using open spring down there and then if they get this water here it will ease in their body so may the god bless you thank you for coming in i pray that god will bless you and multiply you for that of giving god bless you and now i was thinking that there was a clip there with lori but i i mean i must have had the wrong clip i was thinking there was one here but we'll find that one and play that another time that we get quite a few clips coming in and i'm starting to lose track of those but uh that's it's just amazing what you're doing uh all the wells we've dug i mean april one is here uh i think day after tomorrow and then we start another home three more wells will dig in that village or actually i say those villages because every well so far has been dug in a different village so all the villages are you know they have a long walk and it's hot over there it's really hot so it's an amazing thing but now i want to tell you about something that's just happened now i was i was thinking you would see lori there but mike and laurie who have done this they we have just uh made an agreement a partnership where mike and laurie are going to work with us to get wells doug and some first nations places uh we we we're right now in final talks with uh uh uh one of the tribes one of the nations in the southwest part of the united states i'm not quite ready to announce it yet just because we want to make sure we we're going for it but we're going to start putting wells for the first nations people uh one of the letters i got from them yesterday said that some people have to drive 10 to 15 miles just to get the water to to drive 10 or 15 miles back and you know what gas is doing these days how much expensive just to get water to live off of i had no idea and we asked them you know where was the most need and she they said throw a rock anywhere in this on this reservation i mean these are miles and miles uh wide and across i'm just beginning to learn about it but wherever you throw a rock basically is what they're saying there's a need for will so i hope that's going to get you excited because we'll start bringing you uh videos from native american reservations i'm assuming they're all on reservations if there's anything different we'll tell you but very very excited about it um when lori when i told lori and mike about this just yesterday because we you know i said this is what i want to do and i wonder if you guys can help us and they had just come back from uganda where you just saw the video there and she had been asked to go visit one of her former students that had been in that village so so lori went there and the girl who's like 12 or 13 years old now said i had a dream a word for you and this is the word i saw you helping indians and immediately she didn't know at the time what that referred to she comes back and and this text arrives for me saying i want you to come and help the first nations people and so they knew it was a match so we're going to be showing you lots of wells that we get dug over there and you know the native americans are across our land and most most cities have native american names and uh or many cities have that and streets that are named uh off of the first nations people so we're gonna bless them back they blessed us and we're gonna bless them back so um all right now let's pull up that graphic for the conference in bend and this is coming right up this is it's going to be april 1 on friday april 29 and 30. these are your elijah's dreams prophets you'll see them all hank cunaman kat kerr nathan french and johnny and

register for the conference whether you want to get there in person there's still more room we packed it out last year so don't wait at all i would just urge you to do that so um because it's people you already know i mean it's not some conference it's like your conference so i hope you'll you'll avail yourself of that all right let's bring cat current here hello everybody hey cat good to see you as always i love your your i guess it's red if the camera's got the right it's kind of a red or burgundy i love it that's nice it's got all kinds of colors in it and thank you rose for sending it it's got hot pink but the white doesn't do well with cameras so i try to get a few other colors up but it's i could wrap up in it like a blanket thank you give me rose but people sometimes to get a little bit smaller scarves but this is great i love it it's beautiful yeah i get ties once in a while people will send me a tie and i've got a collection back there you should see the racks of ties i have you have any funny ones yeah i should have worn them because you know i i feel safe wearing a funny one with you and then hank is a cartoonist so i'll wear one of my goofy oh you definitely gotta wear a funny one with hank for sure make him laugh yeah so and then i i i learned something on there because i wore something that had legos of someone said well that's connected with an um impure agenda out there legos and then i wore a different thing apostles and they said that's it that's connected with it i'm not going to say the word another agenda and i thought you know what that i'm done with the enemy stealing god's designs and god's inventions and god's colors you know and you know i do want to make a comment because you name them legos were one of the most brilliant inventions ever and they weren't made by that confused group of people okay they always try to take over something or own a little piece of something so they say that represents them no it doesn't it represents fun now we're not talking about an image that likes belongs to satan we're not talking about satanism or witchcraft okay it's a lego legos are fun for kids all of mine can't play with them and they build things like they could be like church things they could feel anything it's for the creative side of a child which god loves so we're praying for those people yes they're involved with that to break anything off of it if you're not sure just for this is just going to be the first thing out there if you buy something and you're not sure or you hear a comment like that take it whatever it is and say i cleanse this for the kingdom and uh but i would say that legos is a brilliant idea of created by somebody who wanted to give kids a fun way to create yeah and so we're praying over all those confused people that's how god calls them by the way and he does love them you know who we're talking about yes he does they think there's something they're not but this is why it's important for them to know who they are they can't totally fulfill their destiny if they don't know who they are as a man or as a real woman or a man god made one or the other he made us male and female not something else and the enemy does it so he can pull them off the track to he's so afraid of these people that get caught in that because they would become great for god and then they would really bash hell and so you have to understand we always hear one side of something and i'm not agreeing with what what they agree with in any way because i know they're confused they're being somebody they're not really and i know a lot of them that have gotten born again and they know deep in their soul who they were god wrote on your soul if you were male or female before he ever sent you to this earth and i know all these scientists these medical people gonna come up with their own ideas of that but i can tell you god knew who you would be he said i wrote every day of your life in a book that was before he sent you okay so he knows if you're male or female and let me tell you uh if you get born again and change that idea that you have of who you are when you get to having you be happier male or female god make you that way because he needs both of us in the earth to produce children yeah that's good that's good so wow well kat let me just let me then uh i've got my first question ready for you but before i get into my first question uh anything that you want to comment on anything else in the news or anything else and on your heart before we get into that i would just say please join number 45 new social media there you go please join it become a part of that you get all kinds of things sent to you from our number 45 president and i can call him that because he actually is a president i mean he actually is and we know he really is right now so you can't stop saying that i'm not saying anything that isn't true but please join his new social media is changing lives everywhere people are getting excited and that you have contact with him again so other than that and continuation of people jumping off the bandwagon for the left and talking about what's really going on behind some of those closed doors is becoming shocking and at this point i can't name names but it's becoming shocking who is turning their back on the left and then going in and testifying before not the normal committees not before the normal committees or the uh the the um i'm trying to think in my natural mind right now that doesn't work very well or the court or the car yeah there you go there you go yeah the court where are they testifying are they somewhere else other than the court or they are in the court they're not in the normal court at all you all know there's more than one court right talking about the court of heaven they already know the truth anyway yeah but i'm talking about yeah there are things still going on uh collecting evidence people yeah that will be spread everywhere eventually you will see it everywhere names places dates the real thing um when the news have to admit what happened with the 2020 elections and who really is our president so aside from the comedy being put on by the white house every time they ask one of their important leaders uh who don't know what to say and never do say the right thing i think finally the comedians are getting some content from the left i think they kind of drop more a little bit bashing the right it's a lot more exciting and funny to get some of those quotes from the left who've never said anything right and it's more convincing just let them keep talking people because it convinces more democrats to switch sides than anything else going on uh we have the right and the conservative or god you know we may not convince people to change sides but their own leaders these people don't have a brain this country is not going to go anywhere they're right about that one uh but it will be going somewhere really soon and you'll be excited about it so just remember this every time you hear something broadcasted that's so insane like a five-year-old could do it better right i know migraine can run the country better right now but when they open their mouth and say these insane things like they can't even think of a simple thing a question to answer so they say the crazy thing it makes morally sophisticated intelligent democrats to switch sides so they don't they don't have to be you know put in the same box as those crazy people yeah very very good well kat thank you for that i appreciate that yeah these are very interesting times coming up as uh if even now if you watch the patriot channels and i do because i don't watch the mainstream news what does one watch when they don't watch mainstream news i look at patriot channels that love love this country and they have they have things to say and they have what we call citizen journalists instead of asking going on mainstream media looking for actual people who call themselves journalists we actually have real journalists citizen journalists who are there on these places on these sites with these cameras and they put these things on you see things and hear things that you didn't know they're from citizen journalists people that were there you know that's right and so it's really really exciting to do that but i mean i just turn it off i just turn it off and how much there is no secular news channel i ever wrote i did get my information mainly from heaven because they really do know what's going on and and they also know the end they know what's going to happen yeah and so but beside that you hear things like through friends or maybe somebody will send you something as a meme or something is hilarious that's the only reason why i know what some of the left is saying it's not because i actually watch those channels yeah i hear yeah well okay let me my first question i want to ask you kat today is not on my particular list because i've been wanting to ask you i know you're going to have it all the time for anyone that's new you've been to heaven thousands of times many people have a number of people have probably hundreds and hundreds but you know i've known you for years and i've tracked with you and and i know you go all the time almost on a daily basis or probably on a daily basis so i want to ask you you know we haven't asked for a while is there anything you've been seeing that god has shown you about heaven that you've never yet shared that you can think of that something new or anything that he's revealed to you about something that's in heaven or anything else that he told you just i i didn't prepare you for the question so it might be within so much i i don't even know how to start on that but he's always taking me to new places he's always showing me new revelation i'm always seeing people who have gone home to heaven and see what they're doing really one of the reasons why there's always going to be new places in heaven is because of who's coming home because the people coming from the earth everybody has a gift that god made them a gift i'm not not talking about spiritual gifts it's okay fivefold it's okay i'm not throwing that out with about the baby in the bathwater and people don't even know what that means if you're born 90 years ago i still hear my mom say that if someone's heard a little clips gets you know sent out there with my words but um when you were made by god you live before that when you lived in him you were still you you were you you always lived in him you've already been to the beginning and the end and the end of the beginning because you lived in him in the father and uh when he when he sent you he put a gift in you a natural gift you know why it was natural because when you get to heaven you don't use spiritual gifts there's no five-fold ministry in heaven people you're trying to question the laws pray for the sick help people try to understand the word the word is there so what would you do that's why people don't have a clue they think it's boring but you're very wrong because the gift he put in you whether it was you know a bronco rider or an amusement park creator disney made it by the way people you argue with me all you want to i know that his place is going through all kinds of things right now but he didn't make it that way we're going back to the fun thing god created places for fun yeah fun places are in heaven fun places are on the earth and god made those so that we could have a delightful life and to laugh so god put that those gifts in us because you will use that gift you will not actually miss your final uh call on your life because your final call and your final vision god has for your life is to be that gift in heaven that's why there's so many places all over heaven to enjoy things like these because people get to use their gift in heaven it's usually your mansion is built around that gift so every every time he takes me there's somebody new who's arrived there's new places to go to to see to enjoy and that's one of the things that always amazes me that god knows who to send at what time he times your birth on the earth and there's a reason for that he wants you to release something here in the earth create something on the earth that he needs on the earth or just the words he gives you to say it's very important but i i have been to some new places in heaven one i think i mentioned it once was the hall of the heroes and but he keeps taking me there and who you think is a hero on in this world it probably would be someone like a fireman a policeman or somebody in the military but there are what i would call everyday people in heaven's hall of heroes that you don't know or never knew but you find that about them when you get to heaven people who maybe they passed out sandwiches every every week in this one area of town you never knew that they fed people maybe maybe it was ordering you know 500 crystals or i don't even know if they're still around or chick-fil-a's you know and then you take them to this whole area and just pass them like anybody who's hungry you don't ask what they believe or who they are you're feeding people that god highly honors in heaven they would be called a hero in heaven that would be a hero in heaven and so a lot of the people we do recognize as heroes on the earth they are recognized in the hall of heroes but then there's this wonderful place this wonderful part of the hall of heroes which is would be for the everyday person who maybe never had a special position or reached a certain level in their intelligence or maybe an education or was known or they became famous on the earth that doesn't mean uh you will be known in heaven everybody watches you to see the kindness you give really you're praying for a whole group of sunday school children maybe your school teacher and you're imparting into these little kids truths about god and stuff like that that would be a hero in heaven that person in heaven and so i think the holy heroes is you cannot escape being blessed and honored by god in heaven and i know down here we give all the glory to christ but you can't there's no way you can escape being recognized and honored wow by even the slightest simplest thing that you do on his behalf or for him he's going to make sure you get recognized so be prepared when you go there to be quite surprised and delighted when you're taken to the hall of heroes and see who god counts as a hero i want to ask you about that too because you know we're taught yeah we're taught not to take the glory and we don't so in heaven there's rewards everywhere for everyone to see on purpose by god so if you walk up to someone you see their reward you see their massive mansion and you realize the good things that they did and you see the rewards so the couple questions do you do you just say thank you for what you did do you do you praise them for the good works then do they say thank you or do they say oh no all glory goes to god how does that work um he won't let them say in heaven oh no all the glory goes to god because he's already met with him and said this is my way to honor you don't say you're don't never say you're not important in heaven it's okay to receive a blessing from god and i would i would say wow you've got the most amazing blessing from god i'm so thrilled that he honored what you did on the earth and even though i didn't know you on the earth you know i can see that you you really touched the heart of god isn't he awesome okay recognition does go back to god but he wants people to be honored even down here he says show i'll give honor to whom honor is due he says it in the word while we're here on the earth so we're not going to miss being honored in heaven and so the people that are being complimented so they're saying i mean i'm this is a silly question but they're just saying thank you thank you and they're they're they're happy to be thanked for that yeah in other words yeah i mean of course it's an obvious question but i mean we are so trained to give the glory to god and stay humble that it's like it's it's really that's almost if it was on earth it'd be hard to train people with that because they would be so sure that they were not supposed to receive praise for that but yeah okay oh so i have another question you talked about five minutes ago and um in heaven and there's all these fun things in the in the amusement park theme parks whatever we call it okay so this question came up before it's like if somebody let's say after the cross and there were no cars there were no vehicles there are no phones there's no technology as we know it today and someone right after the cross dies and uh is transported to heaven i mean right after christ is ascended and all that they go right there and they see all the amusement parks and all the cars and all the trans all of that right away they're not walking around the robes because we haven't got there yet oh they uh they get to go to the welcome center in heaven and um which i laughed the first time um jesus told me about the welcome center but i could totally see why it's needed especially people if they were stuck in a certain denomination where they thought nobody should have music oh wow they didn't like dance even as a form of worship because people are dancing all over the streets in heaven and there's music everywhere you know i i think they probably need to go to the welcome center they'd like to know this is really heaven this isn't the other side has always had music they've always had uh people dancing delightfully or or fiercely in worship they do a lot of the jump type dances i don't even know what they call like where you just stand and jump up and down in celebration it gets so exciting to be a part of that in heaven so yeah i think that would be one way to explain people who thought there'd never be any fun in heaven when you go to heaven you begin to think more like a child than you ever did in your life you were uh let's just say you were a professor at one of the biggest universities you knew jesus christ you knew he died for your sins and you received him but you thought heaven would be more of an intellectual place we'd get really high intellect you know to maybe be more like god well you do become more like him but he likes to have fun he we were little children on the inside of him and it says you must be like a little child to enter into the kingdom of heaven that's your faith that your trespass also your joy and your desire to have fun and so the devil doesn't want anyone to have fun right now he thinks that he's got everybody by crushing them and keeping them oppressed fun really is does something in your soul that begins to connect you with god himself with the father himself and you think more like a child so it's not like maybe for the first little bit of time that you're there you're kind of quite surprised and and you're filled with wonder uh but then you realize this is really what it's like i enjoy this you're getting it with joy and then you begin to release joy because you've got so much of it in you uh almost everything you experience in heaven it'll it'll wash over on other people near you in heaven they'll begin to laugh or they'll begin to cheer is there a sense where even for a moment in time uh someone who spent their whole life with restrictions is there a moment in time in heaven where they where you suddenly go what was i thinking when you see it or is it not is it so fleeting what have you seen any of that i'm quite sure there are people who absolutely say that why did i not understand that he could be fun why did i not think yeah it could be the most heaven she'd be the most exciting amazing place in existence and right now it is yeah but we're gonna we will end up with more of that on the earth after this whole thing you know this platform is cleaned off and god starts doing what he's got planned for right now uh but i know quite a bit that people will stand there and just stay with their mouth open on the streets of gold like they're really gold i think they really are they're really gold then they get down on they get down they want to touch it's about gold streets like this this is really real the the bible was right it's really real i think it begins to tie them more and more they see the word in a way they never thought as being real you know uh people a lot of a lot of people like to say the word is symbolic of things but it really literally means what it says especially when it talks about heaven and i know some some people i think are more amazed over the size of mansions thinking you know you're happy with a little cabin somewhere in paradise yeah hey if your cabin is going to be inside your mansion people because this is god's way to bless you and to provide a place for you he provides this place for you in heaven it's not going to be small or cheap by any means and yes he wants to delight your heart it even says in the bible he'll give you the desires of your heart but even heaven is way beyond anything you could have thought of or imagined sure we're not god never will be him but we are his sons and daughters and like any good father they're going to provide something amazing for their own children as a father on the earth so if you imagine the one who's made everything and time came from him he's not somewhere in time it comes from him that's just a that's a bizarre concept okay mr peter i think that was the one thing that i knew the minute i saw him that time came from him and he will use time for a while then he won't need it anymore he won't need time yeah just like this is i can't imagine without the passage of time but i want to ask you a question about on the other side of it so i'm on one question was what do you think of when you go there and you go what was i thinking with all my restrictions so i want to know the other side what does god think like okay 25 years ago i went to these were lovely people so i'm not criticizing i i went to a wedding i was invited to the wedding and they didn't tell me anything so i showed up in my a sport coat and a tie shirt and tie and dressed up my wife and kids all we were all there well they didn't have any music there was no jewelry every all the women's the buns on top the one there was a simple whitish colored dress just very simple and the men all had white shirts but no tie normal it almost looked like work pants because there all this effort was put into not showing off not being on display so i for by default i thought they're completely on display that's all i can think about here but that was their restrictions that's what they believed in their heart that god wanted so god's looking at these people god loves those people what's he thinking generation after generation when people what this have you seen that side of god where he would talk about it he's thinking how much fun will i have when they get here and they begin to realize that they live below what he wanted them to live okay way below what he would would want us to live the word says number one that christ became poor that we might be rich that's rich with wealth but that's also rich in joy rich in creativity rich and you know he doesn't want to take everything away from you uh being poor and looking poor is not holy i think that might be the point they think if i wear too much or i look different people will think i'm not holy holy on the inside of you holy is how you choose to live no sin no darkness okay no deception in you no doom and gloom in you holy is being like god it says be holy as he is holy so it's not impossible to be there you just don't have any darkness in you you receive christ the light of life is in you joy and hope is coming from you uh you you don't partake of anything of the enemy it says to resist the devil and he'll flee from you so you can't tell me that's not possible it says in the word it is and pretty soon the devil will stop looking for you because he doesn't want to get beat up with your words or your worship to christ and so we tend to think uh there's just going to be a point where there's too much i shouldn't have a lot there's nowhere in there look at the splendor haven't he displayed with solomon ryan because he obeyed god solomon obeyed he did what god asked him to do so did david uh you cannot you can't escape being blessed if you let him bless you if there's nothing wrong in having money you can't have it have control you i know my dad used to say you know god sends it he spends it that's why i say that a lot which is true whatever god sends me or people send me i allow god to do it with any way he wants to but he doesn't want me to live in a hovel he does not want me to live a poor or lacking in any way whatsoever heaven is that's not heaven on earth as it is in heaven means you have more than enough to bless other people to help build cities to help send the truth around the world that's that's who god is that's what he wants and i'm going to take you back to the word glory you mentioned in the beginning yeah we tend to say i'll give you all i give all the glory back to you but he actually wants you to carry it really okay christ in you the hope of glory that's not that's not christ saying i hope you i hope you have a lot of glory for me that's not what that is christ in you he's hoping that you recognize that when you create that for him you get to carry it and then release it it's something you will release okay glory is very powerful it's the light of god the power of god is what the glory is people think it's all about just worship well even worshiping god creates glory but when you create it by the way you live your life it begins to build on the inside of you where's christ in you christ is a hope of glory i want to bring another a point about the glory for all have sinned how have they sinned fell short of the glory come short of the glory and yet christ in you is the hope of glory if you put those together you meditate on that you might be able to get a little bit of understanding he wants you to display the glory that builds in you to that he created christ in you is the hope that you will create glory and then use the glory for him is something you use for him it's okay i give you i used to do that all the time at the end of my meetings i gave you all the glory he said you've already given it to me by allowing me to use you oh wow you surrender to me and allow me to use you to to tell truth and revelation about me the father the holy spirit about heaven about time he said that that is giving it to me interesting now he he said uh-huh well he said in the word okay i want to ask you this the before and after before old testament at least he says i will share my glory with no one no man no one and then the new is it that in the new testament that's when he starts sharing his glory okay it's all about jesus christ that's why christ in you what what is different than the old testament christ is in you that's the difference the price he paid he there's so many reasons why he died for us and people say well yeah our sins there's so much more than just sins being forgiven people are you kidding the risen lord who made everything that ever existed he made it with his father why did he do that why did he die why did he go through so much and then it was finished for salvation at the cross but if he was done at that moment he'd have gone home to heaven there was more he had to do for the power and for the glory he he had to go into abraham's muslim he had to preach the gospel to all those who god counted as righteous because they believed in him yeah he wanted them to know who their savior was who the messiah was all those who were waiting all that time and faithful to that belief he wanted them to know here he is here he is and yet even in some of those had created glory but they didn't have the ability back in the old testament to carry it because he didn't live in them so everything changed everything changed when christ was born in the earth when he took the cross and when he when he took all your sins evil wickedness hate everything that was evil or wicked or murder or everything that was defiling that was put on the cross with him that's why he died on the cross he didn't die on the cross just so his body can hang there it's what he carried what he took in the garden in his own being that had to be crucified or he could not forgive sins yeah but it's also why he's the only one who can forgive sins why so you can create glory carry the glory and release the power in the light of god throughout the earth the understanding the knowing and the understanding of the glory that's the use of it that's the release of it will cover the earth like the waters cover the sea it is in the word people don't have revelation on that yeah yeah um you know it talks about uh oh boy i'm gonna lose this train of thought let me just see if i can grab it oh yeah okay so we're we are joint heirs with christ and then there's scriptures that say everything and jesus said everything is mine i give to you and everything that the father has given to me and everything i have i give to you we own we we're supposed to be if we're joint heirs that means whatever he inherited we inherit what about that have we not grasped that we are supposed to get on this side of heaven are we are we not grabbing hold of what we are i think the biggest thing that most of the body i'm only talking about believers right now not those who don't know him they need to know him and i think what we will have a mass of people running into the kingdom but those who already belong to jesus christ i think they are not grasping the power part okay the dominion part okay but christ talked about it he talked about the gospel of the kingdom well it wasn't just the gospel the gospel message the gospel is about being born again but the kingdom that he never stopped talking about was the ruling part the dominion and authority over darkness wow even to the point of creating things not people or plants or stuff like that but the creative ability we have people aren't grasping they're not grasping that you are kings a king a spiritual king has more authority in the earth than one little tiny demon does anywhere and yet we aren't using it yeah yeah i'm i'm seeing a picture while you're talking i'm getting this picture going through my head of all god's people and we're dressed up as policemen we've got this authority and firemen and military people we've got this kind of spiritual authority and we're going lord i don't know what to do i don't you know i know i'm supposed to understand that i have authority in you but i've got nothing and he's seeing people in uniform i don't know that's the picture that's in my head so i don't know you're right they don't really know who they are which is the whole point of spirit force that he's having begin to mentor people the first thing i talk about in spirit force is who are you as as someone who has received jesus christ who are you yeah and then i start talking about who they really are them to be who they are what is our purpose on the earth it's not just to be happy win a few souls and then die and go home to heaven is so much greater than that so much and i think the other thing they're not grasping for sure not grasping is what is the spirit realm what how why do we have to talk about the spirit realm why do we need to know about the unseen realm it's where your power is displayed and where it's released the whole christ in you the hope of glory that glory you can't see it or touch it with your hands but it's there and christ is hoping you will understand and learn that you need to do something with that i mean baptism and fire is is is not happened yet people had measures of it when that happens no one will have to say did i get baptized in fire you will know and you will feel you'll know this what happened that brings boldness to you but the glory is a whole different thing the glory and the fire are two different things and i think not understanding what he gave us when he died for us when he said we're joint heirs what he operated in we can operate in yeah we have a story over here an authority over but christ himself was not poor yeah and i i mean i saw baptism because we were all trained up in this i was a child of the 50s 60s but when i got baptized it was like fire insurance i i now was going to go to heaven and then i was going to try and live a good life to make sure i didn't you know burn my ticket but i was going to but i down you know i got baptized he was you know but that's a t-shirt that's a t-shirt uh don't burn your ticket that's a good one there's a marketing tip right there that one just popped in my head never used that before but i mean but i mean you know that's the way we are we just it was fire insurance we didn't want to right you know and if a certain preacher scared you scared the hell out of you then you would say okay i don't want to burn so i'll return and then you accept it you baptized that's why people got saved you get every week yeah the generations passed they got saved every week to make it for the ones well every now and then they'll think about it no we got saved every week we're at the altar every single week repeating what we've already done yeah we get that growing and going forward and conquering things yeah spirit oh pushing back darkness crushing the plans of the enemy i'm talking about the spiritual enemy uh a pastor is supposed to train you to do the work of the ministry which is operating in power and authority and dominion and everybody thinks we're all supposed to be evangelists and every day the way you live your life you should live as a witness to want people that would want them to know god but but we didn't go any further i'm you know i'm going on you know natural natural years i'm in my 60s right now i don't even think that i i think timeless and people should think well i'm here this time part of my life and when it gets to this age i can't do this anymore no you should keep going conquering over darkness the whole time you're on the earth until he takes you home so his purpose was to get us born again and then begin to operate in the kingdom which is where the power the glory and the dominion will be dispersed and used in the earth and i think that's probably the the one number one thing is they don't know what they have yeah we don't know what he gave them and so what they knew from 100 years ago 200 300 400 500 years ago they're kind of stuck in this rut of yes and then you know i love what mario marilla does that's his call on his life that's what god called him to to bring revival and to do that that's the thing i'm a prophet i have to say what god says and in these days which is not the end it's only the beginning of the power of god being displayed through us okay the first wave in heaven the second wave of power being shown was in hell wiping up how the third wave is us on the earth displaying in power and authority operating as kings lords and priests spiritual levels of dominion and authority is what we don't know how to do good so good cat yeah i mean i could talk you and i could sit here and talk a long time about how we were raised i remember when i did get baptized i was serious i mean i i really wanted to know god i always had a desire to know god but my thinking about the god that i didn't know until late in my 20s i didn't really get to know him is that i i remember i was 10 years old and then we had a potluck after church and mom said one dessert well you know there was very busy and i got went got back a second dessert knowing i was disobeying my mom and i felt like dirty slime because that was our understanding of god if you disobeyed him it's like you know i'm so ashamed of you like you know like a parent might say he's not a very good parent and i grew up in that but anyway there was so a million miles away from the authority uh i want to ask a question about because i want to make sure people don't think i'm any way um dissing people that have restrictions that they serve the lord the best they know how um and elmer had a it was taken around the earth it's our first book called transported by the lion of judah yeah and he took her on the lion on the line himself and he flew her all over the earth and they'd stop at various churches and there was this one gathering i i pictured in outdoors it may have been indoors i don't know but it was very dry what you would think it was an old-timey dry no power it didn't seem like there was any power but they were trying to pray and they were praying the best they knew how and what the lord showed her at each place was and what he showed her here was these are some of my favorite people on the earth because they're no matter what life is thrown at them i'm just paraphrasing from memory they're still seeking me so i mean that i mean if you were there as a seer you would have seen the activities of heaven i suppose in that dry place yeah the i mean the the angels were still there i'm sure the spirit of god even if they didn't have holy spirit on the inside he would have been right there next to them leading guiding the best he can and they did because their heart it's where their heart was it's always where your heart is yeah yeah they were doing in that time in society or in in the earth what was going on in the world they didn't abandon christ they didn't abandon him they still honored him they still loved him and they still sought him and seeking him is one of the most important things you can do i think sometimes people maybe get caught up in them it's okay to have fun but you can't you can't forget the awe of god and the wonder of god and who he is and i am undone every single time i'm with the father and with the son or even completely undone really these who have made everything uh sought me to speak with me and to give me a commission i'm totally undone you know i'm always thinking i i have a 12th grade education you know i don't i don't have wisdom in the earth and god said for you you don't need wisdom in the earth and he's and i said you know i don't have a lot and he said but you're going to have unlimited one day you need to prepare your heart for that because you're generous you're kind and he said and you love me you love me you love my son you love holy spirit you love the word of god you honor your mom your mother and your father he said you are you're so kind you're perfect for what we want you to do you love people and he said us that's the greatest thing you can offer and you've offered it's in extravagance what i have given to you in the earth's eyes it might not be much but to us it is tremendous that there is someone on the earth who wants to be with us who wants to seek us who wants to know us and it's wonderful to seek him but why are you seeking him just for him to know him to be with him uh is is a delight to the father son and holy spirit that people really want to know them and i think that means so much to god that's what those people were doing in those simple meetings they wanted to know him yeah and what they knew what they had at that time in in in any amount of revelation they were running after that yeah that's why god would send waves of things to the earth you know when when the healing thing came it changed people forever when the holy spirit came the reason that changed people forever and now we're we're going to have the glory and then after that the fire and then then the power of god is about to hit this earth through us we are his sons and his daughters he wants us to display who we are in him because of him and with him that's what his purpose is he doesn't he doesn't have to look at your education or your position or what you have right now it's where is your heart is your heart to help to love uh are you are you having conversations with him about that yeah and people would go well i need to pray that is prayers conversation yeah you know the you you said that before cat you said that before and i don't want people to miss that because i've gone over that i've been times when i'm praying and i'm thinking lord i don't know how to pray and then i then would pop into my head cat said prayer is just conversation with god and oh okay i got this hey lord how are you doing today you know have you seen you know and it and prayer kicks in conversation kicks in right it's not we think of these people who are on their face which is fine right it is what that's what they know to do and their heart is to do the best at what they know that's that's what they have uh i would encourage anyone and i know i i am still an intercessor i intercede but i have conversation all day long and all night long and i talk about deep things with the father but i talk about just simple things with him too as i am his daughter number one i'm his daughter number one you're his son and daughter before you're anything else you know what we try to achieve in the earth what's important in the earth is what are you doing with your life um and yes you want to be with them and talk to them but outside what are you doing outside what are you displaying outside the love of god the life of god the hope of god uh the power of god or you're sharing that kind of truth about him yes it's important to share the gospel always but but add some excitement into that you know you need christ you need to know you don't want to miss your destiny what did he make me what do you love to do are you a baker is that what you dream about and have passion about you know he put that in you that's that's okay to run after that he gave me that then you touch people where they are right now and you get them excited about who he made them to be that wasn't just by coincidence you decided you couldn't stop talking about boats you want to run one you want to take people on one you want to design them and build them that's the creator that god put that in you um we were talking something you said i don't know just click this in but um i'm seeing like people watching right now and a lot of them there's not someone leading them to the lord and maybe they've received them they don't know but their sense is like my father if he wasn't angry he'd be disappointed which was almost worse and he'd say i am so disappointed in you so there's people going god is so disappointed at the things i've done i just can't i can't attain what would you say to those people with what you know about god's love i would say if you had a little child let's say three or four and they make mistakes probably all day long and do you do you punish them for that you punish them because they're still in a learning place uh they they love you they want to hug you on dudes but maybe they haven't learned really what they should do what they shouldn't do he's not going to abandon you his hope is for you he desires great things it says in the bible that his hope is for you he's not against you that's the main thing in the word and i know people probably told you well you just went too far now that was the devil the devil always try to make you feel less than or unworthy that is not god god is not wanting you to feel unworthy if you aren't worthy his son would not have died for you okay that that was done while yet you were sinners he died because of the love the father has for you and and christ has that love because his father has that love for you go to him quickly and say i'm so sorry i did that i'm so sorry i said that what what can i do that would blush you you know say things like that you would be surprised what would come into your heart what kind of doors would open for you if you if you ask those kinds of things of them you have not because you ask not and people always say well i i can't pay my rent because i haven't asked for help you it's okay to ask for that help but you need to go beyond that what about being creative what about the gift he put in you what about opportunities to use it ask him to open those doors you're building a relationship just like any earthly father or mother who loved their child would build a relation for you yeah you get correction but then he gives you love and he gives you instruction and direction god's not leaving anyone and he said i will treat anyone who's born again like a child and that this is how i will work with them i love them but i don't love them if i don't bring correction but when i bring correction i always bring direction so love correction and direction is how god works with us because you make a mistake he's not kicking you to the curb and saying you're not worth anything that's the devil's thing yeah you're going to build a relationship uh being a christian is all about relationships yeah you know you just said that church you belong to or don't belong to it's your relationship with him christ made a way why did he die to take us back to the father in relationship people that his greatest desire is to have that relationship and for you to know him in that way that doesn't mean you can willfully sin all the time and think you'll get away with it what that means is you're never gonna do anything for god spending all the time is what keeps you from growing things from god yeah but knowing that he wants to know you and his greatest desire is to see you become something that helps people that that creates things for people that brings love and kindness to people and and he does love everybody yeah but everybody isn't going to go to heaven that's that's that's that is a myth okay receiving jesus christ who is the only one who can wipe away your sins like you've never sinned and by the way let me mention this please do not keep reminding of god of the sins you were forgiven for he already forgot them right you're wasting your time yeah maybe you had a simple past you know if he didn't put you on a platform to share that to get people to know god does things with people who mess things up okay yeah that's all he has to work that's all he has to work with right you know what you're doing really you're marketing hell yeah if you do nothing but talk about your past sins you will live in the past and never go into your future because that's all that's in you what's in you is coming out if all you can talk about is all the sins that you were already forgiven for that's called wasteful words because to god the sins are gone like they never happen how about talking about the glory or hope for people or god's not done with people yet he's not done with you he has more for you no matter who's listening but but his heart is for you he carried you before you were sent here he wants you to come back to him that's why christ died to make a way back to the father you know we've said lately uh you may have been on these one when we talked about whatever right now whatever the mainstream media blasts uh as truth and johnny will pull and i will point this out you know that the opposite of everything they're saying is the real truth yeah so i like when my dad was under the influence of the devil he would say get out of my sight i don't want to look at your face so the absolute opposite is true about god yeah god says you've sinned and you've messed up come here i want to look you in the face and tell you it's going to be okay and help you restore you right it's the opposite it is the opposite it's the absolute opposite and the devil's really good at lying he is a father of lies so most of the time when you hear things that that aren't nice or aren't good or aren't happy that don't bring life or hope or a chance for a future most of that stuff you hear is from the devil even if it's the fake news saying it or people who are angry people get really angry they spew on everybody around them uh most people who are have are filled with fear believe it or not fear causes you to lash out it's unfounded fear and or anger makes you lash out of innocent people and the devil will make sure the innocent get bashed because he doesn't want them to grow up with any hope or worthiness and yet you look and see what christ offered this world and everyone out there if you're sinning you're marketing hell helping hell when the son of god came and died and didn't have to gave up everything to live on this earth went into hell wasted hell on the third day took back the power and authority that god gave adam who gave that away to the enemy don't partner with hell or darkness you're hurting yourself and the future generations coming up from you why not begin to act like god does he forgives he brings hope he inspires he empowers that's who he is he is not the evil wicked god and he does not send people to hell they choose to go there to excuse the beautiful awesome sacrifice that christ did so you can go to heaven with no sin no quickness no evil because if god let everybody come to heaven heaven would be like the earth and it's not it's filled with glory splendor wonder fun excitement creativity but on earth as it is in heaven is how god wants us to live like we already have that we become that for him in this earth god's not bashing you he's not hating you and he's not ignoring you you're yelling so loud for the enemy you can't hear him speaking that's huge cat what you just said you're like you're yelling so loud for the enemy just rehearsing their stuff rehearsing their fault rehearsing how god's probably fed up with me you know i used to think that i must be a hard case for god as if that could happen by anybody you know but i mean yeah cat you had said a few minutes ago and this is surprised me you said when you go to heaven you're undone every time do you mean every time i am and you are no i go like i'm a little i'm a little girl but in my heart in my heart which is my soul every time it says heart in the bible is talking about your soul people soul is the heart of your being he's not talking about your human heart guard your heart that's your soul for out of all the way you live your life as it taketh in his soul so is he right so your soul your mind your will and emotions my soul is undone because in my spirit man i go in my spirit my soul is in me my soul is undone by how how excited god is to to to see how i respond to him to see how much i love him and i couldn't wait to obey maybe you should say god i want to get to the place where i can't wait to obey what you say that's good you know what happens obey obedience becomes like breathing like breathing is the most normal thing that you would choose there's this there's no even consideration of darkness in you it's there's no darkness in you christ jesus said there's none of him in me he was talking about satan that's why he had no power over him there was no darkness in christ there was none of him in him he was filled with the father the love and the life of the father and let me tell you a human can be that way really wow because i am i am i am that way all the time ask anybody i'm happy i love people i don't care what color your skin is guess what you you're you're still going to be you in heaven every tongue tribe and nation whether people don't like you or not god loves you he made you the way he loves the color of your skin he gave you that color of your skin that's so good yeah and you you and i mentioned this recently with you on the program there i have seen that in you that um you don't you know jesus talked about nathanael a man in whom is no guile you strike you come off you are a person in whom there's no guile you don't have an agenda you don't have an attitude i'm not you know here we're not trying to over worry about giving you glory i'm not trying i'm doing that i'm i'm i'm a i was like middle of class graduating you know i was like middle of everything i there was no place i ever excelled in my personal life as a person but i always had a desire to know god and of course my father and my grandmother who were lived holy uh were good examples to me but i knew people who have wonderful children who who didn't have the best parents when they realized god really is their true father and how much he loves us i understand more and more the sacrifice christ made and why would i want to do anything the fear of the lord is not being afraid of him yeah yeah being afraid you will be less or love him less than you should the fear is you don't want to hurt the heart of the lord it's not like you don't want to you know you're so afraid of him that he might hit you or smack you people use that scripture for that that's not what that means but in saying the same thing i will tell you something new god's showing me the father is the terror of god that is god himself the terror of god usually comes against extremely wicked evil really really evil wicked people who have sowed themselves to the enemy he has small toleration for them who has wiped christ out of their life will never want him have no desire who evil are wickedly hurting maiming killing people the the terror of god is about to consume some of those people i remember prophet walking up to me one time i was just out in the glory on the floor he goes a god will give you he will tell you what to say to men about the terror you would tell them about the terror of god these wicked people and uh and i can tell you that's something that hasn't really been quite released yet but there's a whole camp of wicked evil that is so deep and wicked they're about to experience ways of the terror yeah coming up at the time before i get too far from this one thing you're making a point i want to make sure we we get it all in there as i'm watching you even on camera right now you you talking about you're undone by god and when i can i just make an observation you're undone by who he used you're undone you you're undone that he that the education you didn't have was no impediment that the talent you didn't have i mean that's what i'm getting from you have you always felt that way um i'm i'm i it didn't stop me from running after him yeah it says to seek for christ with all of your heart your mind and your soul seek for him that's a continual what are you thinking today of knowing christ that would have been even though i had to i had to live a normal life people i had children i have a husband i had i've worked uh for a good part of my life in the business world and and yet i still with the passion i had to know him i found time in the middle of the night to after him and he shook up one day he showed up he's so real he's so real but i'm undone by the love that i'm before the throne and because there's no nothing in me of the enemy there's no darkness in me i've i've heard of some people who weren't living right caught up that they they almost want to scream from the glory and the passion they were feeling they they felt like they knew they weren't living right but he never has said anything to me i am so like a little child i can't wait to be with him i am i'm undone by the waves of love that consume they go through my entire being and i'm living in love that's what it's like to to be in heaven yeah i've heard of people he sent back they cried because yeah they wanted to be with him and and that's what we should always go after him for for that reason and can't you know i i think we've known each other either eight or nine years somewhere in there and when you first began to preach that you were doing it publicly we were on the cruises where i first met you in person it was your cruise and we hadn't maybe officially met quite yet i don't know but you were talking about that you could live without sinning and i thought that's not possible really i didn't and i and it was a struggle through the years but more and more i'm coming you know to the realization that most of these things are a choice we choose to sin we just choose to sin and instead of saying uh i used to pray god help me not do these things so much and it's not that i heard the lord speak but it would be as if he said well why don't you just not do those things so much i mean there are things that really are a choice and i'm learning that more and more but you had to keep saying that like nathaniel like you're saying you i mean you're the first person that's said that but i watched your life you can get to the point where you're not you're not ill-willed towards mankind i mean you're not very merciful towards wickedness and that's that's good that's that's the no guile part too but anyway i you so you're saying you don't have to live a life of sin you don't have to go through a day and say lord forgive me for what i sin today right you don't pray that's right that's right he actually said to me one time it tell he believers to stop crowding up the altars that's for sinners that's that's for the lost okay if you're born again you shouldn't want to be running down there every sunday to get faith again people run down there to step into the glory i don't care what they're having you know what's called saying i'm going down to get the glory i'm going down to get the presence of god you can you can get the more of him i think is probably what what is what pulls me that way is i've had a taste of him i've had an experience with him and and it pulls me more towards him and you can have that because instead of saying god help me not to sin today how about you getting up in the morning and say i refuse to sin today that's good that's pretty powerful you you command your own day you do it from the time your eyes open start recognizing father like this morning i woke up and said father i love you jesus christ my king and my savior i love you holy spirit my best friend i love you i love being with you i i love listening to your words that you speak to me i love knowing you and then i start saying i'm not going to tolerate evil around me i won't tolerate unkindness i will not tolerate injustice you have to not tolerate and i remember one time specifically even after knowing him for years the father walked through my room and touched me said i no longer want to see you participate with the enemy and i don't want you to tolerate the enemy anymore that was a whole new thing to me a whole new thing participating with the enemy is talking more about him and then talking about god you're advertising or marketing hell if all you can talk about is that now i did talk about coming against evil and wickedness over the power of the enemy but i was talking about things going on you know oh well you know this shouldn't be happening to this person or that or that he told me to stop doing it stop doing that and he said and you don't tolerate any attacks of the enemy you don't tolerate any actions of the enemy don't tolerate any of the words he tries to give you that's a whole new level people number one you're not participating so stop participating by complaining right stop complaining whether you stop gossiping you're participating with how marketing how when you do those things i wasn't gossiping i was just fed up with things going on against people who shouldn't be attacked instead of a ship then they're taking authority and sending the host to do something about it so you look at your life do you complain all the time are you angry all the time are you god sitting all the time or you're certainly not as a believer bringing glory to god to god by doing that but you are actually participating so get up in the morning and say i know we'll no longer tolerate the worthy enemy in my life i will not sin i'm going for sin free i know i can have it i'm going after that in jesus name you would be so shocked at the help you get from holy spirit yeah it sounds like you've almost made a when you talk about the joy made up you made a declaration where you dare to declare decree it will be established it will be established as something you build on but at least get up and say something don't get up and start chewing on people maybe you should ask for grace for abundant life when you open your eyes i've been doing that yeah i left that part out so i say hello father son of holy spirit and then they say father i ask for and receive grace for this day that is abundant life grace that's not grace eternal i've already got that and i feel electricity filling me filling me with grace for abundant life and i go out and i'm happy i'm nice to people it's automatic you've got part of heaven in you and any believer author can say father i ask for and receive grace for abundant life this day christ i come to bring a life and bring it abundantly we we it's in the word so i'm just doing the word by saying that you know every day every 24 hours when when when um if you remember when paul was struggling with all the things in his life and christ said that he gives us grace he can give you grace for the day for the evil thereof that's what the word says and you know what paul learned to ask for that grace he learned through the whole word says look my grace i've given to you my peace i've given to you he talked about that grace well he can't give people grace for eternal life but grace for abundant life is one of the reasons if you're not living abundantly you're not asking for it yeah that's really really good um and one i wanted to ask this one question and then we'll wrap up with this but i don't know if you use the word game or if i just thought in my head i can't remember but it's almost like you're uh maybe before you you're at a point now where it's not much of a problem to send it's probably no problem at all but i mean people that are striving for it it almost sounds like they make a game out of getting through a day without sinning if they make an intentionality is that a good goal lord i want to get through the day and i don't want to be sinning at all is that a goal i think it has to be something that you desire yourself instead of begging god to help you not to do it you need to start saying i'm not going to do it okay because you know what happens those words you just spoke will start to come against any sin you have stored and the thing with this the more you sin the more it goes in your soul within your soul you will choose you're going to do again and i've used this as an example that's why prisoners go back to prison and why do they keep committing the crimes it's what's in them they commit the crime it's in their soul they get out that pulls on them they go do it again it's a vicious cycle why not turn that around and instead you plant good things in your soul i choose as an act to my will i bind to my soul god's goodness his authority his will his way i choose life i choose joy i choose obedience you are laying a platform in your soul for the first time that sin will have a much harder time trying to get to you and if sin is presented to you when the when the thought comes to sin that's the devil you say no i don't have that anymore i'm not living that way anymore it has to come from your mouth you're making a declaration of how you want to live instead of letting the devil influence you and suck you into the life you want you to have good good well kat if you feel so loud you want to pray for the people to kind of wrap this up whatever god gives you awesome so father i just declare over everybody listening to this or watching this god that they will want your will your way more than anything else father i just right now impart the life of god the love of god his will his way his excitement his expectation over you his plans over you his desire to know you let it permeate every single person father and i release the anointing that destroys the yoke of darkness of a lifestyle of sin let it be destroyed in jesus name and instead i impart the life of god and the light to flood their soul to show them the right way to live i thank you holy spirit for coming to to pull them into him yes lord let them have a taste of his presence in jesus name you be free stay free and be dangerous against hell every day of your life by being kind by doing what's right because when you learn the joy of obedience you then step into extravagance of god amen amen amen thank you so much i always like to have you tell people how to get a hold of your two websites revealingheaven.com is on the screen what can people get there um they can have uh we have our store there our products our event schedule is there and and then cur.com has a it's a spiritual platform for god to say whatever he wants to say and there's all kinds of training videos on there and learn how to ask for the grace for abundant life i just talked about and and by the way you should search out a scripture in the word that says as a child god filled his son with his grace where's that which where's that one i'm not telling you go find it [Laughter] okay i'm not telling you there is a scripture that the father is saying i filled my son with my grace while he was a child that is grace for abundant life that is why why can christ bring life more abundantly his father filled him with that grace christ you need to get saved people okay he didn't have to fill him with grace for eternal life he filled jesus christ as a child with grace for abundant life and he walked in that abundant life grace his entire life that's good now you also have catker.com tell people about that one catker i forgot what i was saying yeah no uh well yeah so no you're doing it.com yeah.com is where you can watch all kinds of tutorial videos and and hear testimonies and interviews and it is the only place i'm playing the earth that you can give to me online there's no other way to do that and it's called the go to category.com click on the treasury and you can give whenever you want to or you can become a member of the guardian zone who are my friends those are my regular supporters and i bless them i pray for god to increase them a thousand-fold return that's not just baiting you to become one that's just saying i have a relationship with the people who support me and support heaven's plan to reveal heaven on the earth i'm very grateful and by the way why not try a whole day just being grateful you will bless the heart of god that's good very very good cat blessings to you and your team give our love to your team we see jen every morning to start and i actually have some everybody say hi oh that's a big ground oh that's a good well that yeah i hope i will support that because that costs a lot of um money to support those groups just plain and simple so i don't know doesn't i tell i try to explain to people all the time you know the church gets bashed more than any anything else about money okay okay they know the one who makes money who money came from wealth comes from god christ died and we might be rich okay wealth is in heaven if you want to be poor maybe you should rethink going there no i'm joking but heaven is extravagant and all that they have or they give you we can be extravagant if we have wealth it's i would look at wealth as a way to help to grow people to rescue uh that's what wealth is to me when i get money i get so excited because it means i can help somebody or i can give somewhere or do something with it if you look at it that way he'll give you unlimited that's so good yeah these days i'm looking at wealth uh you know as you know as people support i go i can deal i can drill three more wells this month and i can go in there yeah i mean you know you're getting places when when that's where it takes you instead of like going to buy a car or something like that that's that one you can have a good car yeah it is right and i don't mean yeah but i'm just saying i've had fun getting to the place where it's really jazzy fun to start isn't it when i get when i when jen says these these chokes came and i go yeah yeah my soul gets excited because i can help and i can give and that is that's that was the way my father was my grandmother was and so but i love i love to give yeah and uh it is the greatest thing to to consider others more highly than yourself and i god doesn't have a problem with me buying clothes i'm for the first time going to own a home instead of living in our office and then and then our plan we will have an office building so we are going towards expanding in many ways and and guess what it does cost money and we know the one who has all of it but he does love to use people so they will get blessed and be a part of something and while you're at it make sure you give something to elijah's dreams because if it wasn't for steve i wouldn't be here right now i think this is week almost week 70 almost crazy it's way up there he had bringing this non-stop for all of these weeks that was god's plan we just said yes and so remember why you get blessed make sure you've given help oh thank you if you're part of a church and your pastor is still blessing you and a part of your life make sure you're blessing him that's good very very good all right cat another show is over it's almost sad because this is what this one with you goes faster for me than any of the others because i'm just i'm just i'm sucked into it in a good way all right well thank you everybody tomorrow is mike thompson uh at 11 o'clock pacific time thank you everybody we will see you then 

WEDNESDAYS WITH KAT AND STEVE - Episode 71 - Heaven 101!

hey well happy wednesday april 6 already 2022 i'm steve schultz welcome to the broadcast you are you are on elijah streams and we have elijah list.com on the screen because that's where you sign up for the list so that we can keep you informed after the show today and every day we have a show uh within an hour or two we will send you the broadcast by email with the links the description the photos everything so be sure you're on elijah list.com but you are watching elijah's streams we are in year 25 of bringing the voice of the prophets to you between the two lists and of course beyond that you have we have all the other social media but uh and again anyway welcome to the broadcast now i have a very important announcement to make uh and i'm gonna in a minute i'm going to call for the scripture but we always have every single time we do a show or something on the elijah's we will have some who believe this is the word of the lord and some who believe it's not the word of the lord and what i want to kind of drill into us is that that's exactly the way it's supposed to be we're to decide for ourselves if it's a word from the lord or not now yesterday we had an unprecedented number of polarized views some people loved it they said i just want to know tell me the hard stuff so i can prepare and of course a lot of these people have maybe have money and things like that so that they can prepare and then there's people that wrote and said how am i supposed to get ready i don't have any money i'm 70 years old i live little and all of that we had a lot of people more way way way more than normal that said that they they saw the word they didn't think we should have had that word on they thought we that that wasn't correct that they didn't identify with it so here's one i want to say uh let me pull up that go ahead and pull up that scripture uh emily if you're the one whoever's doing that okay here's a scripture in first corinthians 14 29 and i've i've brought this up many times when people write personally two or three prophets should speak and the other should weigh carefully or judge depending on the version of the bible you have what is said now yesterday you all did exactly what you were supposed to do scripturally some of you judged it to be absolutely a word from the lord and you you weighed it you felt good about it and you and you adhered to it whatever the word would be others of you absolutely keep that go ahead and keep that up there for a little bit just another minute or two others of you judged it as not from the lord it didn't bear witness with you you thought it shouldn't have been on the air so um again i want you whichever place you found yourself on you obeyed scripture because if we if we could put a little more natural language we would say and the others should weigh carefully for themselves uh what what is true or they should judge for themselves what is said and so you all did that but each of you wanted us to not do the other thing if you didn't like it you didn't want us to put it on if you loved it you wanted us to put it on so it's on we can't pull that back but i want to hear i want to compliment you for obeying scripture and doing doing what the word said you weighed carefully and you arrived at a conclusion now some of the words in there that i that and i'm kind of in the middle frankly because there were headlines there one of the a prophet got in touch with me and said uh his discernment was that some of the headlines that chris reed read were actually accurately read but it was what the um what we were supposed to pray against it was what the enemy planned but not what god planned so i don't know i'm in the middle on that i don't know which way i i mentioned yesterday on the program that we have uh food for two to two to three weeks we've got food here and probably extras for our kids if anything happened and we've got uh i have a safe so i put a little bit of cash there in the safe and our gas we try to keep our gasoline filled because of the supply supply change we've been talking about this for months because of the supply chain and the shortage on that so between food and gasoline that's how you prepare and when you go shopping get an extra can every time you go shopping you know maybe two cans or something so you begin to stock up so for the nice lady that wrote she says i'm 70 years old what am i supposed to do well each time you shop get an extra can or two the lord doesn't warn you the night before he warns you in a season before so that you have time to prepare so i hope that that is clear johnny enlo pointed out to me he contacted me this morning he said by virtue of the fact you were saying don't be afraid now now don't be afraid it's almost like we invited people to be afraid you know he has a good point in that we didn't mean to do that but some people heard me say that and said oh man this must be something to be really afraid of so um yeah so maybe next time i won't emphasize don't be afraid because i kind of had the opposite but i really wanted you all to see that and know that and if you decided that this word was not for you you don't discern us from the lord just ignore it don't don't even worry about it just just ignore it just say that one wasn't for me i think steve blew it by bringing that word on and the people that love the word then just keep loving it you know and that's good you're all being scriptured all right it's 11 11 behind me that's a prophetic number all right now i want to talk just for a minute before we bring kat on you all know that we've drilled the wells in uganda and we're drilling that we're now researching drilling wells for the native american people here in the united states what we need you to do and go ahead and bring that that email up mike sally has taken mike and laurie sally have taken on the task to help us find locations where water wells are needed and i was stunned to find out how much water how many water wells i needed among the first nations people throughout the united states we had started with the navajo nations we still haven't necessarily found the solution so what we need you to do and i'll just read this if you know of pastors and i mean native american pastors on on a reservation who know about their need for water for the first nations people and i included the navajo because we were trying to find something for the navajo down in new mexico and arizona just email mike sally just mike sallywater gmail.com we're leaving it there for a minute so that you you can see it so we really really want to help but we know that the issues among the first nations people are different than in uganda you find a place they need a well here it's a village you don't you you don't particularly get permits it is a drill and there it is there's there are tribal councils and there are elders and there's chiefs and they they have a protocol that we have to follow that's why we find a pastor in it it doesn't have to be a pastor it could be a native american we we had we were up in south dakota um calling up there mike was and there was a i i don't know if you called him an elder but he wasn't he's not a pastor but he was a great contact up in the south dakota area that they're working on finding solutions for water so we're making calls so go ahead and email mike sallywater gmail.com and maybe what you do maybe the maybe the email that you write will be the one that ends up getting the native peoples and on some of these reservations some great water so let god use you in that way so all right well god bless you it's time to bring kat in here good morning cat good morning so we did a little house cleaning today and uh what are your thoughts do you have any thoughts about what you heard as far as i actually didn't hear any of it on purpose so you'll have to tell me what it is okay well we can judge by what man is saying and i will tell you this not knowing what any of it is i don't interpret dreams i'm a prophet i say what god says that's good and i tell you what he showed me when i woke up this morning before we say anything the father said make sure you tell everyone to still in this time it is still a time to celebrate good and only celebration is coming people before one word is spoken to me this is a time of acceleration into the great things of god this is not stepping backward waiting and hoping that the enemy does not attack you so now you may say what you want to say yeah well that's good and well because it was a dream i don't have to tell you the dream because you don't interpret dreams well let me ask you this um you in the in one of the dreams part of the interpretation was that the military may have to take over at some point um and that there would be some time of jubilee i personally think those two things are probably correct has the lord told you about the military coming or a time of jubilee that's coming to us like debt cancellation and that kind of military did come it wouldn't be for war right it wouldn't be to fire weapons right so i don't know what the other 45 is actually going to do i will just tell you what god has said there will be no world wars there'll be no world war three this is a time of great celebration and the whole exposure of the darkness is wise being shown the darkness is not crawling and creeping out of every crack so they can try to take over and kill us all this is the time for them to be exposed so they can be taken down okay not the just not the righteous this is not the day of his wrath this is day of his power and i will also say this when something comes from a group who doesn't even know what timing is on god's timeline then what will come out of their soul may be something that ends up more towards the end of the bible than in than what's in the heart of god so i don't speak according to what it's at the end of the bible people that's not what's happening at all if that's only been put in your soul that's what you've been waiting on or living on then everything you speak that comes out of the soul profit or not profit that's going to be geared towards that happening in other words they can see the possibility or even dream about the possibility that the end is coming or or taste or the pre um cursor to the end we're not getting the precursor to the end of this country what we're going to get as a precursor to the millennial reign of christ is what is about to happen to christ a taste of that happening so no matter what people dream by the way dreams can be messed with really really well by the end of me let me interpret dreams i can only adamantly say what he showed me would happen and when i woke up this was his word for everyone watching regardless of anything that was spoken to me this is still a time and all that i hope by what god said to eat cake and celebrate people a celebration does not sound to me like everything is going to go downhill we have to hide in holes if you want to keep extra stuff in your pantry that's up to you the holy spirit just said that to me again not knowing what was said i on purpose did not listen that's good i'm proud of you too you can't i will paint three maybe you'll have guests drop by when the other thing never happens that people have said will happen i'm just saying right now from god himself this is a time of celebration for i have said in these days greatness will be seen upon the earth the darkness will be crushed and pushed back no man will take over this earth no man will take over this country the villain sitting in that seat will be ejected and rejected and his words will become dust and the words of those who speak against the time i have appointed to happen their words will be dust also so very count closely the word you're believing and after that will live by it may take you off the path i have put you on to go into greatness and acceleration into great power might and wealth for that is what i have purpose and nothing else have i purpose stop getting tired of waiting on what i'm going to do i have the perfect time because time comes from me not man so when you hear the words of a man over here the heart will heal the words that i have purpose from my own throne that these are days of greatness and glory not demon gloom not stepping back not getting off the track but being prepared quickly into the destiny i have for this country this world in each and every one of your lives for if the words don't give you inspiration empowerment and they begin to put fear in you they are not from me because perfect love casts out fear it doesn't create it it doesn't advertise it it doesn't market it those words are not for me if they have brought fear to your soul says your god that's good wildcat that was good i love it when the spirit comes on you like that that's good you know it may wear you out but it encourages us to hear a great word like that so yeah i think you're right on time and by the way thank you for being so um diligent is the word having so much integrity not to listen what you knew you weren't supposed to listen to i didn't hear anything yeah so you had your staff cut that off so you couldn't see it yeah and that's good you know i've watched you cat on flashpoint and they're going around well what do you think lance and what do you think hank and what do you think and they'll come to you and you'll go i don't do panels i just tell you what god says and then you launch into it so i do add one little thing yeah i read the scripture that was put up there and people have always uh not taken that for revelation on i'm telling you it says let two or three prophets speak and then let the others the others are not humans or people they're prophets let the other prophets judge okay not the people okay no what other people are thinking trying to figure out why that two or two or three prophets you know they speak what god has said the other prophets get the true prophets yeah the ones who've jumped off the thing and thrown their self under the car uh i'm done by the true prophecy god judge what those words are so if you heard a prophet respond in the way that i just god just spoke to you that prophet was correct oh that's good yeah and yeah people we put on most of the people we put on our prophets but some are prophetic people they don't call themselves prophets ironically johnny enla who's one of the most accurate prophets i've ever met does not call himself a prophet he is he's a prophet but you know other people you know i i get i'm a member of different lists and some some are just those that prophesy they're not they're they don't have the anointing level uh like you johnny and all those that i don't know but when you sit in the office the office means a seat with that name on it that god put on there that is a true prophet you can be prophetic you can be a prophetic in the bible whatever but a prophet that sits in the office of a prophet and accurately speaks what god is saying there is an anointing on that not just annoying there's power on it it pierces the darkness it pierces anything the enemies tried to plant people's souls and there's no way you can deny that presence you can't fake the presence of god right so if a prophet has responded to what was said and they didn't agree with doom and gloom or whatever that was that prophet was very accurate that's good very very good well i'm going to go out and get some more chocolate cake that's my favorite kind i love it you know i had and i had drinks and we're trying to do our diet and i said dream get me some chocolate cake you know it was it was so good just these really big ones and i had her cut it in half and then then i kind of make it last but even the halves are pretty big but there's nothing cupcakes make cupcakes i don't know there was a time when chocolate was hardly in the united states i've seen some of the specials about that i don't know how this country lived without chocolate you know hershey hershey came along boy talk about an anointed gift from god by the way if he's in heaven what would someone like hershey do in heaven make candy i knew you'd say that i'm going there he'd have candy he'd have a candy shop that's what he had oh man yeah yeah so that's good by the way um prophets use you know even the scripture says as for prophecy it will cease so if a prophet and that's has been his or her whole life almost from childhood their seer their prophet so when they get to heaven what and we're going to talk about heaven in just a minute here um but what would the what would a prophet do if so that particular gift is not needed it would be their hobby okay i will be a photographer in heaven i i i carry the title of revelator prophet king in the spirit realm you know commander of the host i mean i have a lot of titles that when i get to heaven they won't be needed i just won't be doing that but what i will be doing is my passion with the thing that i would love to do most of the time if i could would be a photographer so i am a photographer who happens at this time to be a prophet and people do ask you a lot in heaven about the pr the prophecies that were doing how undone they were and awesome but you'll be doing that as you're taking pictures if you're a photographer okay uh maybe i don't know uh rodeo king whatever golfers for some reason a lot of people in the ministry are in law there's no lawyers need or no doctors needed um so whatever their passion maybe it's fishing maybe it's golfing maybe it's creating maybe if it's art that they have a side thing that they love to do it's what the gift is god made you everybody has a gift even if you haven't identified it it could be a you know it could be someone singing an opera it could be and you always wanted to do that play some instrument and that's your whole passion you think about it all the time you will be doing that and your whole mansion will be designed around that gift so that's why the gifts the gifts that are irrevocable aren't talking about spiritual gifts people they're talking about the gifts we need to operate and have things on this earth you do all that for fun in heaven and there's no charge everything is given to you so you actually never miss your destiny not even the babies because when he sent them he put a gift in them wrote it on them so whatever they're supposed to be they will be that in heaven as eventually when they grow up wow well so before you came on and uh the lord was saying that for the last 24 hours have cat start from the beginning because there's been thousands literally hundreds of thousands because we have 1.2 million different viewers in it every 90 day period so there's been hundreds of thousands who have never heard the initial what you call what is it heaven 101 is that what you call it uh well there's many things god sometimes calls it the big picture about and actually i will probably start before the earth was made we won't take too long doing it because the only big picture is where did you come from okay where did you come from where did i come from where did we all come from we all came from the same place so do you just want me to start yeah go for it cat just go for it uh well there's a scripture in the bible that says in him we live we move we have our very being that means existence of the prophets and poets of all the ancient days have spoken of these things that's actually in the bible that's not talking about jesus people jesus didn't carry all of us inside of him like a mother uh that would be the father that's why he's called the father uh the father god we all were in him we were little our little spirits were in him yes it was your spirit everybody has a spiritual body we all lived in him we moved in and out on the on the rays of the rainbow that's in him we live we move you move out you can only go as far as that rainbow goes back in him it's very uh the rainbow around the throne of god is not stagnant it's a lie it moves it looks like the aurora borealis which i love the aurora borealis it represents how the rainbow moves in and out of the father and we as little spirits inside of him would jump on it we would jump on it ride it out as far as it would go we would ride back in like like a fun ride we played in the river of life that comes from him every single one whoever was on this earth came from that place there's no other one that creators have brought us to the earth he sent us with a purpose the purpose was to be the gift he made you to be so that's why we have so many things we have designers we have people who grow things who flourish i mean i the list is unending that that everyone has a gift the best barbecue ever in this world whatever people who love to cook that's their passion and right now the major shows i'm going to jump ahead the major shows anywhere online or on television are people who have a gift whether it's remodeling things or cooking things baking things creating things those shows that honor the people with these gifts they they get you know they get judged and then they win things or whatever people want to know what it is you do and if you're really good you don't usually have to advertise yourself people will be drawn to you because of that gift well in heaven everybody gets to use that gift god said go back to the beginning so the beginning before the earth was made there was the father's house the father's house it talks about it's not a building it is a world bigger than our entire galaxy wow the earth is round people it's not flat i've been in heaven so many times i did lose count after the third first 1 000 times i do have a commission and yes that jesus came in person to tell me the father and he were going to start taking me on tours of heaven they wanted to reveal heaven to earth i never asked for this commission now i have to let you know it's not my gift that's a temporary position but it is a commission and so they take me whenever they want to they take me back before time began so i love it in genesis 1 1 people don't really understand what that means in the beginning okay in the beginning the heavens that word the heavens and the earth that is not the world called heaven the world called heaven has always always existed even before time so in the beginning means at the beginning of time when god made the physical realm and wrapped it around the whole spiritual realm that's the beginning we're talking about so before that bt before time we lived in the father the angel tribes were being created by the father by the by the son whose name was the word back then the word the holy spirit and the father they work together that's why they're the three in one they have the ability to step inside of each other and i'll just tell you the way the father showed me he took me to heaven one time and he said well we really want to do something about people thinking we're a three-headed god are people not understanding who we are so this is how we show you so i'm standing there before the throne of god which i'm always undone by his love i'm like i'm eight years old people so anybody can understand this and there's a father sitting on the throne glorious there's uh the word his son next to him sitting next to him the holy spirit's on the left side of the throne where the reservoir or the oil of the spirit is kept by the way just an extra little thing and so the father said we are the godhead and then all of a sudden he just he made this little shout and and jesus gets up and steps literally inside the father totally disappears and the holy spirit comes and steps inside the father and then the father does this we are the three in one and i'm like i know could understand that and then and then then the holy spirit steps out and comes to the left side of the throne jesus comes out and sits next to the father he said we are the godhead bodily so this is what jesus did this is what jesus meant when he said don't you know i'm in the father and he's in me that's it he's just gonna talk about that scripture oh okay sorry god you and me and me and you uh may they be one even as we are one when you go to heaven people jesus will step inside the father holy spirit steps inside the father and you standing before the throne will step inside the father wow i hope that does something to you yeah i mean that's like huge because it always i always thought it was metaphoric or poetic or you know we're so unified that he's in me and i knew oh no literally and when he says you invite christ to indwell you christ a layer now this is the thing you have to understand the the divine the divinity the three the godhead they have unlimited layers of their self that doesn't mean you'll see 50 layers of them displayed in heaven although they could do that or a thousand or ten thousand are unlimited but your soul is made in their image when god said let us make man in our image the way they're designed the way they weren't creator mermaid they just always existed like that but inside of their own soul there are layers of themselves so when you invite christ into your life he takes a layer of his own soul and puts it inside of you and he is indwelling you when you give yourself to jesus christ he reaches inside of you this is like now takes a layer of your soul that looks just like you and he seats in heavenly places so you literally are there a part of you there a part of your soul you gave it to him is seated in heavenly places i could see myself i mean you can see yourself right now sitting on a little throne somewhere really really yes as a cat is this what it means when you know when people say well you need to you need to declare a decree from a third heaven perspective because you realize you're actually there in some yes and let me tell you that layer of your soul it's still you it looks just like you talks acts like you of course in heaven there's no you know there's no slip ups and no there's no profanity there's no there's no hate there's no anger there's no wickedness no evil soul that lay of your soul never experiences that you know down here and there's where bombarded i'm getting way ahead of everything so let's go back let's go back to those okay so the father and and the word and holy spirit had this big meeting together and at that point we were all still in the father now it was no surprise the word jesus christ knew we lived in the father he he knew that holy spirit knew we lived in the father because it's very evident you see us little spirits run flying out and you know on the little rainbow one thing not little i'm sorry the the beams or the waves of the rainbow that comes from god they knew we lived in him besides remember when they stepped inside they saw us inside now you have to picture the father as having if you step inside or could peek inside you see no end to his being it is not a human he's not a human and we we mistakenly say oh he looks like a human no no no you're wrong go way back we look like him because he has a head he has arms a leg he's got a torso we were made in their image so they don't look like creatures father son holy spirit don't look like creatures they they look like real beings the divine the divinity okay they have a face it's the wrong they have they can they can move and go places new things of course things we can't do but the father always had a plan to make a place now this is all spirit realm so your little spirit person didn't need to have oxygen to breathe it didn't need to be fed or anything and you actually didn't have to make many decisions when you lived in him except am i going to ride on the next ray that leaves god am i swim in the river of life and in in the father and that we we knew we were his offspring we knew it that made us different than the angels the angels were actually created in tribes they were they were the first tribes not not the israelites the first tribes were the angelic tribes we won't go into the whole history about the angelic tribes they they went through a lot of stuff too when lucifer tried to take over later but so so this is what heaven was like it was beautiful things beyond your imagination the ability to do things in heaven that you can't do on the earth even now you ride on light in heaven you ride on you ride yourself on the rainbow you shout glory to god and a rainbow comes out of your mouth in heaven and you walk across the crystal sea on it this is life in heaven this is what life is like before he made the earth uh he knew there would be things that would happen he knew that we would be in we would have flesh on us but instead of having us forever and ever just having little spiritual uh bodies he wanted us to have a physical body that was our it was all our own you are his sons and daughters you were his sons and daughters when you lived in him and you were sent to earth and yes you if you got married you you were married because it takes two of us together to create children a man and a woman not two men or two men we'll throw that in for free the father designed it that way for a purpose but he decided finally let's start doing this and so they would go somewhere where there was nothing and and the father would speak a word from his mouth like physical realm and then the word would make that physical realm he actually took a scroll out and and rolled this whole physical realm around a part of the spirit realm and on that canvas the physical realm uh god began to speak about the planets and the stars and he didn't make the sun or the moon yet at that time because the earth in the beginning was lit with his glory okay the first earth which is still the one where was lit with the glory of god there was no sun or moon uh when it was first made okay and so the word made the physical round they began to put the planets out there the stars the nebulas began to create this very beautiful background for for for time to begin for time to begin and then when the father was ready uh of course during that little break in there uh lucifer was cast out of heaven at one point because he tried to do the big takeover does that sound familiar this is what heaven's doing that's what they laugh at the left at the liberals of the evil wicked they're laughing because they're like little pieces of dust on this earth thinking the god i mean he holds the air they breathe people he does hold the air they breathe so but but he decided is let's go ahead and do this and so he made the earth and he lifted with his glory the original earth was lit with the glory of god we were still inside the father by the way he's been from the beginning to the end and then to the beginning and before he made the earth you went with him really whoever left the father we we didn't live somewhere else in heaven we always lived in him so when the father went to the end we were with him when he went back you were with him you've actually seen before time when god was back there you were with him i know that may be difficult you're saying we didn't he and therefore we he didn't just see the end and notice like he went there yes not as if it was the end he actually went to the end right of time and when i say the beginning when the bible says the beginning that's the beginning of time not the beginning of god or the word or all of heaven itself the world called heaven his house has always existed the beginning the word which is in the beginning is when time began when they started counting time when there was different hours of the day and all that started so the end of time means they won't need time anymore that doesn't mean things will stop existing by the way you'll you'll always exist and that's why it's important to know who you're going to exist with you get lakeside property where it's fire all the time or you get the glorious world called heaven until he makes the new earth so this is our beginning literally that's where we came from everyone that says he is our father we are his offspring we lived and played in him and he began to write on the soul of each one of these little beings what they would be when they came to the earth he even wrote on your soul i know the scientists say well it depends on father mother whatever what you know what um gender they're going to be and everything like that but the father already knew he wrote it on your soul remember he wrote that book about you uh he wrote on your soul like male female whatever and so at the time when the earth was made and he was done with that earth the first time of course it was being destroyed by satan so it says in the bible god turned the lights out and that's when the waters were covering the earth when god made the earth originally i'm going to try to keep it short when he made the earth originally there was no rain there was no raining on the earth like raindrops on the earth so when he made it he lit it with his glory he put a water vapor shield up way out in the sky around this whole earth so it was like in this bubble and there was layers of moisture and water so the sky of the earth was even different back then it was like a pinky peach because the light came from the earth itself it would meet this this misty uh a thing was put around the earth and it was like a peachy glow is this what it was referred to as the firmament is this what you mean is this the firmament where it is the permanent the burma is part of what we would call the sky or the atmosphere around the earth but the reason why he had to do that was he put dinosaurs not satan the saint clinton satan couldn't create a leaf people okay god put dinosaurs on the earth when he made it the first time so the water vapor shield had to be there because remember this is now a physical realm uh it had spirit realm in it but it was a physical realm these are physical dinosaurs he put on the earth they have the evidence of their bones and by the way that footstep they find was not cro-magnon man that was a watcher angle there's a whole tribe of angels that have flesh on them they were assigned to the first earth to watch over all of the um the flowers could be a hundred foot high trees could be three or four hundred feet high within on the earth at that time and they were sent there to take care of those to care for the dinosaurs who were very friendly and then of course we all know something happened when lucifer tried as big get take over thinking god didn't know what was going on and guess what happened he knew exactly what was going on and when that when the right moment came uh lucifer no longer had the ability to influence in heaven to lead worship in heaven he was cast out of heaven to the earth and it says in jeremiah that satan began to make the earth a wilderness so god turned the light out so yes it's in there people that means he removed his glory off the earth he broke the water vapor shield that was twice as much water around the earth it hit the earth it broke into the different continents overlapping in many places that's why they know that out in the desert they knew at one time that was an ocean they can't explain i just explained it because i was shown how that happened so when god decides so here's the earth covered in water and it says that in verse two so verse one it was made verse two something has happened right it's in darkness the spirit of god is hovering over the waters which are covering everything they're covering the sky they're covering the land he begins to take it apart it says so in the bible he began to lift the water off and to expose the firmament he took the furman up above the earth again and he began to re-make the earth so the next time he makes it was when they put man on it they decided to create all the creatures they made all the creatures we didn't come out of a slug out of a pond somewhere people we can't believe in god and so he began to send uh the little spirits of life of course we all know in the garden of eden or east of eden is the correct way to say that the garden was east of eden and it was a beautiful place and of course we know that he created adam's body there was no life in that body but guess what the bible says the father now we know the word made the body the word made that body and you should listen to how robin bullock describes that is quite fascinating yeah it is fascinating but there was actually uh a mold made he made a mold and then late in that moment and so anyway so so the word was jesus made adam's body but there was no life in that body until the father leans over and breathes into the nostrils of adam a spirit of life that was adam's little spirit that was living in the father and when he breathed it in it said adam became a living soul how about that it didn't say human being being a living soul your soul is very important and that's how adam was made and then of course god realized as things went by that adam needed a lot of help so we are the helpers us men us men do need the actual helpers and the people people yeah need some women to help us yeah that's what he said i need another part okay so he takes adam's rib out and makes eve from that rib which means we're supposed to be together people okay uh out i need to give you stop and give you a little tip when you die if you're married it's okay you live right next to each other but when you left heaven and were sent to the earth you were god's son or daughter whether you're a male or female son or daughter when you go home to heaven it says when you're married till death do us part what does that mean that means you will no longer be married because you have to go home as his son or his daughter because he's making a mansion for every son and daughter is fine that all the families live in mansions uh next to each other or connect sometimes don't don't be concerned about that be so excited that you're part of the glory and the light and life forever with him and so that's how this whole thing started we came from him he timed our birth on the earth and so after that man began to cover the earth uh uh and uh we know the other times that what happened to your history talks about that but you need to know where you came from everyone has a soul that soul is your mind what you think about your will is so important is what you choose you don't choose once in a while you're choosing every minute of every day what you will say what you will do what you will display and by those actions you put out there you're showing people who and what you believe in so if you're manifesting for god out of this mouth should be life should be the love of god it should bring hope it should bring excitement it should bring empowerment uh that's what we should say as sons and daughters of god that's what we're here for and so but the other side who wants to live in the darkness promote the darkness and then be evil the more evil you get you don't just want to hear about or talk about you actually want to do the evil because you're filling your soul with that with that evil you're feeling it full of darkness and when i walk by people i already know if they know christ there's no light in them they're not one ray of light in them and the stronger believer you are you have it comes out of you because when you choose christ as a believer when you choose him to be your lord your savior at that at that very moment in time when you choose that and you say yes to him you repent of your sins your name there is an actual book in heaven that the father opens this massive book and he writes your name in that book and so that's how that happens that's not all that happens when you are born again christ takes a deposit of the anointing that he carries and he puts it in your soul and it lives there first john 2 27 there is a scripture for you when you receive jesus christ as your savior you get a deposit of the anointing and it abides in you that is in the word of god what is the anointing it is a weapon it's a weapon against darkness it breaks the yoke of darkness you release it everywhere peter released so much it didn't it wasn't his shadow that healed people it was the cloud of the anointing the more you release the anointing the more that cloud of that anointing that you carry comes from you i'm not talking about someone who's anointed to sing someone who has a really wonderful anointing on their life to create things that's a whole different anointing but the anointing you get when you're born again that is the deposit of the anointing christ walked in because we are joint heirs with him and he said the things i did you will do also so he actually gave us a deposit of his anointing when you are born again the father takes a stone of fire from himself puts it in your spirit and it gives your spirit light because remember before that there's no light in you so someone who just got born again you have a light of god coming from you you're carrying the anointing and people hand you a little bible and say good luck and yet that's not all there is that's just the beginning of your journey with christ and know him more to pursue to know him more but when you're born again you really are born again angels record it they take it up to heaven it's given to the father no the father doesn't need anyone to record it but he likes to do certain things he likes to do things together with people he liked to do things with christ and or with the word and so you literally lived in him moved in and out and right now going up to heaven i still see and i'm gonna give you uh give you a little tip jesse to plant us all right up to the throne he saw the little spirits of life he saw them going in and out of the father he saw it himself a little girl was caught up to heaven and she came back and told her parents i saw fireflies because your spirit man is made out of light i saw fireflies coming out of god in and out of him so there's other witnesses to that so we all came from there whether you believe in him or trust him or want to know him that is where you came from no one came from some other world there's no other place that god started then abandoned there's heaven there's earth there's all the physical realm and just let's jump to the whole end when time is no more he's going to roll it up why it even says you'll roll it up it does he knows where the ends of the physical realm are he's going to roll him up he'll make a new worth why because the heaven is the father's house he's making a new earth and the father is going to move from heaven to the new earth it will be our home together so even when time is no more we will never stop existing we'll never stop again and jesus knows the thoughts and intents of every person's heart on this planet no one's hiding no one's getting away with anything and that's why i can boldly say what's coming next is not the rapture it's not the perilous times it is not the tribulation it's called justice justice against the evil and the darkness has been trying to take this country and take this world if you're out there you're from some other country even believe in god keep celebrating people because it's going to happen heaven is the most glorious place ever from the moment let's go jump uh jump back a little bit when you pass away now in this at this time if you passed away i've been president when many people leave their physical body your spiritual body at the time you stop breathing and that little line in the hospital goes beep it's the beginning of the rest of your life it isn't the end of your life your body this body sleeps there is no soul sleeping people that be like taking you and sticking you in the ground and burying you right now that doesn't happen your spirit and your soul is always awake it never has to sleep your body has to take a nap every now and then on the earth i i sleep for a couple hours so but but this physical body that will die when the dead in christ shall rise that's your body because your spirit man with your soul intact has been living in heaven he goes jesus said my father goes to prepare a place for you that was jesus saying those words okay so that you can be with them when you die you can be with them to be absent from the body is to be present with the lord there's the evidence i know there's whole denominations that believe when you're dead you know nothing you're just sleeping yeah i mean that's the way i was raised i absolutely believed it you know but yeah yeah you're so alive you are more alive in heaven uh in heaven you exist to live okay that's the way you can say it on earth you have to make a living in order to exist but in heaven you exist to live the greatest life you ever had and there's so many things to do in heaven because we all have gifts all those amazing gifts are created in heaven uh places for them to happen and when you get home to heaven when this spiritual body who who that still you when it steps out of the physical body you will be young there'll be no handicaps if you're blind you won't be blind you're sick you won't be sick if you're missing limbs you won't have any limbs missing you'll be able to touch yourself you're you'll be get you're probably glowing most most christians have a light you see the light that's in them your spiritual body still looks like you but like about in the 20s maybe 25 years old like that you look young if your 100 year old grandma died don't call her back she's not for sure can't when you go and when you pass away and you're now you've got this you're you're free from all this junk and your bodies did do you do you suddenly remember your time with the father i've never asked you this question before do you remember you were there before have you ever seen anything about that i think i actually i actually remember that on the earth i can remember myself sitting in the hand of god just a little little little spirit uh and uh him telling me about things that i would get to do on the earth for him oh wow and then then that memories kind of taken from you you have to make your own decision if you choose him or not use him but i can tell you with jesus christ pursuing all of us holy spirit coming alongside of us we all have guardian angels every person usually has two and when god knits us together this is how it happens i don't even talk about that when he's ready to send you from heaven to earth he'll take your little spiritual being and hold it in his hand and the last thing he says is i love you wow i want you to know me then the holy spirit will take that little spirit spiritual being and he goes in the womb of the mother at that time of conception and he knits and attaches that little spirit of life which is you that you're spearman he attaches it to that dot of flesh it says i knit you together in your mother's womb that doesn't mean you put your arms and legs on that means you somehow you i knit you together he knit you to that dot of flow and your spirit man will adapt to that flesh so as your body grows your spirit man gets a face it gets a permanent image and the angels are sent at the time the father sends you from himself your guardian angels go with you and they're outside the mother waiting for you to be born and that's how the birthing happens so let's go forward when you pass when it's time when it's time to go into heaven or just something happens and your spirit man male or female when it steps out of that body you're flooded with the life of god the joy of the lord you will see your guardian angels for the first time waiting to take you there is no fear i know they say there's fear and death maybe on the way to diane but the second you die and step out of this body you belong to god there is no fear anywhere excitement flood your soul joy flood your soul you love the people if they're present in the room they'll even wave goodbye to them you probably never get to see that some people get to see it and then there's a transport sent for you it could be any kind of a transport some look like starships some are chariots if jesus comes he's got his own chariot of fire and he'll take you on up to heaven you go through the whole cosmos by the way they do not use the word universe in heaven oh really all the stars and all the skies that god made the word cosmos means by divine design the word universe means the big bang is here and there's no and there's no one way that he takes you like he said a transport jesus could show up angels could you know it's always i've seen even um you know people think well they'd be afraid especially young boys they come in and pick them up in a spiritual biplane like an old biplane that's funny and they get a helmet put on them by their angels and they shoot off up to heaven i've seen things that come down that look like this glorious elevator it comes straight down it's made out of light and when it opens sometimes he lets some of your family members come with him and and they are saying come on and they they they jump and their spiritual body they'll jump in the elevator and the doors close and off they go to heaven so i think it's whatever would delight each individual person and then once you get into heaven you get out there's a there's a deep disembark disembark a place where you disembark you see the river of life right there you see the welcome center off in the distance for the people who are in kind of shock like why is there music why are people dancing why am i seeing my pet why are these things flying there's the dinosaur just flew by what is this people riding on light uh they're laughing uncontrollably in heaven thinking it would be boring and so they get escorted by the heritage family to the welcome center but usually jesus many times doesn't wait for you to come into the throne when he meets you he'll get you in the river of life you step in the river of life it floods you he begins to throw the water on you then you have a water fight this is reality really and you're laughing and laughing laughing so hard all your family are running through the gates because you can see the gates a little bit away so this is just so you can experience part of heaven uh before you ever get to the gate and so uh usually the pets outrun the family members they'll usually be there first and they'll step out of the river and everybody's just hugging and hugging and and uh you know kissing each other they're so excited and they said we're so happy that you're here and then they all go into they begin to walk into the throne room that's an experience when the doors are thrown open wide you've never seen crown molding the crown molding all along this big mess of hallway you see a light coming from the throne which is high and lifted up in the center of the throne room it's not on the back wall everyone goes all the way around the throne and they're singing they're dancing they're celebrating because someone new has come home to heaven and jesus walks you up the steps that's such a simple statement because the throne is high and lifted up and in the river of life's flowing down these steps and there's gifts all up and down these steps and people are just worshiping and celebrating all over the living creatures are standing on the four sides of the throne at the at the bottom of those steps of the living creatures and and they're massive eyes all in their body they walk upright they have golden hooves for feet their wings are embellished with so many eyes they don't have eyelashes they look like the colors of a peacock and and their heads they're huge they have eyes everywhere and so there's four sets of steps going up the throne in the middle of the throne room you're trying to take all this in here's the the glory cloud over you can't even see the ceiling the place is so massive the seraphim dipped down out of the glory cloud their hair is on fire it's like blue fire uh just declaring things over god and over his son on the throne this is what everyone experiences you feel like you're gonna melt in your mouth when you see jesus for the first time you look in his eyes and you're like he always loved me he died just for me and the reality of it really just hit you for the first time in your life i'm so glad people didn't give up on me that people kept praying for me to know christ don't ever stop praying for your family members to know christ don't ever stop doing that and then you're you're experiencing this so there's like steps and then there's columns and then there's more steps than columns it's actually a structure it's a massive structure that is in the shape of guess what but what a pyramid or a yeah but it's actually that's where that's where they got that idea from by the way oh okay then stole satan stole images of god okay copycat them the first original thing that was built like this was the structure of the throne of god it is so high underneath there are rooms where people would go to intercede it talks about that they say the souls are under the altar and people are like how can you get under no no the altar is way up in front of the throne of god all of this on the inside of the throne structure people can go in there and pray and declare and so this your experience you're having this is your first experience with heaven millions of angels are all over in the sky outside the rainbow shoots out of the throne room and goes all over heaven to look for somebody and grab them and bring them back because god wants to visit with them all of this the flowers are singing they're alive they have life in them the river of life actually can come up and it has a face on it it begins to worship god this is in the throne room the river has a face the river has a face it has a light yes did you say did you say a face though and make sure did you say it i said a face and where the river of life the river of life flows out of the throne of god down the streets of gold the river that's in the streets of gold is the river of life that came from the father and then it goes all over heaven it creates uh streams it creates the the crystal sea um there's iowans on the crystal sea you can have a mansion on if god gave you one there uh the the crystal sea has a life and there's times where it will come up part of it in the crystal sea if you're standing on the banks and it will begin to worship god and everybody along the banks of the crystal sea is so massive everyone begins to worship god and then they break into celebration so it's between worship celebration in heaven is a form of worship because you're celebrating what he gave you that's the way you're grateful for doing that so you're you're not even up to the father yet right you feel like you're gonna know anything next to jesus christ the living god you know the son of the living god you can see the the holes which are here by the way they're not here and he wouldn't be able to stay on the cross or there's huge holes right here if you can put your finger through them uh but his eyes are sometimes flames of fire uh sometimes they're like just i say liquid pools of love and all you know is this i came from here and that's when the reality hit you steve the reality hits you when you're going up into the steps into the throne you knew that you knew that you knew you lived with him and when you finally he brings you up to the father and he says look father i have brought back to you your son or your daughter whichever you are and then he says your name and and then you see uh the outline of the father's face with all of this sound and frequencies and life and love flowing out of him he reaches out and takes you in his arms and holds you to himself and you think i'm never leaving him i'm never ever ever going to live without being in his presence i belong to him i remember living in him you knew that was your home he was your home in him you live you move you have a very existence you know at that moment steve you came from him and him alone that he is your actual father no matter who your father was on the earth or how you were treated you know on the earth of course satan is still present evil is present if that's not ever been shown to you uh you've been hiding somewhere but i will tell you this no power in the earth on the earth around the earth is greater than the power of the living god his son jesus christ and the holy spirit they have plans made for this time on the earth for greatness we get to be great we get to manifest and demonstrate for the living of god what are we demonstrating his power his words his plans we demonstrate them we do as his sons and daughters that's why it's called manifested sons and daughters the earth is in travail not because the end is here people is crying out for the sons and daughters to stand up and start being who they're supposed to be so what is god doing clearing the deck and the platform crushing and pushing back evil will not begin to arise for generations in the way it is now what is happening now exposure people that no one on this earth can stop they are so full of their self and the devil they think they're getting away with it they're given their own testimony of their evil that god clearly sees and knows about and he is sending justice so this experience when you finally get up to the father and jesus is standing there the whole time grinning from ear to ear it says in the bible that jesus came that he might make a way back to the father that's what i'm telling you what that's it this is that okay wow means this this is what you experienced everybody your family people who are in your family line from 500 000 2000 years ago 3 000 years ago you'll meet people that were in your generational line somewhere and they're all celebrating that you have come home to heaven and the father will turn you around when he's done hugging you and say look my son and give his name or he'll say my daughter and give your name they have come home oh wow and this is it sounds like so your generation's on your mother's side and your dad's side so is this like a pre-planned family reunion all of your family on both sides they already whenever whenever god already knows who was in what generation he already knows and by the way they in heaven know they're part of your generational line before you ever get there so they know you're coming home they know that somewhere down the line you were part of what they were doing on the earth for god uh you'll be surprised and be amazed to find who you're actually related to on the earth but everyone be everybody because jesus christ the bridegroom they call them their lord their king they want to be with him and yes you may have loved each other on the earth but everyone and those who were husband and wives will love jesus more than anything else in heaven really not good you're not going to miss the way you lived your life on the earth this is a such a higher uh life experience in heaven your your soul the some of the emotions finally come alive or you get to begin to express them but at the throne the father will start giving you gifts then really rewards he'll give rewards at the throne and then you'll get more actually for some time if there was time in heaven but he starts giving him and i love to tell use a whitney houston as an as an example because i was sitting on a pla sitting on a a road waiting to speak and the holy spirit said whitney houston has gone home to heaven and so when i got up i actually shared everything i saw and i i saw her before the throne she she was joy joy and speakable was coming over her if you don't know what happened to whitney the night before she passed uh she was in great depression at that time she was going through a lot of things and people she went somewhere um i think it was to some lounge or something and everybody was demanding that she sing they wanted to hear her sing and she kept saying i don't want to i don't feel like it and finally she said i will sing one thing and she get this is actual truth everybody knows well people who know know it that she got up and started singing um i'm trying to remember what she's saying jesus said jesus loves me is it messed with me she's being the same everything in her soul because she was at a point of brokenness and just really open to god she began to sing people said it was the most anointed thing they ever heard but something else was happening she was getting born again she's saying with all everything within her she was inviting jesus she was saying how much you know yes she just loves me saying that whole song by the end of the song she was born again and he went home and passed and and that's why the holy spirit said whitney houston has passed to heaven no she's passed away she's gone to heaven and at that moment sitting on the front row i was caught up to heaven at that moment saw her before the throne and the father said i'm so glad you've come home my daughter and he said here's a gift i have saved just for you and it takes out this little chest the most beautiful if the chest was alive the embellishments were alive on the chest he opens it and out of it comes a song and the father said only i have sung this song whitney i saved it for you and the song was like a red it was like a a garnet color it look it came out like it was alive it was a garment and it wove itself around her like this beautiful robe and when she stood there she'd move her hand you'd hear the father singing off of her oh man you can hear me sing but you will now sing the song for me all over heaven she was so undone she was so beautiful so filled with life and everybody was just just so excited in in the throne room they were celebrating they were congratulating her they were so they were blessing the father for giving her that for that gift and he said this is because you are willing to be the gift i sent you and no matter what you went through you never stopped using that gift so i have given you my own song just singing and is that this is that um there is a thing that says that he sings a song that nobody else knows or he gives you a name that you know i'm trying to remember the scripture but there's kind of a scripture that relates to that i yeah he he used to sing over by the way when this is god this is the father he's so amazing he can be as big and high as high up as he wants so to soak in christ christ can be as tall as he wants to something holy spirit i mean if if the father if the father when when he spoke and the word began to make the earth and then he hands it to the father now when the earth is done he hands it to the father and he reaches inside of himself and takes one handful of water from himself he's standing out nothing pours it on the earth it becomes the ocean on the earth and remember the water maple shield then he takes another handful and pours it over the earth so it's like a bubble and then he takes a second one and pours it over that's why i know there's twice as much water in the water vapor shield that flooded the earth so anyway revelation is the greatest thing ever he calls me a revelator this you know you reveal something for god so this is whitney's homegoing experience and and once you when you've been in the throne room people will want to greet you when the father finally lets you go and he'll tell you all these things he he has for you and how much he loves you and appreciated and so glad that you received his son and then he'll hand him eventually back to jesus who's been standing there all this time and he walks you back down to the steps and everyone starts celebrating in the throne room you have a throne room party and finally your family will say let's go see your mansion you got to see your mansion they've been watching it being built they'll take you to your mansion and then there's more gifts where those gifts come from when your family members go home every year that passes at your part they get a gift and put it in your throne in your in your mansion so you have a gift for every year you were apart from your family members waiting for your vision to be open and are these gifts clothes garments they could be anything they could be anything because there's so many things in heaven remember people who make these things are there this is made out of wood gemstones uh beautiful things to wear beautiful things to now your mansion is built not by man's hands they're built by god but a lot of people will buy things you like and put them in your mansion you know to embellish your mansion but these are gifts things that you love maybe something made out of crystal or just really beautiful pottery because people who are potters died what they have and they make beautiful things so they go all over heaven is it that they know well you know well steve when he was on the earth he used to like whatever and and they remember that so they get that kind of a gift okay and if you love flowers you will have five foot arrangements that will sing to you when you come home with your mansion wow i have a question you know you said heaven itself is bigger than our galaxy which is of course billions or trillions of light years and all that but um the earth is very finite if if god makes a new heavens and new earth and he comes down to live on earth does the earth become then this massive yes it's not the same size i don't know why people they they don't like to hear that the earth will be just taken away but it actually says it will i like it frankly i'd like it to melt with fervent heat as it says because i don't want any part of you know the darkness none it's gonna be okay it's gonna be okay you will so love the new earth the new earth will be millions of times bigger millions wow than this one we're on now you think about the city the city of god that's in heaven if you sat that city on the earth now the earth would go whoop they couldn't hold it it's so huge you can read in the bible and see how big it says it is uh with all the beautiful layers of gemstones that will come down on the earth and the father will get on that he's going to put all of us on the new earth when it's done so we get to see it first then he will come down to live with us forever i want to ask you a question because this meant a lot to me when i heard you say it one time i said did you really say what i thought you said because i think if it blesses me it must it will bless other people did you say in your mansion god will have preserved some of your favorite family photos and it would be is that is that what you said is that how you said it he doesn't have to preserve them he makes he makes his own he makes his own like he can take a picture of everything if it doesn't take a picture he recreates the same photos and they're framed in your mansion i've been in people's mansions and i saw family members who had not been born yet i saw there really yes yes that's amazing so he's already got the family portraits or the he's already got them there yes and you do live right next to each other although some people's property is so massive i love to tell the story about when the father showed me when he met when he said big when he what he says is wealthy is not what our wealthy is you don't understand wealth because you haven't seen heaven heaven's not poor why would it be poor when the bible says jesus became poor that we might be rich he was poor compared to heaven sanders when he left heaven and came to the earth that was it that's why he had to bring wealth to him he yeah you know the caravan that didn't bring one little flask of something one little thing of gold it was a caravan they had camels carrying great wealth they would probably take care of jesus the entire time he was on the earth he had the best scholars in egypt they fled to egypt he was in egypt for some not for a long time for for years i'm sure several years at least and and that's where they live for a while so that herod couldn't find him so that he couldn't be killed that's how he preserved him but jesus actually was wealthy by earth standards he had garments that had no seams in them they actually wanted the garments he was wearing when he went to the cross he had wealthy friends why because wealthy is drawn to wealth wealth is drawn to wealthy where wealth is people are going to follow after that and then they got to know him then i'm sure they that he became their savior at one point but he was invited to all the weddings not just one wedding that was quite a big wedding he was at where he turned the water into heaven's wine uh by the way he did that at home all the time that's why miriam knew he could do it that's it he was doing the miracle because it wasn't at home okay you know we had always always raised to believe that jesus was the poor among the poor of the galileans but you know he started off his life with gold frankincense and myrrh his father his father was a master carpenter right so there was a very wealthy person in the city wow and he knew that he knew the leaders of the city joseph knew the leaders of the city because you get there's a key given to you if you're one of the wealthy people you have you get a key sword like they say gates to the city thing uh the only reason well not because god planned it that way the reason why they didn't stone joseph was because they weren't willing to lose their master carpenter people i'm serious about that this is what the father said is that when i gave someone to raise my son in the same gift jesus has a gift he still makes things in heaven he's a master carpenter he makes things in heaven because he likes to joseph he had to have someone that could raise jesus up to be a master at what he sent him with that natural gift joseph was a master carpenter and he was wealthy and so he was they weren't willing so the city fathers actually got together and said what are we going to do about all this and so they told joseph put her away until after she has the child everything like that and uh and then of course they were married and then they had other kids and people say yes mary did mary had other jesus had siblings you had to suffer in every way like us yeah before he had you have siblings what is the what is the thing about because we've seen photos of him that akiana did where he's handsome yet there's a scripture about he did not have the form that we would desire him i can't remember the exact so was he a handsome man or was he he was sort of like a rugged type so he wasn't like what you would call there's guys i call like you know a pretty boy i could name after his names but i don't want to do that they're still who are so strikingly handsome right so they were trying what he was trying to portray was he wasn't he didn't want people to be drawn to jesus because he was so handsome right but he was definitely a man's man he was rugged he was strong he lifted trees to make the the stuff that he worked with so his hands were very probably callous they were rugged uh i i saw him he he's very rugged even today but it's the love that comes from him that captivates your heart so he's not he isn't not he's not ugly obviously at all but i would say definitely is a real handsome um god put him together pretty well yeah and did then can he ask you about his sense of humor on the earth now i know because i've heard testimonies of people with psalm in heaven he's hilariously funny was he funny on the earth did the yes oh let me tell you what you shouldn't i know i'm not telling anybody to go out and bash the evil and the wicked but i will remind you that jesus christ had a lot of his own personal one-liners to give to the religious hierarchy you were waiting sepulchers that means you were a gravestone filled with dead man's bones that was his own opinion of what he thought about the people who were taking people's money using it wrongly demanding their sacrifice wasn't worth anything and making them go pay more money that they probably got a part of that too and so jesus wasn't happy with the religious harkey what do you think he tore up the whole what he tore up in the courtyard was the money changers selling the goods that those hierarchy would get part of and they were cheating the people like to sell to buy a dove for for their sacrifice so their sins could be forgiven once a year they had to pay money for that jesus had had it so jesus definitely was a a character with a capital c he also knew how to make people laugh he made people laugh a lot but anyone who was around when he said those words they always wanted to say those words i'm quite sure everybody you've heard him say your white deceptice full of dead men's bones you're going to say that about them but they'd be strung out somewhere well you know that that series the chosen which i think is very very anointed now it's just an earthly um creation of a production but it's very anointed where they portray christ but i loved what they did is when he would work some miracles like the fish when he missed peter one of those first he was laughing and he was smiling at what he had done i mean i'm wondering if he was like that did he love what he did he laughed he laughed a lot i tell you you couldn't get um you couldn't get that many men to follow you no matter what if you weren't funny if you didn't have revelation beyond their understanding but the reason why he was funny was if all you got was the awe he'd be so immobilized you couldn't even move or think because of the power of the presence and the glory he carried humor will will not temper that but it balances the holy spirit the word is balanced yeah i had to live a balanced life he was hilariously funny but i tell you what and he was fierce against evil he didn't power any demon but he also had such sound wisdom and revelation he would get people like what child is going to keep uh you know captive when he was left behind at the temple and he missing for someone right yeah several days he was in the presence of those priests giving them revelation they had no way how does he even know this he he was captain that wasn't that was what he wasn't being funny then he was manifesting revelation that comes from the father that gets you completely undone for the first time you understand something when you get revelation so that's what he was giving them was revelation he didn't even stop to eat he was with them and here's mary thinking oh my gosh what is he eating how's he sleeping and they show up and there he is i have to be about the father's business i mean yeah he was he had friends he sat with sinners because these were business contacts this was a master carpenter they wanted their home built by the best carpenter but they also got the other stuff from him also i mean he shared all he could every time he had a chance so these meetings he would have a business people they would invite their friends to come and hear what he had to say and i know what that's like everywhere you go it's a meeting if you've got revelation and you know god wherever you go in the store in the marketplace at a business thing you're going to have an audience we i have audiences form at the checkout counter at the grocery store because they want to hear about revelation jesus i understand when they said he had no time to eat or sleep because people were pulling they want this something never heard before that gives you life that gives you hope that shows you the power in the living god and jesus shared it everywhere uh but one thing he never tolerated he never tolerated evil he didn't participate with it he didn't tolerate it at all and i and i you know in contrast not in contrast to that but along those lines the woman at the wells one of my favorite stories because she was full of sin he knew it yeah but he didn't condemn her he didn't allow it either but you know he must have had a gas of a time just saying you know if you kind of if you knew who i'm talking to who you were talking to you'd say give me a drink of water i mean it was probably a little more fun than we portray it you know he's always got i'm sure but i can tell you like i said he was a character almost everything he delivered it he his lines were they're probably forever put in eternity and you can go to a place in heaven and actually revisit i mean you're watching it but you can actually see him when he talks i would love that i would love that i'm talking to the woman at the well and you experience all the same thing the woman did the words he gave her nobody could have known that stuff who knew that she didn't know him how could he know that she was so captivated and she ran and said he told me everything i ever did and so but i'm sure he did it with quite uh it was quite joyful to him he did enjoy doing this and i love that i love that one and we better get going here but i love that part because the scripture records that well it's not you i know you're not your hus you know but you've had five husbands the one you're with and not your husband but when she goes into the city and says he told me everything i ever did there must have been quite some conversations going on it was quite conversation and i am quite sure that he gave names well wouldn't that be cool yeah what about that time with george you know wrote in the same remember that now look this is a thing the man was never accused of anything but that woman was accused and they all wanted to stone her so jesus this is what you're talking about the humor part when he squat down and began to write in the same he was making a list he wrote the name of a person with a stone and the sin they did the name of another one and the sin they did and he kept gone going and before all this group with their stones gonna stone this wicked person here was all the sins they did with their name jesus was making a less people oh good yeah it's so good enjoying it he probably was grinning oh yeah he's doing it i bet it you know it was so fun you know wow well kat this is so so good thank you so much this is a real shot in the arm of really happy stuff because god is so good i mean there's just it's just it's just like the whole time you've told the story you've just basically said the goodness of god the goodness of god the kindness of god the happiness of god the hilarity of god you know it's just amazing so well tell people how to get a hold of your uh site you've got revealingheaven.com on the web on the screen right there tell people what they can get there i want to make sure people when the father gave me the commission jesus brought it from me you know he the father he became his father and i want to give you commission to reveal heaven to earth we're tired of the myths and mysteries of man and the enemy and what they have told you we're going to let you know the truth and we're going to let them know the truth so we will take you to have a non-stop uh you don't get to choose when you come we're just going to take you whenever we feel like it we'll take this clear out and we'll keep your body alive and we'll take you and show you places in heaven you'll know we're going to show you how heaven operates which is a phenomenal uh how it operates is that people using their gifts their transportation system their if they had money it would be chocolate steep just there's nothing better than chocolate and so uh so we make products and i always like to show people we make products usually the holy spirit will give me a quote and he said we're going to give you quotes that are very bold but they won't bash man they will only bash the enemy which is satan so here's an example of this cup that says i don't do demons and that little lightning bolt right there the holy spirit said make sure you include that every time the satan sees that cup he'll know we still remember we kicked him out of the heaven on the lightning bolt that's good and of course the books here's here's a couple here's two of my books i'm writing in the midst of writing number three i don't know when it will be done um so it's where you find products our store is there uh we are still looking for a place to have our events we are gonna still have events here in our

person who does all that yeah you know i'm speaking in several places still this year and next year is going to be just wild because because god's doing stuff and then her.com is another website i have it's the spiritual platform where the father says whatever he wants to uh there's many uh training videos on how to uh declare over your family members you know that they'll go to heaven uh the the thing he gives a decree for that a lot of decrees you'll see interviews with people like uh patricia king and other people are on there there's also a gallery on catcure.com where i show different things in the spirit realm like what it looks like different places in the spirit realm and and so and i think there's testimonies on there and we'll be revamping both of those websites real soon we're going to be adding a lot of products like apparel and stuff like that that represent things in heaven and god's not done with anything people and i will just tell you this if he's telling me increase and acceleration is coming in every area of my life that means it's coming to yours too it's not going to need to keep things stored up somewhere because a war is coming other stuff is coming he knows what's going to happen he's been there people and so i know all he says for me is get ready to run faster than you have before uh be more have more say more he's not going to stop any of it very good well kat thanks for so accurately representing the lord the father son of the holy spirit that's so good you know i've heard some of these things before not every one of them but i can't hear it enough times because they just kind of re-energizes me i know it's doing that to the people too so energized go get some chocolate cake what what'd you say i want to say one more thing i want to assure you that none of your family members died alone if there was nobody there if something happened they're never alone those are angels are with them from the time that they were conceived the the minute they leave this body they will be with them they will be escorted in some glorious way all the way up into into heaven which is such a beautiful amazing place there's life and love everywhere everything is alive in heaven there's so many things that they can enjoy and do and their mansion will just rock them when they see it i i didn't get to finish holy spirit said i saw the mansion of an intercessor that was bigger than new york city oh my goodness that's how that's what kind of premium god puts on it praying intercessors wow that was an intercessor so but you loving people every time you did an act of kindness he remembers every single act of kindness and when you get your robe of righteousness he puts a gemstone representing every time you were kind for somebody that you love somebody you're just going to be undone he's he's got such many many things to give you and show you but of course being there and living that for all of eternity even when there's no time eternity will still keep going and there'll be places created that we can go and visit from the new earth uh and you'll never sin you can never your body will be glorified i forgot the holy spirit when the dead in christ will raise their body will be glorified those in heaven will already know about when the rapture is going to happen people you'll know first in heaven and then they will join come in the sky and then they we'll get their body it'll be glorified those who remain on the earth that are believers their bodies what does glorify mean it's different than eternal eternal means you exist forever glorified means you can never get sick you can never die you can never sin you live this powerful glorious life and so that's what your future is that's what god has for us so so good so good okay folks tomorrow is nathan french and he's the one that's also going to be he's our good friend too and he's going to be at in bend at the end of the month as well so god bless you
