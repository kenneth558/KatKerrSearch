well merry christmas everybody it's december 15 wednesday december 15 2021 welcome to the broadcast this is the next to the last cat curve broadcast uh for this year and then of course we pick it right back up next year uh by the way uh i'm i'm going to say this before i forget to make the announcement because i think or written at my note i might forget if i don't say it you know we have cats we have questions for cat already for today so we don't need those uh our staff decided it would be great to have you ask any and all kinds of questions about christmas as it relates to heaven or whatever cat knows is seeing understands so ask your questions about christmas for next week's broadcast most of the people put those questions underneath the youtube not in the chat to the right but underneath uh where you put your comments where they stay there not the ones that just disappear and roll off the screen um and there are other ways we get them too some people have hit reply and do different things that our preferred method is below youtube um and we'll try and look at other places as well but that's we're going to tell you that specific one so i want to thank everybody for your amazing donations yesterday we pretty much had an unprecedented number of donations and we really appreciate that this ministry is really growing by leaps and bounds uh after the first we've got several more people we'll be bringing on board in fact we'll make those announcements at the right time just a few of those we will announce like this i think that some of you have seen illumination who now works for us we we got her by making the announcement on the air so we will be making some announcements uh either next week or after the first i'll see what the staff wants to do and then people can then begin to send those in so we'll figure out how to do that and give you an address or email whatever the staff wants and we'll tell you which positions we're looking for so but anyway thank you very much for your generosity i know it's the as you we approach the year end many of you are trying to to determine what you want to do with your what things you want to do with your um final giving for the year we certainly appreciate you thinking about us you know i've said that we've built uh we've dug seven wells in uganda and and then we've doubled the size we paid for the construction of doubling the size of the health clinic on in that ugandan village i haven't even shown you that picture yet uh we have to work we're committed to do 24 to dig 24 new wells in and around that community and region and some of you who saw that video we'll show it several more times you saw that the people were drinking some of them when the water is running off of the piglet tree into the water that they they put in their drinking water and they bring it home it's just a horrific thing so we're digging freshwater wells thank you so much for your i i would say your help you know it's not just you helped us you did it it was your income that brought that money in and we sent it to mike and laurie sally of show mercy some of you want to check their ministry out show mercy.org they are in uganda so mike and laurie sally dear friends of ours we've known him for about 15 years they're doing a bang-up job out there and so we're we're going to do at least 24 or more wells next year we will probably increase that i feel like the lord's showing us that we'll increase that number significantly and maybe there'll be other areas we don't know but right now uganda's our is our place anyway thank you for that get your questions about christmas remember that if if you get kicked off this is why you need to be subscribed here so we've got your email address and can send you uh notices wherever we go i mean what if we're going to different things we are live today on facebook live youtube live live and elijahstreams.com live so we're live in four places so if we get knocked off and one um we'll be in those other three so um i think that's it all right let's bring in kat kerr here hello everybody how you doing good good to see you merry christmas to you yeah merry christmas so you're going to ask we're going to ask a whole lot of christmas questions next week you probably heard that and we want to have you just elaborate on what you talked about christmas town all that so i'll have you just kind of elaborate on that next week so well yeah that'll be fun so listen um we'll just jump in um before we have any questions cat what kind of anything current events you'd like to share uh well i do there are there are things out there everybody knows about and things people can't know about right now but i i can continue to tell you that that foundation of the left is crumbling um there's other people leaving their positions because they're being exposed in that is privately that i can't announce who that is but that big support this is the thing when you lose your support like you were saying you can't do anything that is absolutely true but guess what it's also true for the left all the people who are jumping on that bandwagon are jumping off many of them are jumping off some of those are really big supporters and i can tell you bottom line why i can tell you why they want to have money left over because they keep being asked for more and more and more you can't give yourself to something that is totally darkness and think they're going to let you go how about if i give you that as a tip you can't do it you can run in and agree and participate with things that are evil and think that will let you go i can also tell a story about that there are people who were part of an extreme dark uh uh thing that was going on this is probably maybe 15 years ago and they actually had seen demons talk to demons and not trying to scare anybody they gave permission they gave permission and they thought what they got to do was exciting and amazing but guess what they wouldn't let them go they tormented them for the next 10 years of their life and and they just couldn't get rid of they didn't get rid of them because you can't give yourself to something it's like what god says what you enter into will enter into you and that's how simply something that's one liners of some of the most powerful things he ever says to me but what you choose to enter into will enter into your soul that's just what happens and either you think about it you want to run after it or else you give them a tie to you and these people actually gave a tie to to this these beings that were um beginning to torment them when they were done with the fun thing they thought they were going to be a part of which was dark was really bad i'm not going to tell you what that was but they couldn't get rid of them finally they had to repent and and cleanse their soul and every every place they lived they had a place that the demons would always come in at night and torment him they couldn't do anything about it so they had somebody get hold of me i didn't meet with them i told them what they would have to do and they could never ever go to that place again and they would have to just you know make sure that they got that out of their soul number one but they actually had to renounce anything or any hold or tie that darkness have with them that they gave permission to that's the difference and people who are just maybe attacked every now and then that's it that's illegal that's taken to the course of heaven sometimes and sometimes god just comes in supernaturally and ends that that's like an attack this is not what these people were doing they willingly participated in these evil acts that were happening somewhere and that's why it took longer to get rid of it they finally broke it they have had no no nothing else come they stopped coming they severed that tie they severed that portal that was open by their own repentance and then um having to take communion over the whole thing and you know what they attempted to come back but they said they couldn't they served only the living god they would not serve the enemy again so that's why it's so important to make sure you never get into one of those places or participate like that it's really hard to get rid of and that's what people are finding out now who already have been a part of this thing this year and a half long thing that's been going on in our country more and more people think i can make money if i let them use me for this or if i lie about this or if i cheat in this way i'll make money well they're finding out they're losing their money that's what's happening they're losing their money and once they make a tie or a contract with this darkness that's going on they won't let you go that's why you don't want to participate in the beginning you stand strong against everything that's going on you keep running after god right now in your life and don't forget to celebrate he's still saying that to me god has already seen the beginning to the end he knows exactly what will happen and i know there's a lot of theories and assumptions and people think they know what's going to happen i can tell you god is going to decide when that does happen when it does it will be so great you won't have to wonder if you'll hear about it so this is just a tip to people or those who are still in the darkness you better get out while you can if you don't you probably will lose everything because this is an evil thing happening in our country you cannot steal a country you cannot give yourself to satan or his evil ex and think he will let go of you if you're already stepping outside of that maybe you never got born again you better get bored again really quick i will say that you better get born again because that's probably the one thing that can save you from all the stuff you've been involved in but there's already people they've already got some people who are being witnesses um to a lot of these accounts that excuse me that are happening so i would just encourage you and i'm gonna keep doing it get out of that darkness while you can repent make sure you make sure you tell somebody who is accountable who is an authority in the area that's just looking to see what's going on so i just want to encourage people those things are happening right now people are uh they're distancing themselves from some people they're actually getting out of these things themselves but people who have money are finding that if something doesn't happen to stop this whole thing they themselves will have no money or property so let me tell you evil will never bless you evil can't create life or hope or something that's going to help there is no help in evil and darkness that comes from god that comes from belonging to jesus christ so all you who've been out there have been strong and stayed strong and given hope to people that that god does know what's going on don't give up okay you got to stay strong it says making your stand and standing there for us i just want to applaud you yeah yeah making a great stand for jesus christ he made everything we know and see nothing is hidden from him so if you think because god's not saying anything right now to everybody that does not mean he doesn't he does have a plan he he does he does have a plan for all of this that's good ken i think you said something a minute ago and i thought you know i'm going to ask her to expound on that you said people had sold out to darkness and you got them into repentance and to receiving the lord if they hadn't but then you said they took communion over that thing or something to the that effect and you're you're speaking about communion as if it's a weapon and let me just ask you to expand uh expound on the weapon of communion what does that actually do when people take communion it is so powerful and unfortunately most churches has just become a tradition yeah i will give you a good example of that i remember where i was attending at one time it had become like a tradition that doesn't make god very happy because there is power in the blood of jesus christ and his surrender totally to the father's will and even his own willingness to do he didn't have to do anything at the cross and no matter what people think don't take the crosses off your wall now that you think he's not on it anymore his own personal mark he makes as a carpenter is a cross that's what he does even in heaven when he makes things that is significant it means everything to all those who are a believer who have received the the sacrifice that christ did and died for us he shed his own blood for us that is a powerful thing in the spirit it breaks things sometimes that nothing else can and especially people if they've had things going on in their house at night maybe they may be familiar spirits or other kind of spirits if there's nothing else you can do you've prayed maybe you've fasted you need to take communion yourself over your property and then you go outside and you pour some on the land and say with the blood of jesus christ i redeem this land a shockwave of jesus christ will it tell you it will embed itself in the property you're living on and then you invite holy spirit to invade it just invite the spirit of god to invade it and let me tell you what it'll be hard for anything spiritually bad or evil to come on that property it would be too painful for them taking communion is something some people actually do every day and i do it about once a month myself at least sometimes more than that and recently we just cleansed our land again and let me tell you what the peace of god with the presence of god will infuse that the presence of god is in communion it represents many things it represents the sec reminds us of the sacrifice christ did but it's something that brings us together if you do that with your family it will be so powerful in the spirit it brings a bond with you and your family together when you take that together recognizing together as a family what christ did for you sometimes it opens things you never could get open sometimes it breaks the power of the enemy that nothing else will break i even tell people who've been sick for a long time you should be taking communion over your body it says very clearly in the bible what you know what he did by his stripes what does it say you are healed okay the blood it helps your mind and your mental faculties it just does physically mentally and emotionally it can heal things and break things off of you that never could be broken off before wow that's my you know my spiritual father wade taylor last five years of his life he was my spiritual father he would take communion every single day and i believe he sometimes several times today his and his he believed that the lord had shown him that the closest thing we have you know the tree of life isn't on the earth right now he he strong strongly believed that the taking communion was the closest thing we had to a tree of life on the earth as far as the natural you know elements that type of thing is interesting you know and he was a very healthy man until you know finally it was his time and suddenly he was gone but uh yeah that was i i've never looked at communion the same since he since he said that because i thought you know that what if he's true what if it's true that there's so much more healing available to us there is you know and i remember at least i was in at the time that they had just did it they were doing it again just as a rope thing as a just a normal thing they did once a month and god yelled from heaven to me it is holy it is holy it is holy and i'm telling you the presence of god fell so strong on me he said you will say something about this and so i wrote all this down i gave it to uh one of the prophets visiting visiting and uh they read it to the congregation like a week later they read it and the power of god fell on the entire church and people actually got on their knees and repented for not taking it for the full uh the power of god that was in it the fullness of his sacrifices in there well what what did he represent he represented life hope joy healing empowerment that's what's in that's what's in taking communion that's what that means that's profound i mean it's just so profound yeah when i was raised up but i'll get into these questions here when i was raised in a fundamental church it was like every 13 weeks we had a communion they even did the foot washing with it and all that but it was like if we could figure out a way to get out of that particular uh church service and stay home and once in a while we'd figure out something like let's go to the beach today it was it was just a ritual there was no power in it and we just looked for ways to get out boy i would never do that you know with my understanding it's very powerful here's here's the first question um this is a two-part i'll just read them both but my mother was in her last days in the hospital in hospice she kept telling me about these beautiful atriums she kept seeing i personally believe god was showing her glimpses of heaven before she passed so question when are there atriums in heaven and two does god reveal heaven to people in their last hours or moments to comfort them or to prepare them before they die um well that the last part is absolutely true some people it's their first glimpse of not just having many people in their last maybe maybe the last week especially they'll begin to see family members who are in heaven they'll just see their faces or something sometimes they might hear them say something that's not like they're going to abide there with them but he is letting them have glimpses of having something else they'll see many times are their own angels or or they'll just see angels in the room that's really a clue that they're probably not going to stay very long and but if everything jesus christ unless they walk up and he walks up to him and say you know you will live and not die or it's not your time but sometimes he'll catch them up there and tell them there and then send them back but if if they begin to tell you that i've seen jesus then that either means they're going to be fully healed or they're going to be fully healed by going to heaven and uh so yes a lot of that happens sometimes you'll give them glimpses of mansions in heaven or the streets of gold or even the throne sometimes so that is absolutely that part's absolutely true i think because their spiritual body is getting more aware and um even when it gets close to them stepping out and they literally step out of their body that's what they do if they're sitting up naturally they'll just step right out of their the physical body it'll fall back but there they are right there looking at their own body that's happened to a lot of people and then jesus would say it's not your time so they have to go back in wow there are many different things that could happen some people were here heavenly choir saying that part is very true and uh and i'll tell us i'll talk about something else in a minute about the choirs but that is true and yes uh even sometimes when people are really sick maybe they're not terminal they will see glimpses of places in heaven and i believe the atrium thing that they're seeing is probably some beautiful part of the gardens of heaven uh there's a friendly forest in heaven they have beautiful gardens surrounding that there's a butterfly there's like this beautiful meadow where butterflies are uh they actually will sing you hear them singing so they could hear a heaven part of heaven singing they could see angels i could see family members there and that does bring peace to them and sometimes not just peace some people get really excited when they when they have glimpses of heaven like that that's amazing well that's it's encouraging because as i said the number of times my mom's real close i'm kind of curious by the way regarding that now my mom's memory is going we just got back from ohio she's got now she doesn't remember from conversation to conversation a few minutes late does god let me ask it this way does god have a harder time getting a hold of someone like that who needs a little bit more of him or does he have an easier time because she's tuned out of life what would that be like for her to maybe i think it wouldn't matter what state they're in mentally emotionally or physically when he wants to make himself known or let them begin many times if we're saying they feel no matter where they are on their path if they belong to him it he already has that connection with them in their spirit when he's ready to show them something he's going to do it but normally that will begin to change that person and even if they can't remember what they ate the day before who visit them the day before they normally will not forget if they begin to have encounters and sometimes it's not like a face-to-face encounter sometimes it's his presence uh sometimes they they may say oh i feel really good right now i i feel amazing i feel such peace on me that's usually because christ could be in that room with them right there in that moment i just know that sometimes it might be a little bit easier in my thinking if your natural mind begins to shut down or your memory system the reason for that is they can't remember the things that they were angry about they can't remember things you know they can't remember their cares they can't remember their concerns they don't remember any things that were said to them or maybe things that they did that they shouldn't have you know maybe unkind words that's gone from them so that does totally open it up for the lord to begin to either speak to them or begin to show them things so this that might be a good thing well you know it's interesting you would say that i wasn't going to share this but you know my life's an open book right now but you know what what's that you love it it's so open because every millions are white i know well we went out in march and i i was thinking i was being a good dutiful obedient loving son to offer her to come and live with us from ohio and boy oh heck broke liz and i understand this is this is really what happens to a lot of seniors at this age they if you think if they're thinking you're taking their blasted i mean she didn't say any bad words but she was furious he was okay so now fast forward we just can't went out there in ohio and we were itching her along and then she called me after we we got back and and she's now she's inviting herself to live with me instead of the other i said i said well mom you you know after you treated me so horribly and she goes what are you talking about and she made me repeat it five times and she didn't even remember after five seconds after i told her she said now tell me again what i did then we found out later she doesn't even remember any of us flying out there during march yeah that does that actually doesn't happen as part of the process of just being prepared many times just to just to leave um but that's normal and you're right that's very normal and even most people when they of course if they're still around here around a heaven uh a hundred years old you you should see some of them some of them are sharp as attack but in the natural most people's bodies and their systems and the way they operate their thinking it kind of begins to shut down some uh they may be alert in every other way but their memory from like the day before whatever like she was saying to you that might be god's blessing sometimes because like you said she didn't remember even saying that yeah it feels like well i had i had actually been again here's that open book thing i was really wounded i was hurt and i kind of cared that i kept forgetting her in my heart all this time after i found out yesterday that she has no recollection i'm thinking what what how what purpose would it be to even have any hurt left what have i heard about something that she has no recollection of ever doing so it's like it just fell off it just fell off it's almost like maybe a child does something not to hurt you on purpose but it just happens you know and uh especially in the different growing years they might say something hurtful teenagers do that sometimes and it it it's part of their growing the young on the young side but when they're older it's just part of what's natural and i think that is i know people who've forgotten that went through traumas and stuff not not my family of other people had horrible traumas when they got closer to that age they didn't even remember it it's like it just naturally left them and they're happy i've also known people who like almost couldn't stand being around somebody and now they love them it's the same same people but but they really love them because the person who was holding that was gone because the memory part was gone so yes steve you can't you can't hold it against somebody who to them like well that never happened i would never say that they mean to you i never said that yeah i mean i was smarting and i can't you know i was you were hurting that hurt so anyway that's good all right here we go he goes i'm i'm finding out that my seven-year-old son is a seer what is your number one piece of advice for a young seer for their parents his sister has an autoimmune issue and he said that once while we were praying for her healing he looked up and saw a small angel about four inches tall with wings wearing a red dress with her hand on my daughter's foot praying for her would that have been her guardian angel that my son saw or a different one sent for specific purpose so it's kind of a multi-part there that probably would be a different one sent for a specific purpose but since you brought that whole thing up i i have known families who had a child who was handicapped in some way they get extra angels assigned to them just because of that what we would call a disability uh they get extra ones assigned to them and this young man now is so almost absolutely normal he has some physical things not causing him pain but growing up they said he wouldn't live they said he would never have a normal mind he would never be able to talk never feed himself and this was being fed to this young child's parents like their whole life they refused to accept that they made sure he had everybody the care that he had but they talked to him normal they didn't treat him like there's something wrong with him and he has two angels that are with him all the time besides his guardian angel and they're there because of this this handicap thing he has like i said this is like 30 years later and you know to see him he's so filled with the light of god he's a believer and he's such a testimony to people because of how he has grown in every way that the doctor said he wouldn't be alive but there were two angels assigned to him and i knew somebody else who had someone who was grown and they also had two other angels and finally i just asked holy spirit why are those other angels with him they looked different than from their guardian angels and they said oh they're sent to they they like protect the anointing that they carry they're there just to be uh yeah to bring things down from heaven to them that god wants to put into them i'm pretty certain that's what that four inch angel was that was like a little messenger angel bringing something down they wouldn't be part of the host but they probably were brought down from heaven with one of the hosts probably brought them down there so that was great as far as being a seer i would get a journal most important to write down things that he's seeing it's really important that they do that when he gets older he'll be very grateful for that journal uh like right the day what he said he saw just write in his words what he said and then anytime he comes i've already told some of my my daughters to make sure that they do that and so one of them has actually started cataloging and now this child is 10 and he's not stopped seeing things but it's very powerful to him that he can read about the things he said that he heard said or that he saw so definitely most important thing you can do is uh no matter what god ends up by doing with that gift he has it will be very powerful one day make sure you're writing it down yeah and what what's the deal with the four inch angel versus a seven foot angel i mean what would you say about that i would say possibly whatever it is that the child is um whatever it was you said that they had it probably there may be like a tribe of those little angels like that made for that specific thing that they were diagnosed with and that maybe that may be something that god sends maybe his life is in them they're they're probably putting the life of god in them oh the peace of god in them so that would be their only assignment that would be what they would be sent for probably to keep that child in peace or the presence of god yeah i guess the issue was it was she just said it was an autoimmune issue so she didn't say that so okay melanie asked how old does god look how old would we perceive him to be in earthly terms i've heard you describe kind of seeing his face but i've also heard you describe almost a little bit of a veil so i mean how do you see him you and i talked on the cruise that one time and i said are you telling me cat that you're sitting down sitting down talking face to face with the god of the whole cosmos and you just like yeah you know that should be crazy it would be like asking that question to a child that really saw something let's say your child went and saw somebody or met somebody and you maybe try to convince them i don't think you saw them they would be so adamant uh that the child like part of me there's nothing in me that could make up anything he wouldn't use me at all if he if if i did that i i'm a detailed person so i'm always going to see details one of the reasons why i see him clearly is he chose me because i have a photographic memory and i am a detailed person like i'm not going to hear just a sentence that he says i i'm taking places that i have to remember all that i saw and then they have to write that down if it's things that god came and told me personally and he said i want you to i want you to share this with people then i have to remember exactly what he said it's not like it becomes um familiar in any way i won't even use that term because the power uh the power he carries i'm sure he has to probably uh maybe minimize that a little bit just for me to be able to be around him i probably i sometimes i feel like when i'm when i'm seeing him and it's just to be in his presence i feel like i'm going to melt and go inside of him i don't know how to yeah outs to explain that the love that comes from him is so powerful and it's it's not just what i feel his appearance is quite striking if i could say that you feel life coming from him because it did we all lived there so it's like he's holding everything in him all of time is in him he didn't appear somewhere time came from him and i know i i love the one-liners he tells me to tell people they get their heads so undone they try to wrap their head around it but most of these things are spiritually um discerned i would say in his normal appearance because i've seen him like a certain way many times then there's times i've seen him with flames of fire with lightning bolts shooting out of him when he's walking against the darkness and stuff like that his own appearance begins to change it talks about the wrath of god and any believer you should know this that we are not appointed under that wrath that he was demonstrating that would be evil in darkness and wickedness that he despises evil he despise what it does to people so if he was gonna catch me up there and talk about the justice that is coming then his whole appearance would be to bring justice that would show me that that fierce side of him okay the loving father side of him which is what i see many times i know his hair is made out of light remember the father is all spiritual but he still has the ability to hold me if he wants to or i can just stand next to him i can see into his eyes and usually they're like blue flames of fire they're they look blue to me blue flames of fire but what comes out of him if you could picture um i love the northern lights i've not seen them in person but i've seen god and that's what that rainbow looks like coming out of him if you ever wondered it's not a stagnant rainbow it's not like you could just paint it around him and it would just be there and not have life and movement and i would have to say seeing the northern lights in the way that they move like this coming out of him continually and on these waves of his rainbow which he it comes from him no man made the rainbow people it comes from the living god it's part of his own appearance and his person and out of that comes these little spirits of life they'll ride on this rainbow then ride back in him that's what you used to do when you lived inside god it says in him we live we move we have our very being the prophets and poets of old have spoken of these things what things when they were shown that way in the past god would show himself to people sometimes and sometimes it was someone who was a poet and they actually wrote poems about that and so one of those made it in the word of god so that's just a part of him to see him like that the creative side where i would see jesus step out of the father and the father would say something and then he would make what he said that's why he was called the word we know in the book of john it says that we know in the book of john when john said the word was with god and was god and there was nothing that was made that was not made by him that was jesus christ that's who he the word came to the earth and died uh as the son of god and so they're one and the same the word jesus christ are the same but when he was the word he only had a spiritual body he was all spirit it was still a body i know in your mind you can't imagine you think of something like a little like a spirit like whatever you want to call it like the spirit of a person or something they're much more there's much more to them than just some little wispy thing if you're in a spirit world which heaven is and everyone there in the spiritual body they look solid in that world okay so when i see the father most of the time he looks like he's solid although he's all spirit so i've seen him with love coming out that consumes like the whole army of god before they're going to go somewhere um to bring justice for him over someone on the earth he'll literally go and just stand in their midst and every one of them will be permeated with his love he loves them too and his love and and just empowerment and and when you see that he's he is kind and he is good and many people don't see the father is good but jesus himself said there's none good but the father and so when you see there's many different parts of him sides of him uh that's who he is but i i'm always undone when he comes most of the time unannounced because what is on his heart to share i'm i'm his revelator that's what he calls me that means i reveal for him i don't reveal for a man so i'm not gonna usually i can answer questions ask me if i've been told or shown it otherwise i can't answer that i can't answer for him if i haven't been shown or told something so it's really quite undone sometimes the room i'm in like where i sleep which is in my office built this moment there's a huge portal in that room and and sometimes he would come down through that portal but sometimes most likely in the hotel room a lot of times he'll just walk through the wall like it's not there and he'll begin to tell me stuff sometimes he'll tell me to write it down sometimes he'll write on the wall and we know that even in the word of god it talks about him doing these things so for him those are normal things he does when he when he knows somebody who's going to tell the truth who will not embellish on what he what he said which is extremely significant even john the baptist had one of the greatest revelations ever given on the earth that's why they said he's the greatest prophet of all that's why that's in there he announced literally here is the son of god he actually got to say that even though in the natural he was jesus's cousin when he spoke those words he wasn't speaking from a natural viewpoint he was speaking from a divine point and he never changed as much as that he came that he came to say that you had to repent of your sins right he was one of the first ones to give that message so what he said was so powerful when he actually said here he is uh the the first and only person on the earth who could actually say here's jesus christ the son of the living god this is the messiah that was a powerful word but he never changed what he said because that's what god told him to say wow yeah and you've always been obedient that way you know almost to a frustrating point because people will ask you something i've seen it even on um what's the kenneth copeland channel i can't think of any victory channel or whatever and flashpoint and they'll try to get you to answer a question you'll say i can only tell you what god told me and then he'll launch into your prophecy that was that's pretty i've learned learned a good way um also that's part of that same question is does god the father does he look like a grandpa does he look like a dad who's older what what age impression when he leaves well i know you're wanting most people will judge somebody by their skin okay or conditioning is a skin and does it have wrinkles does it not have wrinkles does it have like brown spots and most people judge people nor in the natural you know um if they have white hair no hair i mean i i can't answer him in that context i cannot put him in a category as a human i know that i see life in him i see still even now talking you can still see his face very clearly and it's filled with life there's no age in him he's never going to age his hair is white it's alive his hair on his head is living it's not short hair it's down below his shoulders uh he has this amazing uh wonderful beard um it just you know i can't i tell people say what do you think he looks like kenny rogers he doesn't look like a human everyone fails in comparison to him because of the stuff he carries that makes him who he is but i can just say that you will you'll never regret giving yourself to his son that is the one where you are assured of meeting him in person he's excited about seeing you he cannot wait for you to get back home to heaven and i hope this gives you a glimpse of the other side of dying for you you're losing something for him he's gaining something he's gaining his son or his daughter back to himself he is so excited all of heaven celebrates when they come home so for them there's there's there's no loss in their mind uh from the time they step out of the spiritual body they're stepping right there they feel his presence they see their angels their excitement floods them you know i mean it's not like they don't love you to actually love you even more but but just to be in his presence i understand why jesus when he had to live on the earth he'd go away to the mountains to to be with his father he would go away to go be that he needed it after living here with humans are you kidding and so king himself loves the father and i think for him the greatest thing he gets to do is take us back to him when you come home to heaven he walks you up the steps of god's throne the father's throne and gives you back to him he says your son your daughter they've come home and let me tell you the celebration will start in heaven at that time but but he is not little he's not a little person in any way whatsoever but this is what i love about the father one of the greatest things i like to say about him is he could be a hundred feet tall two thousand feet tall whatever he wants to be he can be that size i think sitting on the throne many times and to me he would look like maybe i don't know 10 15 feet high he he doesn't want to make himself invisible to you if you're coming home to meet him but i've seen him holding the earth in his hands so i hope you get this picture i've seen him back in time when he was making the earth holding it in his hand this is the father when the word would step out he'd make it gave it to the father the father began to speak over the earth itself he would pour water from himself he's going to put the water on the earth he poured from his own south the river of the river of life that comes from him he poured that in as the ocean on the earth and so whatever they did they did together and so i've seen him that big to hold the earth in his hand i've seen him be you know make himself well call enormous eyes just to hold you he'll stand up on the throne and hold you to himself and i also know this about him that even though he's on the throne he himself can make himself not leaving the throne small enough to step inside of himself to play with all the little spirits of life that's who you were are you serious with you in himself while he's sitting on the throne people he knows what's going on if you think he's willing to give this earth that he loved that he spoke over to evil what do you think he didn't have and he kicked it out it got unseated lost his place lost his authority lost his power lucifer did you think he's changed his mind about that because he has not he loves you too much and this time is too important for him to give it over to evil all i know is they're going to lay down roll over and beg god for mercy when those days of justice fall upon them and for some of them it will be too late wow wow catboy the anointing hit you right there god came god came down wow wildcat cat let me can i explore a little bit you talk about the son loves the fat father loves his son and son loves the father i think we've talked about this a little bit let me drill down you know when i was raised up we'd always make sure we pray in the name of jesus make sure you say the name of jesus and it became like a a formulaic word make sure you mention the name of jesus because then god can has to do it but but is there something in when we pray in the name of jesus that we should at that moment almost tap into how much the father loves jesus as we're saying that as opposed to just making sure you pronounce jesus or yeshua what what is that go ahead and understand who you're talking about when you use this name uh and if if there's probably if you're saying it just from head knowledge this is what you want to know don't ever say his name from head knowledge okay you need to say it from revelation like what i just spoke okay that's how you should feel every time you say his name for any purpose you're having power in that name of jesus that's why it is one of your greatest weapons the name of the name of christ okay his name his blood uh his sacrifice his revelation of who he is he right now he right now is the king of glory people uh he has many other titles besides jesus christ when you talk about him as your savior and what he did for you he also gave you power over all the power of the enemy he gave us three things you see him from that viewpoint it should almost be like a threat to hell that you are saying the name of jesus christ wow wow yeah that's a whole lot different well that's what the lord's been showing me lately is is to tap into to that to him to the reality um yeah and this one you kind of answered this this is the next question but you kind of addressed this it says before jesus came to the earth and he was called the word in heaven did his spiritual body then look like what we know as his human body or what we think of as his human body or was his body more like i don't know what i don't know what this means was his body more like the holy spirit i i think this person's grasping between um a cloud like the holy spirit or the body of jesus but i i think they both have um a spiritual butt right yeah i would say when you are you talking about let me get the timing right are they talking about what jesus looked like when he stepped out of his physical body let me see when jesus came to the earth and he was called the word in heaven he was called the word did his spiritual body then in heaven look the same as his human body looked on earth oh when he was the word did it look the same as the physical body on earth that seemed to be the question no physical body changed him from what he looked like because if it looked just like the word why did not satan recognize him oh good point oh good point he did not know when he took him to the mountain temptation that was the son of the living god he didn't know that he was trying to find out who he was he was always pursuing who is he until he himself said who he was he did not know he did not know he was the word that was with god the word was all spiritual body that was his divine body a spiritual body a spiritual body like we were just talking about isn't a wispy cloud i know what they're talking about you're talking about what they've seen on tv or movies this little wispy thing steps out they can go through walls and the reason why uh your spiritual body down here could walk through a wall is that physical wall is a temporary substance it's even a temporary realm the physical realm is not the original realm the spiritual realm where the whole world called heaven was created where tribes of angels were made where you go back home to live in that place you don't pass to the walls in heaven and your spiritual body okay you have substance in your spiritual body but as far as the appearance thing the word was very powerful he could go in and out wherever he wanted to do whatever he wanted to he had no flesh attached to him the other sacrifice you don't realize he made was he was willing not just to walk and live in a physical body he had to keep the physical body wow and so when your little spirit person leaves god when you lived in god you didn't look like this okay you had a little appearance you had a face you little face you had body you could play inside of god and the river of life climbed the mountain that's in him a ride in and out on the waves of the rainbow you could do those things in your little spiritual body but you didn't look this gave you an identity okay that's one of the reasons why he wanted you to have a fleshly body number one so you could live in this physical body in this physical world and do things for him here but as opposed to the word the word look different than jesus christ did because the flesh wrapped around your spiritual body your spiritual body actually adapts to the flesh because when your throat man steps out of this body when mine does it looks the same as if i was in my fleshly body except i look a whole lot younger and so were you one day so know that satan did not recognize who jesus christ was he didn't know he was the word okay who made him actually uh satan was created he's a created being he didn't know that that was the word he didn't know at all and that that was part of the bushwhack people so that was part of the butch whack that jesus would almost have a disguise that satan wouldn't recognize for a very long time jesus could do things he wanted to say what he wanted to and and satan i'm sure was quite shocked when jesus christ you know living on the earth began to cast demons out of things that really freaked him out i'm really sure now he said okay this person's got power he's got power i i don't didn't know he had this power uh and he's not really as brilliant as he wants people to think he is because when he got kicked out the heaven part of his mind was seared by that lightning bolt i'm just letting you know so he did not know that that jesus christ was the word of god because jesus himself with his fleshly body looked different than the word and right now he still looks like jesus christ who lived and walked on the earth except for this he has his glorified body already he was glorified that body was glorified when he stepped up from hell came up from hell and stepped into that physical body that was dead laying on that slab life infused it but not just life but the glory of god infused the body of jesus christ and he walks around now in his physical glorified body in heaven so when he comes to see me that's that's who i see is the one in the glorified body and you know when you said uh this is the first time it ever clicked that we would have looked different inside the father because we would only look like we looked down because i'm a combination of my mother and my father that's the appearance i took on that's right because i had a natural mother father so i don't look totally different in heaven before god selected the family for me i guess yes he knew all along he knew you would be looking like just like you do now steve he knew everybody would be looking like that like they do right now in their physical body he knew when you were in him you were chosen at that point for some things in your life he put a little mark on you he knew i would be a prophet he knew you would make a home for the prophets to come and say whatever god wanted to say he knew that we probably knew each other we probably were friends inside of him that would be cool to know that would be really interesting you think so we wouldn't be doing so because i know those who were friends inside of god if he chose you to be a part of your lifetime uh in a significant way he would absolutely choose people that kids that you were like call them kids they all little they're all little at all like a bunch of little kids living in him and and you had i would see little kids sometimes with little groups playing with each other and doing things with each other and we we can have a whole whole just segment about life and god uh really that would be quite fascinating to find out revelation about what did you do in there what went on there what does it look like and there's another whole thing but i'm pretty sure that we probably were friends i know my husband and i were friends when we were we were part of this the little group that we had uh inside god that we played there's millions inside of him but there's no back to god there's no size to god it's like inside of him he's part of infinity and that at one time you know before he made the earth we all everyone who ever was or will be lived in him you can imagine in your head let's hope you maybe that makes you realize how powerful he is about who he is uh he is limitless in his understanding and his knowledge and in his revelation he's unlimited in almost every way he's unlimited can i ask you a a difficult question that some watching will even um it would be their question it would be their question god knew you before you were born he knew what you would look like before you were born and then there are people who are product of of either born out of wedlock in some cases rape how do you what do you say to people who say but what about me how could god have known me and allowed me to either have children of abuse or what do you say about the plan of god and what sometimes we're allowed to go through in this life i think one day when you get your book given to you that was written about you in heaven you'll understand that he didn't choose any of the evil stuff at all that wasn't had nothing to do with god at all he sent us to this earth it's an imperfect earth there's imperfect people everybody is held accountable for what they did they they there there will be an accountability uh of course when you receive jesus christ that has something to do with wiping that away but i can tell you this he sent you this is what happened he picked you for certain things he sent you to earth at the time he needed you to be here he didn't choose those people to be wicked they weren't always wicked when they were children they weren't wicked okay so everybody making their own choices are raising their children in a certain way because of what's in them and that's why i always i talk to young people a lot i've done young people meetings and i say you have to understand that you're not just going to be raising children one day you are shaping souls that came from god for his use do not be abusive i'm i'm telling them this already but you know what that's if they watch a lot of violent stuff just go into their soul and even psychiatrists know this they don't understand the workings of the soul or what the soul looks like but what you what you choose what you listen to all the time will become a part of you what you watch all the time would become a part of me and eventually you might even act out some of those things you see and that's why there's evil satan helps that to happen he makes sure it happen happens and yet there's some people who grew up in a violent household that that never part part took of that they they were strong they never allowed that to affect their life or how they lived it later and became and were totally totally different people than what that person was that had them so you have to understand god didn't create he didn't make evil happen he didn't even make lucifer satan if you go back that far let's go that far he may lucifer to be an anointed being who would help lead worship for him to create glory for him to be a light for him that's what that's what lucifer's job was he made him for that he didn't make him to be evil it says in the bible iniquity was found in him that was significantly because god didn't put that in him okay by his own thoughts by lucifer's own thoughts and own wicked desires to be greater than god and want to rule from that came evil began to be birthed inside of him before it came out so because there is evil present in this world one day there won't be any we can look at it that way but god didn't choose you to be tormented he didn't choose that those people who raised you had every right to choose to do what was right regardless of what within them they had every right to be kind to you to nourish you to nurture you and everything and know god and no happiness and joy and not have your mind tormented later in your life all the things that happened to you as a child but god didn't create evil in this earth he didn't know evil would be here but he also sent his son for the very purpose that you could be free from anything you went through you can be free from any event no matter how bad it was or when it happened you don't have to carry that stuff on the inside of you and that's why he came to bring freedom in life he had an appointed time to be here even jesus christ had to be made into a seed this is what it says christ was made into a seed he was made okay he had he was going to have flesh on him and i think on my our next um report we do i'll actually read the poem holy spirit gave me about when the announcements began to made it be made in heaven that the word would die for us that the word would be made flesh which it says in the bible he was planted as a seed in the womb of mary but there's this whole beautiful story it's called the year before christmas and what literally began to happen in heaven um you know before he was even sent and i'm not going to do that today but we'll do that next week but you have to understand god has been from the beginning to the end and no matter what you thought you could do that would be better he has a plan he was willing to sacrifice his own son who was tormented and tortured and so horribly abused wrongfully accused uh you know unjustly treated and and basically murdered he knew that his son would go through that but what comes from that and this is the thing you even though it's not god's intention to make you suffer for him his son suffered for all of us you can take your life no matter what you've been through and you can lose all of that all of that horror all of that abuse all that torment all that trauma lucifer from your soul in jesus name and jesus will come pull it out of you and it will be like it didn't happen in other words you might think about it but there'll be no torment in it there'll be no suffering in it because we can be totally free from all of the effects of evil but god didn't make people bad he didn't make evil itself and the evil one who's done this will be more tormented than anything that ever existed throughout all the time he satan will be more tormented than any other anyone else who ends up in that lake of fire satan will be the most hated being in there the most tormented and he will have no power whatsoever so you can think of it's one thing you to be in a place of torment but when you everyone is tormenting that one person and they can't escape or get away uh that is his end he will have nothing from anything he's done god also knows that he's a just god and kind loving god so you need to see him the kind loving one who gave the greatest sacrifice i know i'm not trying to cover up things that were done to you my parents didn't torment me uh but i certainly was picked on and and made fun of most of my life growing up and i just had to let it go i don't even know about losing you know i decided i'm going to let it go and go on i have stuff i have to do and i want to see done you have to make the same decision but let me tell you god does know everything and he is not it is seedtime and harvest people this is not don't get your 50 bottles of anointing oil out okay because this is not the end time harvest it talks about in the bible before all the other stuff start to happen we're not even ready to handle that harvest like that okay you're going to be powerful you're going to be filled with god when those days come but it's a seedtime and harvest for what you've been planting what the left has been planting harvest for them is about to happen what you've been planting by yours making a stand still filled with life encouraging people bringing people hope you're going to get the greatest harvest you've seen in your life so far this is the seedtime and harvest is happening now just that's for free what time is it time and harvest for us individually for whole groups of people if it's evil you're going to get a harvest of justice and and probably the rather that and while while you're talking as this as we close out i know i feel like there's some people out there that says i wish someone would just show me right now how to get saved i i like this stuff no one's ever led me to the lord how do i do that would you i sure would love to do that yeah and and let me tell you it's really uh man can come complicate things so much sometimes we feel like we don't read you know the the 50-page syllabus or if we don't have someone who's like known god forever lead you even a child can lead someone to be born again you make a decision in your own self that you want jesus christ okay you're tired of what you've been living in you're tired of the junk going on in this world you see no hope if you don't have hope right now you may not have a lot of god in you because right now he's releasing hope in life when you are born again literally your your soul gets a shower of the blood of jesus christ to wipe away every sin you've ever committed no matter what it is when it happened in your life if you want to walk as righteous if you don't have jesus christ you're unrighteous okay you're not counted as righteous if you want to be counted as righteous you're going to be part of god's plan what he has in this earth you need to know his son jesus christ you first of all recognize that jesus christ is the son of the living god he did die for your sins and he did it purposefully he chose to do that so the first thing you do is repent of any sin you've ever committed no matter when it happened or how that happened re repent recognize that you are a sinner and you repent and you receive jesus christ as your savior that's the first step that you do that the second step is you thank him for dying for you thank him for your sins being forgiven and it will be like in god's books in heaven when you receive christ he literally will go and wipe out in his books every sin up to that point every one you've ever committed will be wiped off like you never did them that's how powerful the blood of christ is then you say i receive everything that that blood affords me i receive everything that that sacrifice that affords me i realize now i'm part of god's family i'm a part of his family i'm not a i'm not an old sinner set free by grace you are a powerful born again uh believer now jesus christ will literally step inside of you that's what happens he'll step inside of you it says you invite him to live in you and he will and then you begin to feel his presence miraculous things will begin to happen because now you're carrying his presence with you and anytime temptation comes to you after that make sure you say no i'm not that person anymore it says you're born again you are a new creation and the reason why god can say that is none of your past sins you're not being looked at anymore by a sinful person you're being looked at as god's son or his daughter whichever one he made you and now he opens doors for you to understand him more make sure you get a bible i would encourage you to start reading the new testament read the book of john and make sure you study the book of john as a lot about who jesus was also talks about what what it's like to be born again and in in there it's real exciting and then make sure you speak to him you need to know that prayer is very important for you you don't just get you know born again and now i'm saved and live your life like he always lived it i'm not saying you can't stay at the same job or live in the same home you'll have the same family but you need to recognize now you're a new creation made by god because of the blood of christ you begin to seek him and what does that mean get in a room by yourself and say jesus christ i want to know you more i want i want to know you i want to know what your heart is i want to know what your thoughts are of me and i would say i i used to do it at one point every day of my life i did that usually late at night i'm not saying you have to do anything late at night and this is the thing some people say you have to take a certain posture it's okay if you want to kneel to do it you can be walking down the street and get born again you can get born again arriving in your car he's looking to know you more he is seeking you harder than you are seeking him so the most important thing in your life should be to receive christ and then begin to pursue to know him more and then you start on a whole different journey in your life the inside of you has changed your spirit man god puts light in your spirit your spirit man has light in it it gives it more understanding it gives you more of his presence inside of you your name is literally written in the lamb's book of life he'll write it right there at that moment that you get born again and so powerful things happen in the spirit when you are born again so i would just say just you can say a simple prayer so let's just say this you can say jesus christ jesus christ i want to receive you as my savior i want to receive you as my savior i recognize we recognize you are the son of the living god you are the son of the living god you came to this world to die for my sins you came to this world to die for my sins so i repent of all sin so i repent of all sin up to this moment in my life up to this moment in my life i ask you to wash me clean i ask you to wash me clean with your blood with your blood i receive your sacrifice i receive your sacrifice and i now thank you and i now thank you for making me part of the family of god for making me part of the family of god i give you permission i give you permission to speak to me to speak to me whenever you want to whenever you want to i'm going to seek you i'm gonna seek you to know you more to know you more your word says your word says i seek for you with all of my heart if i seek for you with all my heart i will find you i will find you that will be my pursuit that will be my pursuit i celebrate right now i celebrate right now that i have been born again and i've been born again i

upon you during this christmas season so without any further ado let's bring on kat because we have so many wonderful questions i don't want to waste any time so welcome kat hi i'm excited about today's show um and i love your shirt she was showing it to us a little earlier so yes there you are santa and jesus doing selfies in heaven there they go okay it's so it's so cute and so i know everyone's excited about today's episode hearing all about christmas town um but before we start do you have any current events that you want to share with us i just want to say some of the greatest things ever about to happen people um you know i can share but not share all of it i just know that things are rumbling in the undergrounds not just the earthquakes but uh behind the scenes and then covert places the solicitor's covert i can just tell you the new norm will be better than what it was before people it's not gonna we're not gonna be controlled it's not gonna be a time of sorrows we are not entering into the perilous times we have way too much stuff to do in this earth for jesus christ and of course you know this show highlights him also but it highlights one of his best friends in heaven his name would be nicholas so that's about it let's just get going with those questions yes awesome so the first the first thing i want you to just tell like a brief um a little bit about what where christmas tower is and what is christmas town for the people who haven't heard you talk about it before christmas town is actually a place in heaven and for those who don't know me um you you may not be able to wrap your natural mind around anything that i say because it comes by revelation revelation comes from the heart of the father it's not man's thoughts man's ideas are man's plans it's god's and so i've been taking on tours of heaven not just once but many times and before you start you know beating me up i forgive you i forgive everybody out there so don't waste your time doing that i have too much of a life to live for jesus christ but i do want to say this years ago kenneth hagin senior has somebody working for him who actually still on this earth her name is billy brim and um and he would tell billy brim before these days are over uh things that will begin to happen he said i won't be here this kenneth hagin senior speaking to billy brim who worked for him okay and uh and he said to her before these days are all over something great will begin to happen god will begin to catch people up to heaven and taking them on tours really those are his words and then bringing them back to earth this is without dying so they can share revelation about heaven and that he said that to billy brim and when she found out about me she was so excited she called me i sent her my first book i think i sent her the second book too and she said she knew this was true because years ago kenneth hagin senior who's now in heaven uh had told her this would happen and she saw that i was taken on tours continually she knew that was the truth so there's somebody right there who's an eyewitness that god had this plane all along i just happened to be one of those people i've been taking in many places in heaven over the last 20 some years and i was taken to exciting profound places that were so filled with awe and wonder but has also taken places to have fun and the father said to me why would i not have fun if i said in my word you know you must come like a little child he said i'd be in a lot of trouble if i didn't have fun places for people who are like little kids to play in and one of the places i was taken to is a place in heaven where it snows all the time now i know a lot of people are going to love this more will love it than not it snows all the time but you have to remember i'm talking about heaven not the earth the snow is alive everything in heaven has life the plants sing the plants talk the birds the creatures even the buildings shout out the ground shouts out all the time and worships jesus christ they have a place called the friendly forest you can go and have conversations with trees with the rocks uh with the creatures there's so much life there you can't escape it so i hope that under makes you understand in in christmas time when you go there that is where nicholas lives yes nick some people call him saint nick some people come saying you call them whatever his actual name is nicholas and god created a place he knew one day so this place has been around don't go into the druids and all the stuff that it's a bad place and it's part of this thing this thing i'm sorry but god was there heaven was there before anybody was born on the earth he had places already planned in heaven that he knew that we would love to come there and he knew people would come home and use their gifts in heaven which is what you do so nicholas had a place all prepared for him when he passed to come nicholas lived in the 3rd century i think 270 a.d that's really close you know it's only 270 years after christ died so everybody was still talking about him knew about him in those days but of course you know our enemy satan wasn't happy about that so he'd always send people out into the crowds into places to talk against the deity and the person of jesus christ so nicholas was actually this is the person who people then made him become like santa claus he actually was a very wealthy person he lived in turkey you can look all this up even i think wikipedia talks about it he lived in turkey and uh he would offender of the faith and i think he was even a bishop but he was very fierce when people would attack the person of jesus christ or speak against who he was he had a staff he would use that staff for things other than leading his sleigh how about that people he actually had a sleigh he would take gifts to children he used to set them outside their home at that certain time of the year and then thieves would begin to come by and get it so he is the one who actually started the whole stocking thing the parents would hang stockings inside and nicholas would come by and leave gifts for them this is the truth i'm telling you and so all that came the wonderful story we have now but i do want to say this he lives there he loves the snow it's known where he lived on earth and so god created this beautiful place when you make a snowman in christmas town in heaven it is alive so i kind of want some of the christmas songs and the things that they say uh your sleigh can go through through the air it can go on the ground uh there's all kinds of things to enjoy there ice skating and i i learned from the father that our seasons on the earth are here there's four main seasons and we know that there's winter summer spring and fall and god said i took a a shadow of an actual place that existed in heaven i took a shadow of it and made it a season on the earth so that's one of the reasons why we have snow on the earth because it is in heaven it was there first and so he made this beautiful place it's like this beautiful village and everybody goes there with their families who are in heaven and yes everybody gives gifts but then excuse me the main thing they do in christmas town is they celebrate the birth of jesus christ it's like happy birthday all the time in heaven because people go to there to see sometimes jesus will show up and people will bring him gifts they pile gifts gifts you know at a place for him but they get gifts before they leave christmas town because they're huge trees in christmas town and all the lights on the trees are baby stars like that he plucked out of the sky put them on the trees and they all sing worship music to jesus but they also sing christmas songs so this is a delightful place that the kids will love to go but even big kids you know parents and whole families go to this beautiful place and they really enjoy it so that's where nicholas lives he made this place where nicholas has a shop he still makes toys and my brother recently passed and he used to say all the time when i get to heaven one day i'll work with saint nipple guess what he does my brother would create toys on the earth every single christmas he would dress to santa claus he would go give gifts away he'd visit places to be be that person of course the honor of jesus christ in his heart more than anything else and i want you to know nicholas himself loves jesus christ and that's why therefore the shirt you know here's a shirt right here with santa and having doing selfies with jesus and so people people just love some people live in christmas town i mean that's where their mansions are and so it's a really fun exciting place to be wow that's so awesome i can't wait to go and see that myself and all the all the kids questions um i asked i even asked my daughter this morning i knew i was coming on with you and i i said to her her name's lily and i said lily if there's one question you could ask what would you want to ask and she thought for a while she had a couple questions but um michael could you pull up i i put a little video of her asking you uh can we pull that up hey mrs cat um where where is eva's favorite place to go in heaven jesus's favorite place to go in heaven would be christmas town it really is he visits here a lot he actually makes toys with nicholas he goes to his shop because you have to remember jesus was a carpenter on the earth uh when he actually walked on the earth and people go well he built houses he built furniture he made toys too uh jesus loved children you could see all through the new testament that he would be with the little children he said don't keep them from coming to me he loved he loved to talk with him and play with them but he would make toys for them too so guess what he's using his gift he had on the earth in heaven he also loves the snow he loves the beauty of it and everyone loves to see him and they all run want to run up and hug jesus and guess what they take pictures with him in heaven how about that uh they do have a way to do that you think people are taking pictures down to earth where do you get to heaven one day so i would say definitely christmas town is one of his most favorite places oh she's gonna love that um and annabelle is eight she's nine years old and she wants to know if you paint a picture in heaven can you hop right into it and does it become real that's what i remember some of the movies on the years that were made people need to understand all those great movies the decent fun ones a lot of those places are in heaven i'm not going to give you a list of some of those movies but but we all know that there is one that shows something like that happen there's so much creativity and as i said everything alive is in heaven just to give you another idea uh there's a whole place called the galleria where all the artists come now people would think oh you know that would be like rembrandt or somebody like that no anybody in heaven who has a gift you paint or loves to paint there's even a whole section for children and what they paint does come to life now before you think in your natural earth head there's nothing wicked there's no bad there's no witchcraft no darkness no evil none of that is in anything anyone does in heaven it doesn't even exist there so your thoughts your creativity is not ever tied to the darkness so you understand that but fun excitement you know those type of things definitely yes your art would come alive but not only does it come alive there if you are an artist in heaven you have a gallery of your own you have a studio that's part of your mansion people come to get the art you create and you give it away now when they take that art home and hang it on the wall guess what it comes alive oh my god so so she actually thought of something that really does happen in heaven not just in the galleria area where all the artists come but in anybody's home they'll come by no matter what you create or make that's your gift you give it away there's no money everything is given freely but how delightful for somebody maybe sees a magnificent horse picture and they take it home and hang out and all of a sudden that horse is galloping in the picture so yes that is exactly true it does come alive and not only can you jump into your art there's a place called cartoon village in heaven that he also made for children and when you go there you can create cartoon of movies with your friends and then you become a cartoon and you jump in the movie the cartoon and all your friends can come and see and watch it and when it's over you step back up and then you're you again so i'm telling you people that think kevin is boring they don't know very much about it so you were absolutely right yes you can jump into your artwork and then you're there in the art wow oh that's exciting annabelle i know you're going to be excited about that so think about what you're going to draw when you get there annabelle because you're going to be able to to be part of it okay the next question is from evangeline and she's four years old and she says can i have a rainbow house with rainbow things in heaven hi evangeline of course you can it is heaven um mansions are made out of almost anything that you can think of but totally that rainbow comes from the father it's living it moves in and out it's on a lot of places in heaven you yourself can become rainbow color if you want to the clothing you wear changes color so why wouldn't you be able to have a rainbow house i would say yes that would definitely be a yes oh that's that's exciting my daughter's gonna love that too evangeline because she always talks about i want to ride on the rainbow i want to slide on the rainbow and i think i've said in heaven i bet you can that's always how i answer in heaven you can and then michael is age eight this is my son and i asked him to ask you a question and he said can i have a house made out of candy oh no everybody every child wants their house made out candy and the best part is you can eat it and it comes right back uh because it's heaven there's a whole place called jello land in heaven it really does exist and then part of that land of course there's there's houses made out of candy they're made out of all kinds of things uh flowers a whole house made out of flowers and they sing to you all the time when you come to your mansion and uh but candy is one of the most favorite things i know there's chocolate waterfalls probably would be a part of that mansion made out of candy uh you can just go jump out in the waterfall and drink the chocolate or swim in the chocolate and so yes and in the jello lamb part of it people will reach out and they'll take you know a bite of the house or take a handful the house need it then it comes right back you can bounce in the jello land houses also and uh but the candy house i think is a great idea it makes me think of that game candy land so let me tell you i will say this jesus christ does have a soft part in his heart for sweets he loves sweets and so he'd probably be right there with you you know tasting the chocolate or the candy canes or whatever else was made your house was made out of so the answer is absolutely yes you could have a house made out of candy oh well he's gonna be really excited about that because that is his question he's asked me many times cat he said do you think i can have a candy house and i said well with the lord all things are possible so i'm sure yes you can yes that's absolutely true now we're gonna we're gonna move uh now to questions from adults so they're a little different than the kids questions i have i have noticed that um so the first question is from illumination and she actually um is behind the scenes here and she wants to know my grandma went to heaven in 2019 and she absolutely loves christmas even her memorial service was christmas themed is it possible that jesus would give her a home in christmas town because she loved it so much on earth i'm sure he had started building it your your mansion gets started being built when you're born uh when you're born he starts working on okay now in heaven there's no time so it's not like wow was that 10 years 20 30 40 50 years and usually he times you're coming home to heaven with your mansion being done so i promise you he already knew what she loved you know he sees and hears us on the earth i assure you that he had already built that house in christmas town knowing her love for that so if you want to visit her when you get to heaven you will be going to christmas town probably going on sleigh rides she might come to your mention and pick you up in the sleigh and then you can go see her mansion a lot of that type of things happens in heaven so i'm sure yes that she lives in christmas town oh that's awesome well there you go elimination she we talked a little bit behind the scenes and she said i feel like the answer is yes but i i just want to hear from cat what what she has to say about it so paulette is our next question and paulette um asks does heaven celebrate jesus's earthly birthday yes can i hold up something you can zoom in on it and i'm just gonna show them this is a new product not we've already been selling about a hundred so it's not about buying it but i want to show you uh how much they celebrate the birth of christ this is a scene i actually saw in heaven now this is part of the scene i might show you the artwork for the rest of it in a minute but this is a scene in heaven of a little girl uh who lives in heaven and she's riding on a sled with the snowman she built on the front of the sled actually says happy birthday jesus because i had already said that everybody celebrates the birth of christ in heaven and so here they are on their slide you might have to tell me if i can can you see it yes can you see the little the girl the snowman her pet is also there and there it says at the bottom happy birthday jesus so yes they do celebrate the birth of christ in christmastown and uh and everybody loves to come there's one of the reasons they actually do come there they all sing happy birthday to him they have non-stop cake people was gonna get cake in christmas town and hot chocolate you know and and other things like that you're definitely going to experience that but but it is the number one place people would think it would be some other place maybe religious place but nope this is where he chooses and i know people it may not have been exactly december 25th but he loves for people to celebrate his birthday and also created christmas towns so people would be able to go there to do that [Music] and in christmas town today is there um a big christmas dinner uh constance wants to know this and it kind of links with the last question is there a big christmas dinner in heaven for christmas and why do you um we do it on the earth many of the things we actually do and the holidays we celebrate they already celebrate those in heaven and absolutely you're going to eat and people can eat all they want to there's no weight gain no no allergies no food allergies and so absolutely how would that be to celebrate during that time what what represents the time of the year why would there not be a feast yes there is definitely a big feast the good part is this no animals life is taken god makes all the food out of light but it tastes like turkey it tastes like it tastes like ham it tastes like pie whatever you love to eat but they certainly have a a non an ongoing feast in christmas town wow that's awesome i can't wait to eat in heaven i know i've heard you talk about it before about how big also isn't the food really big in size there oh yes like the pizza place that was taken to a place called pizza joe's in heaven and the pizzas were the size of the table it was sitting on now this was a round table this round table will seat about eight people now when i say the word table don't think i'm talking about just a normal table that's not like that it's filled with light and you have like your your plate or you can eat on slides out in front of you and then you just point you you eat a slice of pizza it's about this big i can't even get it i can't even get it the pizza slice is so big you have to hold it with both hands to eat it it was the best tasting pizza i had ever had in my life and right next to that is an italian restaurant where the meatballs are like [Laughter] and the guy who the guy who has that he had an italian restaurant on the earth it was his gift he loved to cook for people he has a chef's hat on he has one of those handlebar mustaches and he's really really happy person so yeah i've been to like an italian restaurant the ice cream parlor oh my goodness the the scoops are this big of the ice cream and you can even create your own kind of ice cream in this ice cream shop and then they change and they add a name to the um the menu up there what you can order and you can you can name the ice cream yourself wow that's so awesome and i know i i love to bake so i'm a big baker and i thought when you talked about christmas town how the artists where um they give away their paintings is it the same with bakeries like we can make really huge christmas cookies and then give them away to all our neighbors oh yes you can they'll probably be lined up outside you can give away your baked goods and i know people they say i don't know what my gift is and yet oh my word they like to make the best brownies on the earth and when are you kidding it's going to be making brownies you know they love to do it they love to give them away as gifts uh people who are blessed on the earth are the ones who who get to operate in their gift now and so uh they they're used to do that but in heaven nobody misses their true destiny god sent us all as a gift with a gift it wasn't not talking about a spiritual group talk about a natural gift that everybody can enjoy and uh and we know people who sing they're singing amazing that's their gift people in sports they play really well that's their gift but there's a lot of other gifts gifts there's like design you know or baking i can tell you that that food and baking and stuff like that is considered an art in heaven that's awesome i can't wait to bake and and i bet the the machinery there is like incredible too like huge mixers times 10. yes it's incred the thing is is now if you want to have a bakery that will be part of your mansion you don't have a place where you live in a place where you work and it's not work when you love it right so you would go to your mansion to visit your bakery and all your good you'd have a showroom with all the food there you had made and yes they do have kitchens in heaven if you want one now if you're gonna be a baker you're gonna have to have a kitchen you probably have people a sign that that's their gift is to help in that um unless it's one of the little tiny angels that looks sort of like an elf and i'm just gonna get bash for that but i don't care uh there are ones that you have little helpers assigned in heaven if you have a bakery because you know you know if you got a half a million people coming to get your goods you need help yes and so it's a whole different life because i've seen the kitchen of someone who loved to feed people her dining room seated 100 people and it was a dining room in her mansion and in her kitchen had such high tech i didn't even know what some of the stuff was this is one of the best parts about heaven if you choose to cook i saw this woman making a massive salad that was going to be served to all of her guests and she was peeling like a cucumber and as she peeled it in the in the and it came off of the cucumber it disappeared there's no waste there's no trash there's no cleanup how about that isn't that awesome hallelujah there's no cleanup no garbage to take out people there's there's no waste dumps and having to leave stuff it just disappears and um that's like back to the waterfall chocolate waterfalls you can get in and swim around you have chocolate all over you but when you step out of it it's gone so but the food thing in heaven just amazed me that everything you eat is made out of life but your substance i know people think well light is something you can't really touch or feel and heaven it is it's the number one thing that things are made out of in heaven actually your spirit man is made out of light but you don't float around like a little cloud in heaven you walk on the streets you use your stuff in your mansion you ride the horses uh it's an actual life it's a literal life in heaven wow that's awesome well i'm excited to go and cook in heaven i'm telling you that i've had that deep within me where i'm like i can't wait to cook and bake and give away my stuff in heaven because that is your visit your place yes please do please everybody come visit me please okay um elaine elaine wants to know can you describe how jesus became a seed and was planted in the womb of young mary that's awesome there's actually a story the holy spirit told me one time it's called twas the year before christmas and i'm just going to share a little part of it i'll probably have it printed out later on there but it starts like twas the year before christmas when all through father's house every creature was stirring yes even the mouse there was so much activity like uh maybe um earth time a year before that when it was being announced that the word who was christ in heaven the word was going to be sent to earth as a baby to be raised up to walk among the people here and then one day would give himself for them so i don't know if people even think about this they think well they're just supernatural they just fly around do whatever they want to do oh no there's much planning in heaven and explaining in heaven because you have to understand the angels were there long before we were put on the earth and so there was all kinds of activity in heaven all the time they'd be sent on assignments places throughout the cosmos and things so much activity going on in heaven because people were on the earth you know people were living on the earth at the time christ was born and so the father had to take the word and explain to him this is the plan this is the plan i have for you you will have flesh on you number one the word was all spirit but like i explained in heaven that's like a whole different realm the spiritual realm to a spiritual person would be literal like i'm touching this like i'm holding this cup right here see in heaven if you had something to drink uh you would also touch the cup and drink out of it even though it's a spiritual world uh it still had life and activity and there was building going on plans being made talking about people who had just come home to heaven people getting to greet them so but heaven does like to have a lot of celebrations so this was a different time when the father called the word to see him and explained to him talked to him he said would you be willing to do this he asked him we know it was it was at that time it was a father the word and holy spirit and when the father would want to create something when there was nothing he would go somewhere where there was nothing he would speak what he wanted the word would step out of him and you have to understand in the spiritual world the father the father son holy spirit can step inside of each other that's what makes them one the three in one so they would go places together and i'm thinking the word probably thought oh we're going to go create something but the father took him aside and explained to him it's time now for hope to come to the earth and therefore my plan is to send you as a baby to be a baby on you to be raised by a wonderful mom and then one day you would grow up and then you would give yourself for the sins of the world and i'm quite sure because i know we think well they know everything the father really does know everything because everything comes from him and this was his plan for man to help man to help man on the earth they needed help okay uh the enemy who satan was wreaking havoc everywhere he was just getting people to fall into darkness and the answer was to send the light of the world which was jesus christ so he did explain to him he said i will take you and i will make you into a seed and holy spirit will take you down to the earth hover over mary and plant you in the womb of mary and i know people don't think about this too much when they just read the word but you should really study the word it says in there that he was planted in this as a seed in mary and later because we know man carries a seed i won't get into all that normally the man carries a seed and then you get married then you have children but this was totally different uh this was a supernatural divine thing that happened that the father took the word who was his son made him into a seed the holy spirit hovered over the womb of mary and even talks about it in the bible and then she he was he was planted as a seed grew up in mary was burst into the earth as a real being he had flesh on him okay why did he have to have flesh so that people could see him because on the earth normally you don't see spiritual beings unless god opens your eyes to that spirit realm which is also all around us so he had to explain not only to him what he was going to do he had to take all the tribes of angels and explain to them this is what is going to happen it's going to be different now it'll be different because redemption is coming to mankind the word has said yes he's willing to do this and then he will be known on the earth as my son who one day will give himself they were totally they were undone because this was something that had never happened before i know when new things happen on the earth people think oh that couldn't happen or that won't happen but you know heaven has been through many things like we have there was even there was kind of war one time in heaven that was when satan tried to take over and he was kicked out in a lightning bolt uh so they've experienced that all of that happening so this was new news even for them a new revelation so now the word was being sent to the earth would be not not recognized on the earth because when he was the word he was a spiritual body and he's going to have flesh on him so he'll look different and they could watch from having to see everything going on so yes on that beautiful morning nine months after the holy spirit hovered over mary and planted that seed uh jesus christ and then he was born into this earth such a celebration in heaven took place um that the host came in saying to the shepherds gabriel came to announce his birth i'm sure there was quite a sight uh you know here on the earth to see this all this activity going on it was very major for the father to give his son as a gift to this world and that's why god loves it when we give gifts just so you realize christmas time on the earth is so precious to god it represents us loving one another giving gifts to each other helping each other you know making a difference bringing hope when christ came as that child he began to bring hope to people everything was going to change about when you pass from this earth you could go back home to heaven having received christ as your savior so this is one of the best gifts ever given to the earth would be jesus christ the son of the living god and he was raised just like you and i had to be a little baby learn to walk and learn to read and write and i do know this about jesus he loved reading when he was being schooled on the earth he didn't care too much about writing and i love the holy spirit he said that's why there's only 10 commandments instead of 20 because he didn't care too much about writing that's a joke in case you didn't get it so anyway the star coming several years before the birth of christ that the wise men came across the deserts and some people see them in a little play here's the three kings they were from different countries they saw the star of christ in the east so they traveled east from the desert regions from three different countries it took them two years to cross those deserts to come and bring the gifts to to to jesus and i don't know that he was living in the manger at that time they did come to honor him recognize who he was so even people on in other countries knew something special had happened and so from that point on jesus lived his life walked out his life on this earth so that he could become our sacrifice and what he was doing was making a way back to the father so i will say this the day you pass and you step out of this body and you're going home to heaven jesus will come get you he's the one who walks you up the steps of the throne and says look father your if your son or daughter your son or your daughter whichever one is has come home to you that's part of the blessing that christ gets for having given himself for so but it was all a stir in heaven all these people these these creatures and these angels and the host of heaven the army they were all talking back and forth non-stop did you hear the words going to go to earth did you hear he's going to be a baby uh that sounds to them that was like sort of wild but they knew when the father said something it was going to happen so all of heaven prepared for this to happen things were repaired on the earth people were put in place there would be a part of this whole story of his birth how they had to travel they were told they had to travel to uh you know be accountable for who they were and register and that happened to be in bethlehem how about that and god had already placed his star in the heavens to be seen uh two years before this happened so that's the true story of why we celebrate this time of the year is because we celebrate the birth of jesus christ who came for us because he loved us the father loved us the holy spirit loved us and this is their plan for you for i for every person in the earth god desires that none should perish but you have to choose jesus christ to live in this beautiful place this world called heaven that is the father's house that's beautiful when you talk about jesus walking us up the stairs back to the father i mean that touches my heart so deeply because it's i can just imagine that and the beauty of seeing the father and just the love that must come and washed over you as you're with jesus and seeing the thought oh i just can't wait for that day oh you're already undone that that jesus christ is with you you hear about him people have encounters sometimes i already got the spirit of god all over me right now you hear stories of people encountering him on the earth and i can say i have seen him many times but it is never normal i'm so undone every time consumed by the love that just comes from him it it just permeates every part of your body and you forget about every care you have you're not you're not listening so much to all the stuff going on right now in this world god has a plan for this world okay it says the earth is the lord's and the fullness thereof this earth belongs to jesus christ he paid a price for it and he knows what's going on let me tell you there's stuff that's going to be exposed i can just say get ready for some great great days ahead no matter what the enemy thinks they're going to do god has a plan to be in some of the greatest days if you're young you have the most powerful amazing future ever on the earth to do great things for him the creativity will be so powerful and amazing people will be shocked some of the stuff will be created on the earth to help us our life to be better and and happier but the number one thing that will happen is the presence of the lord is about to consume this whole earth and the knowledge of that glory will be seen and known all over the earth hallelujah i feel i feel that so strong when you talk about that it's it's going to be an awesome time it's awesome time to be alive uh there was some there's someone who asked a question about i wanted to find it real quick because they asked about the oh the shepherds here we go sally asked about um what happened to the shepherds to whom the angels appeared 30 years later did they connect with jesus um the baby they had seen or did they always wonder what happened to that baby have you seen any of those shepherds in heaven um i'm sure the shepherds made it happen i will tell you this they never forgot what they saw i mean here is one of the one one of the archangels appearing and gabriel is beautiful he's so glorious i'm sure the sky lit up you know the sky open person lit up and here he's given this glorious announcement you know that this messiah is being born the son of god has come to be amongst mankind and i can tell you that i will say this too that where it talks about the great host appeared the ones that sang were actually part of the army of heaven okay and you know it says in the bible that the shepherds were afraid they were so afraid that their body hurt now they weren't going to be hurt but they'd never seen anything like this so you can imagine warring angels coming with gabriel to sing and to glorify christ's birth on the earth that's actually what actually happened and so they were singing i'm sure it was really loud but it was beautiful and so you think you saw just one angel you'd never forget it but here you've seen multitudes of the these armies of heaven and gabriel and the seraphim probably were there singing their heads are like blue fire blue fire their hair is so can you imagine this site and i know no one has been there and has not seen it doesn't understand i was taken back and i actually saw that scene i saw what happened because he was using the army of heaven and i'm like no wonder no wonder no for me because i see i'm a seer i see the army of heaven around me all the time i see their activities i see them you know battling the army of darkness and how badly they get beat the army of darkness gets beat but so i'm i was accustomed to seeing them but seeing the sight the shepherds were cowering behind rocks or bushes their eyes were so wide you know here's gabriel making this beautiful announcement and then here comes the army to sing in the heavens and and it's the lights just like blinding from there so you can imagine they probably repeated that story over and over again to everybody they knew probably they probably didn't believe it but it didn't matter to them when you have an encounter you never forget it so i'm quite sure because jesus did teach over in that region he taught over there there was jerusalem and other places there i'm sure some of the shepherds probably eventually lived in um in jerusalem i mean it wasn't that many years now he was in there he was already known as a great carpenter joseph taught him as a master carpenter so jesus was known as the carpenter the son of joseph but we know he was the son of god uh so he was known because of that but but when jesus turned 30 he began his public ministry that means he started demonstrating the miracles the signs and wonders and i'm quite sure it made it back to the ears of those because this spread far and wide that said i'm sure that some of those who were in bethlehem or maybe relooking in jerusalem they probably knew exactly who that was when he started talking about being the son of god i i'm quite sure that there are some of those shepherds are in heaven yes wow that's awesome i i can imagine that you went got actually got to go back and see that whole entire scene that's incredible oh my god i can so if when i get to go to heaven can i go to a place to watch that scene too yes actually there is a place they have um they actually have theaters in heaven how about that now again i have to always explain you don't have to have ratings like r for rotten pg like partly good g for good uh you know i mean they actually they they know what goes on here so any of the theaters in heaven again there's no darkness there's not going to be profanity there's no no uh you know killings none of that no violence whatsoever so there's no dark witchcraft none of that is in the theaters in heaven but they have a place where you can go uh and you can actually watch when god made when they made the earth you actually get to see him creating earth by watching it but it's not like a screen it's like you're there wow oh my gosh i can't i cannot wait for that um there's another question about um renee asked this question and i've heard a few people ask this question before um i'm seeing a lot of christians fighting about celebrating or not christmas is that a spirit of religion trying to stop the celebration of christ's birth i think it's partly that i think it's partly what we've been taught our whole lives in church you know depending on the church you go to because you know there can be 50 churches to probably hundreds of thousands of churches right now and i tell you i tell people no matter what church you go to make sure they're teaching about the validity of jesus christ who he is he's the only way to heaven i think it was that but i think totally satan any chance satan god to draw people away from the truth that's the bottom line satan doesn't want people to have fun joy celebration but he does not want them to have the truth because the truth sets you free so okay this place in heaven was created before the earth was here so you can't say that christmas is some pagan holiday sorry people okay the pagans weren't here when god made it in heaven however there is someone who lived in heaven saw all the beauty the wonder and the fun and when he was thrown out of heaven he created wicked evil things and said that was his symbol that was his celebration their lies i'm not saying there weren't these wicked groups on the earth doing things but satan stole different things in heaven to make them look like they were bad so christmas town belongs to god he decided to create it no human hands made that place because it's a place of fun of splendor a place to celebrate his son it's in heaven he loves it when we celebrate it on the earth and you know what you all need to go get can you get me the dvd real quick jen i'm going to show you really quick a dvd i would encourage everyone to get and watch with your family it's called saving christmas it's right there by kirk cameron actually got really tired of listening to the very thing you're talking about he got tired of all the insults and and and dragging you know christmas down saying it's a pagan you shouldn't have nothing to do with it so he went to the word of god got all the scriptures and wrote this script for this movie called saving christmas it is hilarious but it actually shows you nicholas back in the time when he walked down the earth where that came from and he actually explains why christmas is so important on the earth like i said it's the only time some people forgive each other it's the one time they reach out and give to help others even people they don't know and we watch this many times and so i'm just going to show you the cover i already heard from kirk cameron's people saying thank you for showing it it explains everything and i think you can get it on amazon is that where you got it janet amazon so i'm going to share with you right now here it is it's called saving christmas by kirk cameron and he explains why the christmas tree is important are the all the balls the lights on the tree what they represent and you know representing christ even things like the nutcracker what that represents for for heaven for heaven on the earth and why do we eat why do we celebrate what does all this mean and he shoots down every myth or reality of what evil has tried to take over he explains it the best of anyone i've ever heard so i will encourage people get that dvd let let yourself watch it with you and your in your family it's the best explanation i've heard i can just say christmas even now people are having more hope than they've had in like almost two years uh hope is flooding joyous flooding through celebration i know most people pitch or sell heaven is nothing but a place where you bow down to god all the time part of the way we worship in heaven is enjoying things he put there that's our gratefulness for what he gave us even in heaven so heaven celebrates it doesn't have funerals there's no funerals there's no firing squads there's no death certificates being made out no one's crying no one's grieving in heaven it is a celebration of what christ did for us by coming to this earth walking as a man showing you the right way to live what righteousness is what unrighteousness is but i can tell you what there is a copycat enemy our true enemy enemy is satan i know he uses wicked people to do things and then he makes up all these occults and all these things i don't even understand don't care about because i'm not a part of that and i choose not to participate or read it or watch it i feel myself with the light of god with his word what his plans are but i can tell you christmas has always had the presence of god on it when you attend church celebrating the birth of christ the choir singing represents the angels that sang on the day of his birth of some of the most glorious songs ever made or created were ones about christmas because in those songs many of them talk about oh holy night hearts and heart the herald angels sing and so all these beautiful things came out of this one beautiful holiday it's more than a holiday it's actually a way of life that's what it is so yes i celebrate it i will celebrate it now i will celebrate in heaven one day it brings families together but the gift giving is one of the big things i know man has commercialized it and i'm not saying you know go go get a gift for somebody it's a wonderful beautiful thing to do maybe help the poor with something you know that's one of my favorite things to do also but christmas is dear to the father's heart he made it not a pagan not some satanic group even satan didn't make it he just tried to steal it and he lost amen and what this is a perfect this is a perfect question to go along with what you just said um there's the user it says username because i'm happy they asked a question um what can we give jesus for his birthday to show him we love and honor him i'm gonna move my scarf over there yo i would say he loves cards and uh what i do if i want to make a card out for jesus i actually make one out to him and i put it on my tree i mean you don't need to put it even in a card you can make him one i would say he loves the kids to draw pictures you know maybe christmas trees or gifts or something like that just telling him that you love him thank him for coming to earth to be the way to make a way back to the father he loves it when we sing christmas carols especially ones that talk about the holy night and away in the manger he loves and actually watches many of the events put on by churches or groups that show that scene back in the way back in the day when christ was born and they have someone be mary and joseph and baby jesus and then they show you know if they're really big ones they bring live animals in but he lost to see the celebration in our heart so i would say the best gift you could give him would be celebrate the holiday help people love them and remember why we celebrate it it is about funny gifts and you know the joy but number one it's about a child being born in the manger a king the king of this world who created everything we see and everything we touch and he's very much a lie right now excited about this time of the year so i'd say make a little note telling him that drawing a little picture hang it on your tree if i was a parent i would save those somewhere in a special box one day and say this is what you did to celebrate our king jesus oh that's beautiful uh there brandon wants to know is there spiritual significance when people here on earth light up their homes with christmas lights do people in heaven light up their mansion in a similar fashion for the sake of christmas they have lights everywhere i can tell you if you think that you've been driven somewhere where they have a lot of decorations and things everywhere in christmas town even outside of christmas town they all have some kind of lights because it's celebrating when the angels came and the sky lit up with the glory of heaven that's actually what those lights represent that's what they like they represent on your tree on your home you're making a statement i celebrate the birth of jesus christ i celebrate with him in my life that i belong to him and i'm recognizing that i'm standing with the promises he gave me so i would say definitely put lights up we put lights everywhere we can uh the other thing one more thing in the and jesus just said to me now that sounds wild he said don't forget the cake it is celebrating my birthday why not make a cake and eat it so i can come and see you eating the cake we actually make a birthday cake for jesus on christmas and at our christmas dinner we have a birthday cake for jesus and we sing happy birthday to him even though he doesn't need to have that done he loves it so don't forget to have cake or cupcakes or something that your children can be a part of and celebrate with him at a time when he had to change his whole life and even who he was just to come to this earth for us so we can sing happy birthday to jesus on christmas and make that part of our family tradition with our kids so that they're always raised knowing that it is that's why we celebrate that's a great idea to do that as a family for all you moms with young kids that's a great idea we did that growing up and now we still do it even now we still do it so definitely you're recognizing him you're you're honoring him by recognizing him that he is so special he's worth making a cake for besides like i said he loves sweets i didn't get to finish that when jesus was growing up as a child he loved honeycomb it was his favorite thing it talked about it in the bible him and honey but john the baptist his cousin also ate honey and it was the sweet of that time that would be like eating cake you know in this day and he still loves sweets and every time some new baker comes home to heaven he's going to visit their shop uh he loves his squeezing he'll probably visit you if you make sweet sweet i was just making a half cake have cake and celebrate the birth of christ oh that's awesome well we have one i think we can get through one more question um christine asked my dad went to be with god recently and he loved to feed god's cardinals my dad loved how the snow and the cardinals looked would my dad be feeding the birds in christmas town or are they all over heaven birds are all over heaven but i have seen i don't know why they just look so beautiful people make ornaments with the red cardinals and i think i know they're around normally other times of the year but i just think they're represented if you look at i got probably probably 20 christmas cards at least that had red cardinals on them i'm not kidding like with the tree with the snow and everything in it i'm sure there are birds there because the birds come to sing happy birthday to jesus too and so the birds will come in they'll go out they'll come in but i have seen red cardinals in heaven uh in christmas town and other types of birds too but i'm sure that they will be able to see birds in that place singing to jesus oh that's beautiful well thank cat for all the questions today i mean they were they were some awesome questions when i was reading through them i was like oh my gosh these are all you guys did an awesome job sending in christmas time questions i enjoyed each and every one of them so will you just pray for us real quick before we end uh this time together and just bless everybody that's listening sure um i was gonna show one more picture and this represents sort of like the army of heaven coming with gabriel making the announcement um this is the star right here if you can see if i can hold it right i'll put the star you see the star or not yes is it right side up yeah there's the star of bethlehem there's gabriel making the announcement but the army that's with him is not normal and you can see some of them look like creatures and they're singing so the shepherds would be down on the ground you know trying to go like oh my gosh what is that and what is that up there in the sky uh whenever it says host uh in the bible they're talking about the army of heaven and so uh yes many of them came to sing because you have to remember jesus name was the lord of hosts so this was his army coming to sing about his birth on the earth along with gabriel and so i had to show that real quick picture but i will pray father i thank you right now for blessing everybody in this wonderful time this wonderful season on the earth god don't let legalism and religious mindsets set into people that they don't think you should celebrate it's not about fun it totally has always been about fun the sacrifice of your son was one part of his life but his birth was totally different great celebrations were taking place in heaven even mary and joseph and those who were present with him they were celebrating and knowing he was the son of god coming to this to this earth so father i thank you that the reality and the presence of jesus christ will flood everyone's home everyone's person at this time of the year god let love consume any fears any concerns about any cares you know jesus came to take them away i thank you for recognizing his birth recognizing who he is but also remember the celebration part that they celebrate in heaven on earth as it is in heaven thank you god for blessing each and every person if they lost something let it be given back to them seven times over as your as your as one of your followers i thank you that we're entering into a holy season of the glory being released in the earth thank you for giving us a measure but right now let sometimes their house light up without any lights on it let the light of god come over their face father it says that we will shine like the stars in the heavens i thank you that we're here for a reason we were sent that our birth was timed on the earth to be here right now to bring hope and life and joy may the season be filled with people relationships being restored uh homes being given father stuff being redeemed for people this is the time of year you love you chose for your son to come to this earth and god the date and the day is not important the recognition of it is so father let people let go of things they need to let go and enjoy this time celebrate this time that's what you would want them to do so i just impart that to them right now the life of god the love of god the plans of god to walk in this earth to bring hope and help and healing in the name of jesus for jesus with jesus because of jesus it's all about him amen amen amen how can people get a hold of you cat if they want to follow you um i know we have your

hey happy wednesday december 29 2021 about two more days uh after today for this year which we'll be happy to say goodbye to at least as far as some of the things that went on but we're glad to put those in the rear view mirror you know not that god was taken by surprise by any of this he saw it all ahead of time he knew what was going to happen he wasn't shocked or starved in fact i'm going to ask cat a question about that when we bring her on in just a minute but a couple of quick announcements for the next 90 days give or take uh when we do johnny eno and he'll be on tomorrow live we

so for today and tomorrow we're going to go ahead and keep this donation link on the top you'd have to type that out or and then there's the mailing address too we're not going to do that all the time but but during these last couple of days with people reminded that oh you have to get my year in tax giving and tax receipts i want to get it postmarked by by december 31st or i want to get it donated online so we appreciate that very very much it helps us a lot there's quite a few people i think as we get into the new year we'll bring people our staff on again and introduce you to everyone so you'll see who we all are so all right i think that's it let's bring in kat kerr hi there kat how are you doing i'm doing great good so you just said you're taking a little bit of vacation so you're back from your vacation started to do the show and then back at it well my vacation is i get a hotel in the city because i have to come back and forth here all the time so it's not like i'm a way away that's but still you know i'm away at the nighttime wow nice nice family visiting and of course right now we're not out of our our offices yet so there's really no place for anyone to visit me here so just go get a really big nice hotel room and get them some and we all can get together and do things that's what we do good good i have a question that i will open with when we go to questions but before i do that um anything you want to talk about current events or anything going into next year anything that either the lord's showing you or what to expect i'm going to throw that to you because we haven't pre-talked about this i don't know if you have anything so oh i do absolutely the father's been talking to me the last few days now you have to understand when he talks to me he talks to me like it's already done when i say already done i mean his plan at the completion of his plan for america his completion of his plan in these days for the world so he talks to me it's always positive it's always powerful and that's why i'm able to release that to the people but i want you to know even though it looks pretty bad in certain places there are things still happening i mean i i think probably the number one thing i notice and hear about a lot is how many people in the country this country america are standing up against the left i'm not going to say much more than that in unexpected ways and they they didn't ever think this would all happen i know you think it's all dragged up they thought everything was going to be over a couple months like they'd have us and our whole lives would be over that's what they had planned but the devil always forgets that we have god in us and this is god's country and he doesn't know the mind of god himself satan does not he doesn't even know your mind unless you speak it that's why you need to be careful what you're saying with your mouth that's good a lot in the atmosphere around you you actually create an atmosphere around you who's going to be in that atmosphere and so make sure it's not all about doom and gloom and fear and stuff like that i'm not saying that kind of thing thing isn't real but you do not have to choose that so i can tell you god does not choose it he's talking about the days of glory more than he ever has before to me because he said everything is beginning to be like dust and i know you probably don't understand that as a spiritual a phrase that means everything you're living in now or having to be confronted with now will become like dust and in spiritual that means that will be hard to see hard to remember what that was like so when things do happen on god's timeline because everybody's talking about different timelines or calendars or whatever i go by god's timeline and if you could be taken to heaven i'd probably ask him to show you his own timeline that wouldn't take you forever because then you would know number one you're not at certain times that people are saying right this is not the perilous times it is not the tribulation and stop saying that the antichrist is on the earth he's not on the earth people the antichrist spirit is which is a whole different thing but he's not here yet okay he's not going to sit around and wait for several hundred years to do anything satan however is trying to do a big takeover right now which will fail miserably embarrassingly i'm telling you what they won't want to talk about hell and these times are going through because of what is about to happen they won't talk about that part he probably won't allow them to mention what a huge fail it was and trying to take over this country and i don't even have to mention names or right or left or anything to tell you that i'm telling you from god's plans the days that are coming of greater glory major changes will begin to happen probably in the first quarter i can tell you that much and the first quarter of 2022 uh which is some of god's great plans to be revealed in that time and things major things to begin to happen and whether it's about certain presidents or not certain presidents fake or real or whatever god himself is going to start doing things in the first quarter of this 2022 i'm extremely excited about it so i want to encourage you you don't have to live in your soul but every wicked terrible thing you're hearing or watching hopefully you're not i do want to add one thing or this is glorious news i happen to know actually literally that these big networks are way down in their viewing by 25 or 30 percent wow yeah that is good they're even this is on the secular channel this was talking about this which i i just heard about you know literally heard about from another news person that they're down like i i can't mention what networks but you know all those who've been going along filling people with lies they're down by the viewing many of them 30 percent 25 which is unheard of for major networks because they won't stop saying the same thing people are tired of hearing the same news hey you network you're supposed to be able to deliver the news unbiased to give us great information about many different things get out of your box get out of your rut you're stuck in a hole you may be covered up with dirt one day that's good this is the for real this is a for real does not is some kind of a spiritual kind of a thing out there in the natural world this is really happening for the first time on network reviewing they they're so they're they're filled with fear and they're really very upset that people aren't watching them anymore but they're fed up with what they're getting that should be a clue yeah for sure for sure okay let me ask you this because you said something and i want to see if i heard you right you said when things began to happen which i think you were referring to when god starts doing what he's about to do you said it would be hard to remember were you saying it's going to be hard to remember these bad times is that what you were saying yes that's a huge thing that's a huge prophetic word right there it is it will be very hard to remember and even in the past when people went through things and i've said this before but i don't mind repeating myself because god doesn't mind repeating himself to me he says things almost certain parts of the day now he's continually saying things to me not just to keep me encouraged but every time he speaks his frequency goes in me and you want people want to know why are you so fear sometimes why do you why do you just get loud and yell because he's yelling because he is so he knows that he knows that he knows if anyone else does he does this is what's going to happen not what they're saying is going to happen the new norm will be living in the glory manifesting for god who he is in this earth to the point where people want believers to be their friends wow wow is that going to begin to go on you will not even in your soul have room for the past stuff that you went through are these days which everyone's going to realize at one point it was all a fake even some of those who were part of it god removes things sometimes off the earth in the atmosphere even in the spirit realm some things are just wiped out and i can prove it in the word of god because at the very end of the bible it says the former things will be remembered no more there you go well he's the only one who can do that and i'm telling you what he's going to do that somewhat as this whole thing crumbles and falls and you need to go back and look at the november 4th report people of um was that 20 20 20 21 no 2020 if it's november 4th it's 2020. yeah yeah yeah yeah go back and see that and you hear exactly what's gonna happen guess what he has not changed his plans just like when he told noah build the ark it was 120 years later people now aren't you glad you're not noah we're not waiting 120 years for things to not just go back the way they were they there's no way they can and we don't want them to want to be greater and more powerful and more known in god's presence more on the earth and creativity and inventions and joy and celebration we've been more on the earth than they ever before so you can't even say i want to go back we're going forward we're going forward into the news that he has for us uh new for america new for places in this world but i can tell you right now he's not concerned he's not there you know rubbing his hands or anything yeah he knows what our beginning is he knows what our end is and it's not the end of ends okay that's good that's good cat let me ask this question you brought this up before a couple times we've mentioned this on the air but it's a long time in between where someone was writing to me the other day and she said it was so hard because all of these things kept happening bad and i can identify with that because after a year and a half of doing this give or take um a little more than less give or take but you see even when i try to never watch the news some gets in it'll slip in or i'll see something on that net while i'm working or something like that but the to the to the untrained eye it looks like worse and worse and worse things are happening but you said once this wickedness has been here all along god is just uncovering that am i saying that right you're absolutely right and almost any time god's going to do something really great on the earth the first thing he does is expose what evil is there you can go back to the bible with the old testament new testament that's happened over and over again but people who don't study the word like study i know people read it but if you study the word of god you would see and you look for certain things in the word then you would find out that whenever something god is going to happen the devil shows up to make people believe it's a lie there's no way this can happen i'm taking over you know you won't have a chance you won't have a life he's done that and not just in this country the devil always does that and that's what he's doing now only now you know his little ploy was take the whole world right now i'm going to push this whole thing through i'm going to bring the heat like satan could do it i'm going to bring the perilous times and the tribulation me and that's my big time i have news for him the tribulation won't be his big show it's going to be the greatest downfall he'll ever have ever for a thousand years after that he'll be thrown in the bottomless pit i would say that night would be a big show for him so even that's not if god's already got that and he knows what's going to happen at the end of those few short years he does have which is several hundred years away i'm just going to keep saying it um nobody knows the day but god god hasn't told me today but he has told me his generations and generations away that's good you're sitting there in fear that your children will have already having a rough time but your grandchildren your great grandchildren what is it going to be about so bad then they won't be able to live no this is the opposite it'd be so great the darkness won't be able to survive very well or work very well because of the power of god being operated in the earth so yes um what was the question well you did good on that uh let me ask you this there was a time i don't remember i have a suspicion that it could be this time period but when god first told you to declare let the show begin and then it's like the glacier on earth i don't know if he used that term but when did when did he declare that to you and what was going on in the earth at that time that was when um the show began was right about the time when well i'll have to say the t word when those elections started the first time okay the first time it was probably when i can go back and look because i actually have someone that recorded and it might be fun actually to release those cds just so people can happen to hear what god was saying because it really didn't start stuff back then yeah i didn't know any of this was known god already knew this stuff would happen but he knows how it's going to end and what will happen why is god allowing this so he can wipe out the platform of evil that is right now trying to control us you can see people go well if this wasn't here we'd all be doing fine oh no don't use the word fine say powerful because if evil wasn't present to control your every word every movement and dictate to you as a dictator what you were going to do what you could have what you couldn't have you don't you you forgot sometimes i think what freedom really is but what's coming is the greatest freedom we've ever had in this country wow that's like everywhere and he did say that i remember even the places i was in uh if you go back and look at um i think it's called what's it called jen not activation ministries anymore if you go back and look at yourself gateway i'm not zion and this was back in 2014 i think probably 2014 2015 um was when he began to say let the show begin and also i was in uh also in missouri saying that some people didn't want me to say that they weren't sure you know who would win in 2016. and yet he did win in a landslide yeah before that when god said let the show begin that show began actually in 2016 when those elections happened that was the show beginning wow all that you're in guess what all of this going on right now i got to just move the spirit the holy spirit's going like this drama king people yeah drama he's ahead of this whole drama it is a drama and you're all a part of it so you know what you sit in the sidelines and you cheer him on you cheer on god the show has begun the show of what it's like a big movie playing in heaven because to them it's happened of of god coming into this country laying his hands on it turning it red for righteousness and also for what is right yeah he's only touched it too late they can't come in their little black evil cells and and think i'm taking this and here's the power of god in the life of god laid in our country that's what they're trying to walk on and run on and let me tell you what there's going to be some slipping and falling like you never saw before because when it begins to rise up out of the ground this is how the spirit realm works when that begins to rise up it got laid on our country and he laid it down and like the beginning of 2016 and he was telling me to say even louder let the show begin that was his show this is not satan's show wicked man show this is god's show wow it's got comedy it's got excitement it's got drama you see all the drama it's got exposure in it for the evil uh it is a big show and it's not like it's a joke it's really real i know that but if you saw god's viewpoint the show has begun and it isn't over and guess what at the end is victory and celebration so god talks a lot about that's why i talk about victory and celebration you know celebrate and eat kate eat little pieces and i already tell people we're gonna have a glory diet when this is all over that's good so when you've been to heaven multiple times hundreds and hundreds of times have you ever seen the lord rubbing his hand saying man i don't know if this is gonna work out never once never and i have i mean i have seen when i say them that's the trinity okay when i've seen them they laugh a lot yeah i'm not laughing at the devil good laughing at the devil who thinks i have everything he's always saying i got it now that's what the devil says i got it now i got it i sort of like i don't know whatever but he hadn't got nothing but fair because he is the biggest loser that ever existed i think he must have been branded with a big l on his forehead that'd be interesting to see that because he thought listen if this person is dumb i mean i don't use a word lightly if he's stupid enough no intelligence almost left in his entire head who lives in heaven with the trinity and thinks he's taking over do you think he's numb enough and stupid enough try to take over the earth i would say yes he probably is he has not any marbles left in his head whatsoever um i think the demons play marbles with him or something i'm not being funny i'm being serious wow because something happened when he was kicked out of heaven part of his brain did get seared by the lightning bolt you can't be hit by a lightning bolt from god lightning in heaven is blessings and love he was kicked out of heaven with a million megawatts of love on that lightning bolt and ever since then was planning and planning to take this earth and now this is what robin and i heard robin say a little bit the other day that that satan was making his move to try to push it when he said push it push it ahead of time right like perhaps time people it lives in god it comes from god here's the one you thought he was going to take over kicked him out right he has no seat there no power there whatsoever and the only power he really has over us is what we give him or allow him to take or we participate with him those are our family members let's go this is still the show this is still the show's going on and now i'm telling you what the angels are sitting watching except not the army the army is extremely busy yeah to our fam our family members who have gone before uh we you said many times about they they are allowed to look down to portals to see special events weddings and births and parties and things like that whatever god allows them to see do they know about this stuff that's going on on the earth at all or are they kept from knowing this what what i'll tell you what they've seen they've already seen the show steve oh really how so we've already seen the show many times he will actually show them if there's a movement going on in the earth there's a time that's his time on there she shows them the end already in heaven so they're not up there going oh no what's going to happen to them they're up there celebrating and saying you know like go holy spirit go god go jesus they've already seen the end of that show that we're in right now okay that's really good all right here's a question i'm going to skip forward to number five so if you're watching this illumination she and i share the same list this kind of taps into what we're talking about and then a woman named debbie asked what's the difference between the kingdom age which i think the lord announced to you on uh 2012 and what's the difference between that and the millennial age do you can you describe it because they sound similar like the kingdom age and the millennial age people would think those were the same things so what's the difference no they're not the kingdom age is where we actually we as the body of christ operate in that kingdom that christ always talked about it is a spiritual kingdom you operate in spiritual power and authority it's all connected to heaven but it's our operations on the earth so when jesus takes over the millennial age it's a whole new age and actually the kingdom age goes all the way up into the into the millennial age where some people say are not it's not going to happen well you need to go to heaven and see god's timeline all right because i do know what will happen no this is us walking in power and authority on the earth because of christ with him uh changing and shifting all kinds of things because he wants it done and needs it done until the day when of course that that battle happens at the end of the kingdom age at the end of the kingdom age which includes the perilous times the tribulation at the end of that time when satan is bound and thrown in the bottomless pit for a thousand years christ takes the throne in the city of jerusalem in this natural world and rules as king of this world that's the millennial age so this is uh walking power and authority the kingdom age is a whole new time on the earth because of the revelation we have an understanding of who we are we will begin to shift things for god and i'm saying i'm not going to give the fullness of that yet but we were walking upon authority not having any fear of the enemy crushing darkness pushing it back operating with the army of heaven it's our time to shine it's hard time to do that for him at the end of those days will be the millennial age where christ himself will be sitting on the throne he won't need us to do that people yeah and the 2012 am i right was that when god announced the kingdom age 2012 yes yes we stepped off a threshold of time and we stepped into the kingdom age in 2012. okay and i i told people on this show before my uh spiritual father way taylor who's gone home to me with the lord was telling me that in 2012 that we had entered the kingdom age and i thought where is he getting that you know well he obviously received it from the lord he's been caught up in heaven himself so he said that and there was a uh older man who's now gone to be with the lord arthur burt there's a arthur burke with the k arthur who's the older one he began to prophesy this in 2012 that the he talked about the the flaw of the spirit that would not even ab again or something and he probably was 2012. so there are multiple people you're not the only one in other words that got that this is when we entered the because i have you you're wrong people in africa someone in africa wrote a book saying it's the kingdom age and they didn't fully understand what that meant they weren't shown into the future the kingdom age they knew god was saying that and that was also in 2012 i didn't even know about them so i had gone to the middle of america and declared this for god that we have stepped because he was telling me to do that so i did that we're in the kingdom age right now people which means we will understand fully what christ meant when he talked about the kingdom the gospel of the kingdom he was talking about the gospel but there's a whole kingdom that comes with that that's your power that's your authority that's your dominion because of belonging to him you have you operate in that kingdom and you're over the darkness so all this exposure of darkness has everything to do with that there's different things he will have god will have happened in the kingdom age first one understanding you're in a new time and then he sets a new person in place who will begin to bring the greatness here and then even though there's a disruption god knows all this and then he he had you know that people were understanding there is great darkness in the earth because before most people were ignoring it we were sound asleep we thought you were sounded asleep let me tell you yeah we were sound asleep we didn't know that the child trafficking was actually going on that the human trafficking was going we didn't we we literally because and whenever we brought up people would say that sounds like a big conspiracy theory there's no such thing no it was not a conspiracy theory yeah wow i mean that's huge in this year that we're in 2021 i think more people in the body of christ have awakened than have ever awakened i don't know if they're fully awake i don't know if we're we're fully awake yet in fact i want to segue into this question regarding cocaine we're in the kingdom it's getting intense now the lord already knows what's going to happen it's already done in his so are there things i'm not asking you to tell me what you shouldn't tell me but are there things that the lord has told you about the kingdom age that you're not supposed to release yet and maybe what are those type of they're not saying tell me if you're not supposed to but what are the why would you why would he give you stuff to say no don't release this yet oh i do know this that the revelation that he has given that we will operate in will totally change everyone's life yet he said it will change the way the body of christ operates so it's much more major than just an individual life being changed during these days uh it's not just waking you up this is what he said you need to wake up stand up and stand out so that's what's coming that's what he wants they need to wake up but they need to stand up that means stand up and say stuff and then when you stand out that's you operating in the power of god so he's letting me tell you that much he always has like a process or a wave a protocol that he does things god is not without protocol and planning okay he does do that probably more than anyone so the whole plan for this is happening now is for people to wake up and go wow there really is evil there's wickedness and it does want to take over and and he's showing people this is what people would live like in some foreign countries they do live like this they have nothing it's often taken away they're controlled they own nothing that is the plot of satan being worked out by man by wicked man satan can't take a throne right now himself and do what he'd like to do he can't do that so he's still using humans to do his dirty work that's all i can call it he's using humans who participate and say oh yes i want this i'll make money i'll be hell have power and he'll make them even feel powerful i'm talking about satan but he has no real power as far as god is concerned and he shouldn't have any power over us at all so what's going to happen is when god begins to do certain things you begin to not just wake up you're going to stand up and start saying stuff like i'm talking about taking authority declaring things to happen in the atmosphere and places in the earth that's what you should be doing it's wonderful to know god is here and yes he is he he is in control he owns all of this but he wants you as his representative as his son or his daughter not something else in between uh taking authority that you have a right to take because of christ and so what's coming next is the stand-up thing many people are waking up they don't know what to do i'm talking about believers right now right right dude they don't know what to say you know should i say be quiet or say nothing your voice power in it you have such power in the spirit realm because you have to remember you see with your human eyes right the physical realm you don't see unless you're a seer the spiritual realm when you say something what happens in the spiritual realm is satan's plans begin to get crushed from the spiritual side when they begin to get crushed by things you're declaring and taking authority over that power is taken away from the humans who are operating in wickedness this is why it's so important to understand who you are that's what spirit forces which is why i'm not gonna say everything yet but i'm telling you you will fully understand that's the stand up part but the standout part is really those words so stay wake up stand up and stand out that's god's plan for us in this time wake up realize this stuff has really happened it's really going on but you shouldn't have fear if you're a believer you have authority over it where in the kingdom in the kingdom of age so this all going to flow together and you know what it'll be almost like breathing one day steve when they wake up they're already declaring and saying things they're stopping things in the natural because of what they're saying in the spirit realm that's good that's how it's going to happen so wake up stand up many are starting to stand up they're actually saying things against what's going on and i'm not just talking about taking things to court going to the media who will listen but i'm saying they really begin to stand up and where they live and say things that they're not agreeing with it that this is not god god's got great plans it's important to say god's plans so important if you hear a bad report always give a good report you have to give a good report from god god has us under control we're working with him we're going to see his hand move for us but we have to stand up and be on his side and we have to say we're on his side okay it makes the difference in the spirit realm around you and what's in your own soul is very important so the stand up part is recognizing in your own soul man this just been flooding in i'm getting all this negative stuff out and ask god to put stuff in you can say god i i choose my will to bind to my soul your love your authority the dominion your will your way what i have in christ when you say those things he'll flood your soul with that which will kind of wipe out which is part of the dust thing if you come like that it begins to minimize the impact in your soul and the way you think of what you choose because to minimize that when you ask and bind the things of god to your soul yeah let me ask this about you until this whole wake up season in these last few years i've always been taught that when things are wrapping up it'll get worse and worse one world government elites globalists will appear and they will begin to try and take control and now we're in the midst of the kingdom age and you're saying it's not that time yet so but we know right now cat that there's elites out there i'll just use the word elites or globalists they would rather just control everything and make the rest of us you know serfs and slaves and whatever so is god telling you during this kingdom age that whole elite thing is going to get tamped down destroyed wiped out or just less influential what what are we expecting god to do with these globalist elites who are trying to control us i know that some of them well this is what he said lose their power lose their money and lose their voice okay and you know and and you don't know if it's you're not saying if it's because here's what i'm one of the reasons it's in my mind is when i've when i'm asking this question you said before there's going to come a time when if you want to sin you're going to have to go to a city where that's uh probably because there'll be righteous cities where there's just almost no sin if i am i saying that about right there's yes there will be glories of uh realms of glory cities of glory regions of light it's called regions of light steve and regions of darkness that's what god called okay regions of light will overwhelm the regions of darkness in other words there'll be more regions of light where people will go to live in because of the presence of god sickness this is god there'll be no sickness in those cities wow wow that's so this is why this is why this all has to happen it has to happen so we understand you have to see the division there's so much gray and god says gray is where people don't know or don't care there is an area even in the spirit realm there's those who are in the darkness those who are in the light and then in the middle is a gray area where people can't make the decision or their play back and forth in the camp because the camp of darkness came from the enemy or his camp the camp of righteousness is the camp of light so there's regions of light okay and regions of darkness you'll have to live in the regions of darkness do evil i mean the crime will be outrageous but there will be almost no nothing that is counted as illegal in the regions of darkness wow they can do any kind of perverted awful horrible thing because it'll be pushed back when i said god said crush it and push it back that's what will be happening in the spirit realm crush uh the enemy out of whole regions and push them back until they won't be able to just go into some they won't want to go i say better i'll say it better holy spirit yeah they don't want to go into the regions of light it'll be so painful for the demons to go into a region of light they won't be able to function yeah and what you're describing huh well what you're describing yeah i'm really focusing on these regions of light because i'm saying gee is is the lord saying to his believers his kids of you know children of god is he saying look i'm giving you all of these righteous cities throughout the earth or throughout the united states live in any one of them that you want and you will prosper and you'll you will be no sickness is that what or will some people some people it doesn't sound like your people are being called into regions of darkness to evangelize them but maybe that's maybe that's just my i think that would have to be a very special people that have very special people um the why for the reasons of life is to magnify god's power and glory and i can tell you when it spreads it says it will be known around the world if there's only one way that happens it's not going to necessarily just but by spoken word it's going to be by the activities of the saints of god and i love to say the saints of god because people are already bashing you know nicholas and saint whoever don't you know in the bible we're called saints that's right is that true stephen that is true that's right to the same welcome person if you belong to jesus christ you are the saints of god this is not what this whole thing is about but i just couldn't help but put that little thing out there well you know it's just so well so you're saying that it would be the right thing for christians to find regions of light and just move there well i think it's going to be created by the saints okay okay the glory when these these waves of glory will come to consume us you have to understand i don't we don't have time even in this short segment to explain it all i mean i know robin knows so much he tries to but he can do one after the other you know we do it once a week and that's great because god wants people to be focused on that and again i have to thank you and i'm still going to say people you need to give to elijah a list of elijah's streams because you would not be getting this broadcast you would not be getting powerful revelation and it's nice to have head knowledge about the word and head knowledge what people researched and looked up and seen but revelation comes from the heart of god it doesn't come from me at all okay the 12th grade education that doesn't come from me i can't make it up i can't even think it up the things that god says revelation is one of the most important things you will get that's when it says man does not live by bread alone but by every word spoken by the mouth of god that's revelation he speaks and his prophets speak it but sometimes other people in the five full ministry sometimes everyday people will get revelation but the regions of light and darkness they won't happen overnight just so you know that there are some things that actually will be a suddenly and begin to change right away in this next year it's going to start to change right away but what will build he's building on is he will have regions of light and i was shown those regions of light that's why i can talk about it i saw this whole city the light coming from it was amazing and thinking god you're really in that city this was in the future he was taking me he took me there and i and he said those that's coming from the saints of god who live there that's my light in them operating and living there permeating every structure the ground the atmosphere and he showed me a line of cars coming down 95 who had they had sick people in their cars or even dead people in their cars and i don't do this right now and they were coming to a region of light when they pulled over the line that was the boundaries of that city the people came to life i'm not making it up they were healed instantly or they came to life where's 95 by where is this that you're describing is that 95 runs up the entire east coast all the way from the furthest north all the way down to miami the i-95 interstate 95 wow wow and i saw cars backed up so far and they were bringing people to a region of light that's incredible where god was because they gave themselves to god they had no sin in their life and so stop telling me you can't sin and stop making excuses by saying we've all sinned and come short of the glory might as well keep sinning well you know what you know what you forgot the last part of that sentence what is the sin he's talking about all have sinned and come short of the glory of god that's what he's talking about you're talking about being an old sinner and just sinning all day long he's not talking about that right he's talking about the glory have you made any creativity for him have you used your life to bring glory to of god in this earth that's going to change because we'll know him so well and be in his presence so much and be used by him because we said yes to use us you can say yes i want to be a believer and repent to jesus and get saved but if you want more you go after that more you go after the more but what is coming in this country i know i saw it there will be one day regions of light where people will go to be in that presence of god they'll be consumed by the presence of god if they want to sin they'll have to leave yeah so when you think there's not going to be a change we are not going further into darkness right now it's being exposed god said what is exposed can be taken down yeah so he's so you're so all of these wicked things that we're having is not people's eyes being open so they can see how far we are now going downhill it's not that he's exposing this so people can stop the evil cooperate with god is that what you're saying yes you need to choose what god if you're a believer i'm talking to believe okay the world the secular world is going to be influenced by whoever you know i'm sure they're there's some let me tell you this i have to say this there's more right now living in this country against the darkness whether the believers or a secular world are good moral people they're not necessary believers they need to become believers but they don't want what's being dished out to us that's good probably close to 80 million are against all of it which is the majority of this country but the other side it can't sink in their own minds are seared it talks about your mind being seared you can't think normal so those who have said yes to the wickedness and evil they can only think that they can't even think what is good that's why they can't plan anything good why can't they play any good there's only darkness in them so god is exposing to you all of you it is present this is how satan operates he comes in in certain ways to try to take what he wants he'll always find people somewhere he did way back in the days of noah and ever since then he can always talk people into doing wicked things if they if they have greed in them and have anger or hate or whatever he will go after those people to use them to be leaders but we who are already in the light who are filled with christ can speak against those things i'm not saying you have to go to the doorstep and do it either but you shouldn't just be repeating the horrible things as being said by those people you should be saying what god says he's exposing the darkness it will be taken down he will clean a platform so that we can operate freely in these days of glory coming on the earth he already put part of the glory in the foundation in the very ground you put his hand on it and put it in there so when it comes from above and beneath guest is going to get caught in that smack i can tell you he's got powerful plans he's not ignoring us he is working out his plan and there will be nobody escape there's been a part of all that kind of controlling they won't escape and he assures me of that all the time justice has actually already been sent he's just waiting to release it and that's interesting can you elaborate that a little bit more you said it's been sent so it's here but he's not um initiating it somehow he's not anytime god will send things many times ahead of the time it's activated and it's waiting so you can't see those who are waiting to do something because these are spiritual things okay but i can tell you the spiritual realm is the main realm it's the primary realm not the physical realm yeah the super the spirit realm supersedes it was here before it'll be here after this physical realm so in that spirit realm with how god operates but he uses physical being here just a minute yeah go ahead and get it while you're taking that and um well i don't want to interrupt that thought so go ahead he uses us to carry out things he wants done on the earth so if everybody starts citing oh listen all i can listen to stop listening to the bad stuff people i'm not saying ignore it i'm saying say something against it yeah i get up in the morning i begin to declare the day i declare the day i take authority every day over anything trying to interfere in my life to kill steal or destroy to attack me in any way to take things from me that are mine i command the host to pull down strongholds that's what strongholds do they build their self around you to do something against you but he's given that the army of having to pull them down you can't see him you can't walk up and take something in your hand so some people think it's not real it's more real than you are it was here before you were wow wow go ahead go ahead and finish that well he really is right now waking up not just so you'll be awake and be aware it's so you then stand up and start speaking against it in your own life if every believer just started speaking in their own neighborhood i'm not the darkness in the evil flooding my neighborhood i'm not agreeing with any evil takeover i'm not gonna i'm not tolerating it in any way in jesus name you have left you have like loosed bombs in the spirit realm against the darkness yeah and every evil person on the earth no matter who they are i mean there's a list of names i can't give you but if you if you spoke against the evil controlling them their power they've been operating and will be stripped away man left on their own has fear that's what they live in if they're in darkness and the power that's been given to them through satan or to operate in or demons around them to do that is stripped away this is what comes fear and confusion that's why you're going to see more and more of those people fall upon each other tell on each other that's a good sign that that foundation that god talked about is crumbling you cannot have a foundation of evil it never stands it won't even stand in the day of tribulation because no matter how bad satan wants everybody he's never going to get them and he isn't going to win now that's the main thing you have to remember god is not there just twiddling his thumbs he already had plans for all of this i'm not tolerating evil around me i'm not participating with it in any way whatsoever by gossiping about the bad things going on i i shoot darts into the heart of the enemy that would be satan and all his demons when i say i'm not tolerating the darkness i have power over i'm speaking against all these things have been said that we have to do in the spirit realm i want them to become like dust now can there's people something there's people we know who are evil you said you talked about there's a list and most of us could name nine or ten off the top of our head who we know they're doing evil they're everybody knows it they know their name they know what they're they've been up they know how famous they are for their evil now so if i know let's just say i take five or six of those who i know who i believe are the most evil tell me how i should decree without getting in trouble with god because we're not supposed to wish anyone to go to hell because god doesn't wish anyone to hell so how would we fight against what those specific people are doing without praying a miss or without decreeing wrongly it's what is what they're operating in my scarf's it's they operate because they have given themselves to the evil okay and a lot of them know they've done that and don't care they're benefiting from it some actually have had promises from evil beings that they will be promoted in satan's kingdom which is a joke they'll be promoted they'll be honored they'll have more than anyone else this is what they get they get tormented more than anyone else in hell and satan laughs at them i'm talking about the highest people involved in all this he will laugh at them and he will have them and he will take them to hell when they die that's what will happen to them that is their end and they can't change that end only by confessing to jesus christ and asking him to forgive will they not go there because you cannot commit that much evil against human flesh against babies against god's own against god's own and not think you're going to pay a profit so how do i pray for those people am i supposed to pray for mercy that they'll repent am i supposed to pray that god will you can always pray that but you still i'm not we're not talking we're talking about evil spiritual beings right now all right how do you how do you begin to affect the physical people being used whether by puppets or by permission how do we affect them and their activities you take authority over the demonic influencing them empowering them giving them information their selves as they can be more evil you're taking authority over them okay that's what you're doing okay we can't go into somebody and say to that person say that it probably isn't going to happen are you saying that anyway unless god said this is what's going to happen you would just say i as a believer of jesus christ you can just repeat it jack yeah yeah i'm as a believer in jesus christ see like yeah i'll say it after you yeah you got to repeat it i is a believer in jesus christ as a believer in jesus christ have power over all the power of the enemy have power over all the power of the enemy satan's kingdom satan's kingdom to speak against them to speak against them so i declare so i declare all those operating all those operating in the demonic realm in the demonic realm against these physical people i'm not the same name names against these these people right that i name them i command them to cease i command them to cease i can't command confusion i command confusion to come into the mind of the demons come into the minds of the demons for using these people who are using these people i command i command the host of heaven the host of heaven to pull down the strongholds to pull down the stronghold and shred the platform and shred the platforms of wickedness of wickedness in the spirit realm in the spirit realm to become nothing to become nothing in jesus name in jesus name right now right now amen amen good wow wow ken i want to ask you a question i can't remember if this was you uh part of me thinks i might have heard it through you or i heard it from some other prophetic person who said that they saw a couple regions that they even named that had god had one day turned them into like a region of light one of those that i heard mentioned again i don't remember who it was said that they saw las vegas as dedicated to the lord is that you that was yes it was wow i was actually in las vegas i've been there like what three or four times uh i was invited to speak in las vegas i was speaking in reno on a yearly basis and first of january i was invited to speak out all the time and i would see a lot of of course when in las vegas so let's talk about las vegas when i was in las vegas the first time i went i saw uh demon serpents wrapped around some of these great big old hotels that had gambling and let me tell you the thing why another thing that man is pornography and prostitution is legal yeah it's legal and they follow you around and give you up these packets these groups that's what they do for a living they go around to give it to different people and it tells you how to connect with very defiled defiled places that are already there so i saw unclean spirits i saw spirits of witchcraft i just tell you witchcraft i saw a wickedness in high places and these platforms you hear me talk about it's what it is it's a platform in the spirit realm and these demons sit on them and give orders to the other demons who to mark who to go after because of things that they're doing in that you know they call that the city of sin right [Music] in the midst of walking down the sidewalks and i would every now and then say something against something i saw the holy spirit would say something against us so i'd take authority over it and cast it out of that and it would it would have to leave it would scream and leave it would scream like it was on fire or i would just say fire fire of god and they would all run and scatter they were with these groups of people walking around so these are people had demons with them that were were working in defilement to defile people uh and they paid for the department but these other big buildings i saw some weren't hotels some are places that wicked people go to operate from they have operations there that are secret operations that are wicked and evil and i saw them and these like snakes were coming in and out of these buildings like poking his stuff in there and delivering stuff and coming back and he said those buildings that you're going right now i will take my hand one day and i'll go shh when he did that every one of them were gone every man on every building gone wow he said and i will put my mark on those buildings i would begin to see the mark of god either his own personal star which we call the star of david was actually put on these buildings there there was a cross on some of these buildings stopped saying the cross is irrelevant you're throwing away your whole salvation you need to know that they have crosses in heaven number one jesus christ is a carpenter that's his mark i bet it's important to him he died on one okay anyway i began to see the light of god come first because i talked about it from the ground up and began to consume these buildings and then all the lower level demons who'd been on assignment were running screaming like dust out of this city and god said one day this will be called the city of his son it will no longer be the city of sin i have a market for myself so las vegas is gonna be god if you think you can't affect your city i don't think they're as bad as that place okay the stuff that goes on that's actually been legalized by people who allow it to be legalized when when humans give permission that's why some areas are darker than others they're there in authority giving permission for that to happen and i don't need to say anything about what's going on in other places right now they're giving permission but you have a voice yourself as a believer you have more power in one little finger than all these wicked people do because you believe in the one who owns it all who made it all okay you need to find out from jesus christ what he wants for you what is your point where's your partner and all this i know this is to always speak life and light to people of course you always declare that people will not leave this earth until they've known jesus christ as their savior you allowed you're allowed to offer that but there are some there are some right now that will not have mercy and god has told me i will not give them mercy they've gone beyond what they know that is so defiled and so filled with the darkness and the evil if i don't wipe it out it will continue okay wow yeah yeah and you know i've asked you that question too about that mercy part and i if i believe that you that i'm being correct when i say usually the lord has shown him when someone has become that well known for their iniquitous ways they're by and large gone they've by and large given themselves over is that kind of what you're saying some of them have some of them don't care when they begin to not care about life itself yeah not any form of life they don't care what they do that is so wicked and evil they don't care who dies they don't care if they kill everybody and because if you give yourself to satan satan wants everyone to die i mean he wants everybody off this earth he wants to take over with his own regions of demons that's what he wants but he can't do that he doesn't have the authority or the power to do it he has to use mankind well apparently there's enough wicked people now who've been placed in different places that that can say things to make things happen for the devil but you know what there he's not god he is not god okay satan is not god people he was created as lucifer by god sin and evil was found in him by the way god did not create sin i need to clear that up he one of his accusations bought against him by god was uh iniquity was found in him that sin wicked evil sin it was found in he himself desired and that's why that's the only thing he can say is his nothing else that was made was made by him god made everything in this earth how we use it or what we do with it that's our decision it's our decision but there would be a day when evil that person called evil satan will not be on the earth they'll still be angry people angry leaders in countries who haven't received god when that tribulation does end there's going to be people on the earth that haven't accepted christ they're just going to be the people who will survive it although people always show in movies they've nobody survived well who is christ going to rule over on his throne yeah and it does talk about those people and some of them will be kings and he said they won't want to bring what they have before him he'll say i won't send rain on your land because they'll be wicked evil people so yes he jesus christ is still going to have a say in this earth especially sitting on the throne in the millennial reign it will happen it's after the kingdom age comes that millennial age but right now it is a decision ground and i hear more people who don't know what time it is they say you have to make a decision now for christ well everybody should every day is a good day to receive christ and start operating with him instead of giving yourself to the other side which is you're never going to win on that side but there will be regions of light where people will sickness will not be able to abide not even crime can take place in those regions wow wouldn't that be no crime no sickness uh it's gonna be a little bit like heaven on earth i was gonna say that it sounds a little bit like heaven it's like a pre it's like one of the the single most beautiful place and situation you would have ever have lived in up to that point any human being right this side of heaven yes that is absolutely true and the miraculous will be happening everywhere i i like to say this about the miraculous it will you'll never become familiar every time you see a miracle of god a suddenly of god god given you you know his goodness or moving his hand on your behalf you never become familiar you're overwhelmed every time by his love by his patience with us he is long-suffering and i think i mentioned this the last time the reason why noah had to take 120 years to build the ark wasn't because god was trying to make noah work he offered out of the long suffering of god's own lobby allah 120 years for anyone to repent that was there they would have been on the ark so all those wicked people had 120 years to tell god they were repent for their evil ways they wanted to know him they could have been on that ark so it was their own fault their own a hardheartedness that they didn't god didn't need 120 years from noah to build the ark he wanted to give 120 years for all the evil wicked so yes he is long suffering he does want to extend his mercy but we we have a choice to make with our own will and right now god wants you to stand up with your own and start declaring against any evil present that you're not tolerating it i serve only the most high god i don't serve the darkness i will not tolerate the darkness you just say that in your own home you're releasing stuff in the atmosphere that god can actually use against that physical darkness that's trying to take over this world so i'm not ignoring anything and i am not ignorant and very well informed by the god who made this world but i also know he has a timeline and this is not the end it may be the end of many wicked people but i do ask for mercy you have to add that mercy for those who were sucked into it forced into it threatened into it and they don't want it god make a way for them to get out of that in jesus name yeah for those i suppose that god would seem to have even more mercy if they were literally from birth victimized sacrificed over and all that they didn't even have a choice i can imagine the lord giving them extra you know attention to make sure they had the choice that was never given to them so wow wow well cat you know i think you know we could go on and on i have a list of questions but i don't want to tamp down anything you've already said i don't i feel glad to just ask you if you would just pray for the people who are just what i'm hearing is a lot of people saying this is so encouraging why doesn't anybody speak or why don't more people speak about the encouragement that's ahead of us so maybe just pray for those people and whatever god fills your heart with yeah father i thank you for this beautiful day that you have made no man has made this day no man holds the air we breathe no man really says what can happen what cannot happen only you alone sitting on your throne you have the right to say that you in the word made this world you made everything ever existed your son came and died because you asked him to if you think people that there is not mercy why did he come to die he didn't have to he he agreed to do that but he wasted hell on the third day he took authority walking as a righteous man he was the son of god he's also called the son of man he walked righteously on the earth hell could not hold him so it should not be able to hold you force you put fear in you you need to stand up and start saying i'm not tolerating the darkness i'm not tolerating the evil around me anymore open your front door and kick it out and then you say i invite god the god that created all things his son jesus christ i invite holy spirit to consume this property consume our home and then you begin to build a habitation for heaven which is what we all need around us god i speak against anyone trying to control hurt a maim or steal people's identities their destinies in jesus name i command a billion of those to go forth begin to pull down every stronghold over every single believer in this country and then around this world that is waiting for you to move your hand god open their eyes put the faith of god the power of god in each one of them god they have a right to speak they have a right to have authority through jesus christ i thank you father now i declare and release your life your presence your power your will your way your celebration your expectation for me to run with it for your children to run with it god know who they are they are over the darkness satan is our doormat and any evil thing that follows him or gives permission they better repent if they want to go to heaven or the day is coming justice has been released you're about to move it out and we're going to see your hand move on behalf of this country and this world in ways never seen before in jesus holy precious beloved name a amen wow amen amen amazing this is really really really good today very very hope-filled so hey tell people how

WEDNESDAYS WITH KAT AND STEVE - Episode 58

or https://youtu.be/zf3gPBQDcZk
hey cat hi yeah that was all for free you got to watch all that for free yes it was nice getting to see your staff though people think you know they see you and they think that's it and it's not true really you've got to have a lot of other people to do things that's why it costs money and even people say well why do you have to sell products why do you have to do that and i said well because we put money out we have to pay money out for all kinds of things where you know the building the electricity whatever just in normal things but then when you have staff involved or if you order a lot of equipment and supplies and stuff to produce things you're putting out it does cost a lot of money and god is faithful though but the staff is so important it really is next to your own family i have to say the staff that work with you day to day is so important now i'm going to be in agreement with what you're doing or you're going to have issues to believe in that god has called you and placed you or he has and to show honor and everybody needs to show honor to one another that's something in this new year that we're doing we're going to make some changes that's going to really help everybody have more fun do things together as our staff and we'll be some at some point moving into a building itself this year which will make everything much easier for all of us awesome awesome well kat we talked a little bit off the air we're going to take a twist not a bad twist a good twist but talk about some things i'm trying to decide do i just throw it open for anything first or should i get to my questions that we were talking about off the air what would you like to do um go ahead with the things that are off the air okay let's do that let's talk about that first okay so here's what's here's what the let me just introduce it like this uh we get lots and lots of emails and we can't answer every single one but the probably one of the most common questions that comes out just in general not just with cats show but all the shows is they'll say steve kat said and robin said da da da da da and they and they and they'll list what it is they said and they'll say who's right and basically who's wrong and so i was talking to you about the and i i it's very important for me to tell the people you and your husband are good friends with robin and his wife robin and rob yes we are so we are when you see things really really differently at times uh this is not a friendship breaker this is not a deal break in your relationship isn't it no it's not okay so so what happens i'll just continue with the question then so robin had a very intense word about the president's life and praying for this his safety and all that and i brought that up to you you don't watch because you keep your prophetic uh disconnected so that you get your right from god if i'm saying that right right and i said that to you today about the president's safety and what what was your initial response about that well i had of course um the father will talk to me anything that has to now we know who president we're talking about um yeah anything comes up about him the father will immediately tell me and then i will do what is what i normally would do uh there is a million hosts with him right now in florida let's just say in florida in florida right now a strategic positions strategic places um and their assignment is to be with him as long as god is using him for specific things they will remain so i had done that that was it that was the limit that's all he told me to do he didn't tell me to um and let me say this first i have to say this verse when god chooses people to be a prophet there that's the office of a prophet that's not somebody who's real prophetic or they see prophetic things or hear them sometimes that is their office that is a position that gives them a lot of authority with god he's going to clearly speak to them but he does not tell every prophet the same thing and you should never expect for those who are new to it you can't expect every prophet to say the same exact words about the same exact thing because we're not going to do that i have my whole call in my life as a prophet to train the body of christ to be powerful to know their spiritual weapons and do that type of thing but also to know about heaven my number one call is to reveal heaven to earth i've been there thousands of times so i'm going to speak mainly about that if god has something to say about things going on in the earth he'll tell me i will certainly tell people and right now we have a lot going on in the earth and he shows me different parts of that and what to do about the different things he's going to show robin something different that doesn't make either one of us wrong it doesn't it's just that he's handling that for god and dealing with that i'm dealing with the another part of it hank's dealing with another part of that daniel i mean we all have our part with god but one thing we do do is we know we each hear god and we'll honor them as the office of a prophet and so i would encourage people what you're being told in the moment um you should participate in that like praying for the president of course is always going to be important and i would just say this they've always been trying to take him out people yeah they could get rid of anyone on the earth it would be him because he is a big threat but god's got him in his hand but robin because it was revealed that's what he shares what is revealed to me i will share and you're never going to be disappointed in hearing the voice of god and making sure that it is all covered but by different ones of us so don't expect us all to say exactly the word and i can't validate robin i didn't hear that from god i can't validate hank he can't validate me or johnny in law or any of the other prophets we have we're accountable for what he shows us and tells us to say and to and to share and so that's what we're doing yeah he wouldn't have us here yeah and i'll say this let me add this because there's there's that one that just came up and the one that we get even more than that and you know i i am a perfect piece i'll just tell you i didn't used to be this way but i after knowing cat and knowing robin i'm at perfect peace that robin holds a position that at any moment of the day the rapture could happen i think he but he also holds he also holds and he said on the air that what cat's position in his position could all be true at the same time i don't quite get what he means but i get robin robin knows what he means and i get cat i tend to be like for everything i see you know this says this gospel of the kingdom will be preached to all the world and then the end will come where there's about five billion of the seven who have not yet had the gospel preached them so it's easy it's easy for me to say we got some time we got some work to do but there's an imminent uh in the heart and understanding of robin and so and how about how do you what else would you like to say about that cat i would say that um it depends on the way god uses a prophet also i have to say that um some prophets are more stubborn not saying robin is stubborn in any way but even in the old testament and in the new testament there were prophets that weren't very happy about what god gave them to say but they said it anyway and uh i can just say that you know we we all know that um jonah didn't want to say some things right and uh but god had him in the end say what he needed him to say and i think obedience is very key uh for the prophet to realize uh whatever he is saying i will say it they all also they are still individuals we are individuals like i i'm just going to say this i like different colors i like different food i like different things i i'm not in a box in that in that that we all have to eat the same thing or like the same thing so inside our heart what we've been raised in what we understand and and as pointed out in the word is what we will follow but i was taken on purpose and shown before earth began after even after the new earth is here god has on purpose taking me down his own timeline and so for me i will focus and say what god has shown me on his timeline not any calendar not anybody's calendar anybody else's timeline no matter how many are out there i have to say what god has shown me on his own and on his own we are not anywhere near i know sometimes people are impacted by the things are going on right now he's actually setting up for what's about to happen the next 100 years would be so key to seeing the power and the glory in this earth and god is not willing to give that up he's going to make sure it happens he's going to love all those who stand and speak for him he'll honor them he'll reward them and so you you trust that god knows what he's doing and this only thing that will happen uh uh you know in the end is what god wants to happen his timeline will happen his way and on his day and it says no man knows the day that the lord will return and even that's not the end people please you need to really understand when christ returns is not the end okay that's the beginning of another whole age you know the millennial age will happen that's christ himself sitting on the throne in jerusalem it's going to happen that's a thousand more years so you can't really talk about the earth being destroyed and disappearing and dissipating and i'm not saying robin's saying that or hank or anyone else i'm just saying it can't happen because things have not happened that god in his own words said would happen yet rest assured you're in the sum of the greatest times that are about to happen not the opposite and all those who were were pure to their word and their understanding when they get to heaven they'll still be happy anyway it's not over until the father says it's over and we're in the great days that seem impossible to you but not with god we had some guests that have come to us and especially when we were in the studio not so much now but we had some guests and they would describe several different programs that they were on one of them they had to spell out pages and pages and pages of their theology to tell the this tv station so they would now if they would be allowed you know when is the rapture you know and i don't i've never seen the form but i understand it's very voluminous um and and i think let me just tell you folks that's not us we want to know that a prophet is is prophesying they're a person of good character they have the office of a prophet uh or close to it and maybe i'll put it that way their character is good their reputation's good we're not gonna ask them what's their va what's their uh position on when the rapture is we're not gonna ask him those kind of questions it's one of the main reasons is that particular issue has just split the body of christ we don't want to do that so whatever your position is say it with firm but we won't we will not tend to even major on that issue and i'm talking kind of out of both sides of my mouth because it is true and count you've seen this it is true that i and we do tend to gravitate towards this position which is we're going to be here for a while we've got work to do it is true but we are the last thing last scripture in the adjustment occupy until i come he never said sit there and try to figure out every day and everything and every month so everything lines up with what you you assume will happen you know it says to occupy that means take authority that doesn't mean sit around and wait doesn't mean sit on the sofa it means you take authority you will be active in the kingdom and preach the gospel the king be active and demonstrating and manifesting who god is that's what we're all supposed to be doing right now not trying to figure out if we have to drag our rapture rug out or escape to the mountains he didn't say to do any of that you're supposed to be busy doing things for him until the father says to his son going down you know i think of that scripture where jesus tells the story about there was a master and he went to a far away place where he's talking about the son going to be back with his father and and though the servants you know were given a task to do and then after a while they kept not coming back kept not coming back and they said he's not coming back so they began to beat their fellow servants and put them in bondage and and then then basically when the master did come there was there was trouble to pay you know a lot of trouble you know and and the bottom line was if the masters delay they're supposed to be doing he gave them a job to do they were just supposed to be doing it you know that was what that whole parable is and and what was important was how they treated their fellow servants a long way that was what what he was looking at and and so anyway well we could talk about that for a lot but that's the fascinating thing but just remember folks the guests we have on we don't pre-screen them that they have to agree with everything theologically especially as it relates to that now i'm going to say one other thing and i'm going to admit this is a personal bias we knew and felt absolutely convicted through our prophets there are earlier ones that god was saying he who he had picked the man in florida who starts with the t that was the man and god had not changed his mind so yes in that vein that wasn't a theological position that was like what if you're hearing what we're hearing those are the prophets that we brought on i will say that so you know we're not going to bring someone on um there was someone that used to write for us and he took a position and his position was and this is what he said he said god said deal with it biden's president now it doesn't matter if he stole he's president now pray for him well now he's not riding for us i'm not mad at him i'm not he's not an enemy but he's not riding force he's not a guest so that kind of position we'll take but we don't we won't ruin a friendship over it it wasn't a punishment we just didn't schedule them for the show or we don't schedule his work so i think that makes sense so well kat anything else you want to share before we get into questions the thing i just want to um i have to say what god has said to me almost every single day to keep a heart of celebration because that is his plan and no matter what you see going on i'm not saying it isn't happening i'm well aware that's why i take authority over it all the time uh make sure you're not participating when you participate with what the darkness is or what the plans of the enemy is you're highlighting that you're supposed to talk more about the power and the love of god and god's plans in this time that inspires encourages and it just it just dissolves fear because you know yourself god's never given us a spirit of fear but a power love and a sound mind so what you should be doing right now in this moment no matter what's going on you should be walking in the power of god having a sound mind and no fear whatsoever that's what you should be doing good good good cat well i've got eight-year-old lana if i'm saying her name right with the first question she says did jesus always look young even as an adult so that's her question well i'm quite certain that he could not have been young and gone to the cross he couldn't have been young in the fact that um you know maybe he didn't look totally mature or at his age he was 33 and we all know that that doesn't mean you look sorry sweet and heaven please i probably hear that more than anything else jesus had a light that was in him all the time and and he was a real character he was he knew who he was at that point in his life he knew he was the son of god he knew that all of creation was made by him he walked with such uh confidence in this earth knowing he made this and he came to die for those who were on the earth that was his goal but i can tell you he laughed a lot and a lot of people don't see him that way they seem only serious or fierce you know when he up up ended the whole temple courtyard and everything because they were doing things wrong there that's why he did it but he was focused on what god sent him for what his father sent him for to let people know the truth to let them know that you're not supposed to be afraid even he taught about not being afraid of the darkness so he walked in confidence but it made him a little bit bold he was bold but he was liked very much even the sinners liked him because guess what he didn't speak doom and gloom to people even back then he took about the power of god the life of god the light in us you know why he came and and i think that that probably would set him apart he probably seemed maybe had that spirit of youth in him since he was actually eternal right and i think that's more than what she she's talking about he always had so much life in him there was nothing that even probably was even close to even aging but he did reach the physical age of 33 he was strong even in the natural he was strong he lifted trees he built he was a carpenter he used timbers he moved those himself so he was strong he was in great shape he was happy at the light of god in him uh people wanted to be with him all the time so i can see that he had that spirit of use or life in him so as far as that goes yes he always acted like he was he was never would probably act that he was an old person at all nor did he even think that way he loved to be with children also all the time which to many people back then probably would have been more of a a chore or something like that he never felt that way he liked the life the imagination uh the belief that they had and so in that spirit of youth i think that's probably always going to be in him good good all right now i've got um this is it says i i imc ega so i don't know if that's a name or a username it says username here and the question is is god's hair like pure wool as described in daniel 7 9 says cat cat said she touched it could she run her fingers through woolly hair i guess that's the way she wrote it now i i need to make a slight correction which i rarely do they said white as wool white as well did not say it was wool it is not woolly he was talking about you know that was something he could equate to back in that day you have to understand you think of the culture of the day the sheep the sheep who were like the pure sheep whether they their wall was white it was extremely white and they would stand out with their black faces if you never actually saw a sheep you should go look it up uh back in that day their their their wool was very white and it was highlighted by the black face that they had black wolves and so maybe you never thought about that but god's hair is no way is it woolly jesus is not wooly it said it was white as because on the earth they couldn't have anything else that they could at that day think of to compare it to his hair was not his hair was alive when i touched it life shot into my arm it shot up my spiritual and i'm always um somebody had painted a painting of a horse believe it or not with other colors mixed in it but when i looked at that picture it i saw the face of god in it and uh but i don't want to equate him to looking like a horse but like the mane on the horse was the most beautiful hair i'd ever seen on a horse but literally i don't think they realized that they painted what was imposed over that looked like the face of god i mean it looked like that his eyes are flames of fire real flames of fire but his hair uh the father's hair is like longer than jesus's hairs it's beautiful his fear is amazing but life is in every part of his being and when i barely touch the strands of his hair i even now right now having goosebumps taking him out life was in his hair it was like moving not moving a lot but it was moving because it was life in it it was the whitest white i'd ever seen light was coming from it and i'm sure that's why they tried to describe him he said it was white as wool it's about the whitest white i've ever seen and again because the father can do what he wants to he can either let all of the glory come from him where you see nothing people been they haven't seen nothing but maybe images of eyes or the shape of a head he has so much glory pouring from him but he really wanted to establish to me he has a body his arms his legs has a torso even though he's got the spiritual body it's real it's very real and he'll reach out and he'll hold you when you get to having them if he lays his hand on you sometimes he'll just walk behind me and lay his hand on me i get so undone i'm talking about on the earth sometimes he will come and just visit him briefly and then leave and he actually did that in the old testament so it's not a strange thing and you need to believe in your heart that he cares enough about you he's probably been with you and you didn't even know it if he didn't make himself visible you maybe felt the presence so powerful if you've ever been consumed by absolute waves of love that would be the father standing near you he is love his son carries that love but he is love and and but the light coming from the glory coming from his hair and his whole uh but he condemned that and sometimes when you come home to heaven to stay he will let you see his face he'll let you see the flames of fire that's his passion burning for you but his hair it wasn't woolly and it never said it was it said white so it's extremely white it's kind of long it is is wavy but like i said the waves of his hair and i just was so undone just to be even near him near him at the throne well you this gave me two more questions that had just occurred to me so i'm going to ask him um have has jesus ever come to you in the form of the line of the tribe of judah and if he's coming to you in the form of a lion have you can you see his jesus face in that lies it seemed like what you just described the father's face and the horse or whatever um almost never has he come in the in the no he's just come in person okay i mean like you're seeing me i yeah because you know he has his he's immortal he has his body he has his body back from the grave he's got that body you can literally put your hands in the actually the the the holes are here oh wow if they had been here it would have pulled off on the cross you know that nail could have that the holes are right here and if if you're with him in heaven somewhere and a breeze blows you can see those marks still still in the head where the crown of thorns were but he's so amazingly powerful he sat next to me in my own home and put his arm around me i thought it was gonna melt into the of all the things he said on my loveseat i'll never get rid of that loveseat okay never ever ever get on it and feel his presence today wow when it my home is in stores right now because we'll be moving whoever sat on it could feel his presence just come up around them so his anointing and his presence is so tangible a lot of people said i never could see him if he visited him as i felt him i felt him put his arms around me it's one of the most glorious things and in heaven you can see him whenever you want to but i've seen him in person he's not like i would say he's not a pretty boy he's a strong looking uh god he's strong and he does still have muscle um his physical body he was a carpenter okay his hands looked like they were the hands of a carpenter but if man i'm just telling you just want to be near him i could just say that that's amazing now a minute ago you said um and i never thought this until you just said it you said something like he might have even you're talking about he the lord your father might have even been with you but you didn't know it was him and i'm thinking wait a minute is it possible that the father visits every one of his kids in person i think probably at some time in their life he probably did interesting you have to remember he is the father the father he was your original father no matter who raised you on the earth he is the number one father to you because he carried you in him he carried you lived in him there's no if you could look inside god you would not see there's no distance in him there's no back to him on the inside this glorious river of life and stones of fire and little spirits of life playing in there that's where you were so he carried you before he sent you to this earth and planted you you know in in the womb of the the mother he he carried you and put you like a seed in there and uh and then you grew but he wants you to know him i can tell you that's why jesus's greatest thing himself was he what he talked we talked about the father all the time because he loves the father and that was one of his biggest topics was talking about the father and mentioned him he said he even said there's none good but god he was talking about his father he was good but to him he's the greatest that the father would be the greatest to him awesome all right this is kind of a fun question carla is asking this you know there's that thing i live in texas for a while you know they say texas there's a saying when you live in texas that texas is a is a whole other country you know they call it a whole other country so here's maybe that's what's in this carla's mind she says is there a place in heaven that is like texas i would love to get into her mind and say what is she looking for you know she absolutely is right there is a place like texas there's a place that's got um the same terrain back in this day in this day like i'm in the future talking um on the earth you would say oh there's herds of wild horses running around in texas it's beautiful the river you know the the i don't want to name rivers because i'm not so good with topography or geography down here on the earth and having them really good with it but but you would see certain things in texas in the state of texas there's a strength in texas uh there's a frequency in texas itself that god made of freedom he actually planted freedom in texas and uh not that he didn't put it somewhere else but some there's some states or some regions or even some countries he actually put more of something in the foundation of that whole area and texas wears freedom it does they had to fight for their own freedom back in the day and by the way they wouldn't mind doing it right now but in this part i know because we're just going to go crazy right now we're going to probably get people's people going to love all this and they won't i've seen people went home to to texas it's a whole lot of the west who live in this western that looks like the west and not wild though maybe the holy spirit would show up he'd be wild but but there are areas in in heaven that look like the west they just are and someone in particular i have seen absolutely in heaven would be john wayne i don't mind dropping names people i've seen him there what is he doing making cowboy movies what did he do on the earth all right you use your gift in heaven and i saw him making a cowboy movie uh in this place that looks just like the west except there's no bandits okay you're not gonna roast get scorched be bit by scorpions none of that happens so in your natural mind you always go to well this is there and it's not there it's a glorious beautiful place but it looks just like the west and i happen to know he lives in this part john wayne lives in that part of heaven he loves that part of heaven it's got rivers running through it off of the crystal sea but it to me when i saw it looked like the west and so yes there is areas that look like the west there's places that look like it snows all the time that has fall all the time and like i love what the hell the father explained to me why we have seasons here we have a season you know that comes and goes right like the winter spring comes and goes but in heaven they are like that all the time and the father said when i made the seasons on the earth i took a shadow of four of my favorite places in heaven more than four don't say i said there's four places i took a shadow of four of my favorite places in heaven and put on the earth as seasons wow that's amazing that is amazing now i got to ask you this because there's something you just said you said you're not so good with the topography down here as you are in heaven which begs the question you've been there so many times if you were to sit with a piece of paper could you draw out this is where this is and this is over as as if it was a kind of map would you know where you have your orientation of where you are you know steve you've heard me say many times heaven is the world that's why the earth is round hello flat earth people forget it heaven is the world it's around it's a round or if the earth was made of the shadow of heaven then the earth would have to be round because heaven is so the father's house that jesus talked about in my father's house so many mansions and people have for ages try to picture how many mansions can you get in a building because your mind is earthbound right the the house that the father calls it it's a whole world it's a whole world and i pretty much could draw kind of what's at one of the tops and what's i can tell you what's on the bottom of the world called heaven that's michael's headquarters oh really really yeah because they're saying they're sending them to the earth it makes sense right it's what it's way up beyond anything you can see you're not going to find heaven with no no telescope and no no a satellite or anything you will ever see heaven because it's a spiritual world a literal place where you live literally in your spiritual body uh it's an unseen it says that what was made that is seen was made by that what was unseen so there's a lot of activity up there in the spirit realm uh that you in your mind couldn't even possibly imagine but but god from where he sits can see everything it actually says the earth is his footstool so you know he had to shrink himself to come and walk on me yeah well right but he had to shrink himself and where are his foot touched the mountains they set on fire there was a fire so if you think he's unaware of what's going on you don't know him yeah so yeah so this earth is a shadow and a type of what is in heaven but also even the way he made it so there's mountains there's rivers there's an ocean in heaven called the crystal sea um there's there's the there's places that look like the west it looked like the north it looked like uh the south there's places that look like spring okay there's many places what i could do and actually have sketched myself in a lot of my journals and one day we will actually make a movie we are going to make a movie it would take you to these little places in heaven that i was shown i don't think i connect i could connect the whole world together but there are places and i know what's near them those i could do something like that awesome awesome yeah it never occurred to me that you i know you might if you were going to walk it or fly it on your own go down here turn left here i mean you would know certain places you would know where they are maybe i never i always have people with me so i don't get lost in the airport okay yeah i do remember that i remember seeing your husband take you by the arm through the airport you walked right past this we were okay uh this person lin for christ is their username they want to know what what is the book of records i don't know if that's i don't know if there's a if you've just talked about that i'm not sure if that's the bible term of book of records she wants to know what's the book of records there are so many books i couldn't name them all you think he doesn't have one here's my birthday's right the father is a writer okay the lord was the orator he the the lord likes to speak he doesn't care to write things i just know that about jesus even when he was learning the torah he loved to read read read he didn't like so much to write things that's just the way he was but the father is definitely a writer he loves to write record in old school it was old school to be timeless school i guess you'd have to say it's timeless he loves to write in books there's the lamb's book of life that's a whole different one he has a book of remembrance that's a whole different book but there are things that are recorded there's actually a hall of records there's a whole hall where things have been recorded over time accurately recorded by him so there's a whole hall of records there's one that pertains to you yourself and things in your life there's there's your own book he wrote i wrote i wrote you know your your book for you every day of your life he wrote it in a book that's a whole separate book that's just for you so there are books of records there's a hall of records um there's so many different places to go and see and be be a part of in heaven you'd have to be here for eternity to even begin to be part of it um but there's beautiful places that record things there's different ways no things are like we would say video audio they don't call that in heaven they just things are captured they capture things and say that you don't say they read they don't record they capture them which when they capture something or they have retained something it's what it felt like what it smelled like what was said what was done really uh it was very accurate but for he for himself he does have a book of remembrance that's his favorite book to write in so he he doesn't have to but he does it because he wants to do it and he remembers every kind thing let's just go there every kind wonderful thing you've done for him every person you've helped every person you fed every time you uh picked up a wounded animal i mean animal health whatever it was it was kindness he records and remembers that and then when you pray when you pray and say father uh i really would like to have this or i need this now he goes back to your book and remember says look at all the kind things they did for me look how they treated this person even when they weren't nice so i can tell you that's good there are books of records halls of records in heaven so and but much of it is very beautiful wonderful things it's not always like they're writing every bad deed done when you get born again that's kind of like wiped out if you if you repent for your sins it's like you never did them you need to remember that and you've been sinning lately please go again again please repent again god didn't never give us the ability to freely sin once you get saved people actually believe that and some even teach that he never said that it said since grace of balance should sin also bound in god's head god forbid so because there's grace for eternal life and grace for forgiving you that doesn't mean you should just live a sinful life you're not you're not doing anything good for god even for yourself or your destiny so we're just kind of went there because of the record thing but when you do repent no matter what you've done you sincerely repent god wipes it away and doesn't remember it because remember the books of remembrance are the good things right the book of records might be other things and when you pretend that part is wiped out that's like that you never know and you said that they don't use the word video and audio but they capture it and it's like a 3d movie video thing yeah in our language but if a person goes to heaven and wants to look at their life and they're not going to see sin that was forgiven or they wouldn't even be there but would they be able to see things like that time they went through an intersection and an angel came and did this to this car and would that kind of thing be recorded it would be recorded but also would be all the funny silly things you did like like like what like when you were in your pre-teens in your early days the wow like you know i'm gonna jump this canal like he will see how that worked out and of course it would be miserably fail but you wouldn't get hurt but funny silly things you did you will see that you actually go to these they actually have a place where your friends and your own family when you get to heaven you're not going to escape seeing that movie because they're going to take you to see it and uh it'll be delightful this is like the silly things you did that he rescued you with like sometimes you didn't get rescued you know maybe some of the fashion of the day when you dress like i don't know emcee hammer or something would they show things like um i love anthony by the way he's a very cool person yeah yeah um would they show things like um how the lord when they show how he talked to this person to come share the gospel like that where they would show how he got a hold of how your life was apprehended through the through other people would they show that kind of thing i think you definitely i think you probably absolutely see that i know that you will see this is what you do see you see your life relive with the operations of the spirit realm from heaven's perspective oh every time your life was rescued every time uh a god intervened that you didn't know about you'll see all of that okay very cool very very good born again of course when you get born again but once when you see yourself get bored again you will flash up to heaven in the video or this movie and you'll see how all of heaven celebrated including father's day when you got born again how they celebrated yeah yes yeah that's always been a hard one maybe you've seen what you're talking about but on the earth there could be a in a given day even though we've heard of so many people get saved in china and underground church but there could be hundreds of thousands of people getting saved today coming to the lord and yet when i see that scripture it says there's more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents and and so how does it seems like heaven would be constantly in a state of celebration maybe it is how do they all have a rejoice is it that is that what they're doing is constantly celebrating well they do celebrate all the time people and especially their families or friends or something like they're really going to celebrate uh that their family member got born again oh they can't stop talking about they go all over heaven and talk about even for the people really really celebration is such in their heart knowing that forever they'll be together for eternity so it is a big thing it's a big thing to know that your family members got born again so to use it in a practical way uh let's say i and my wife uh went to heaven one you know events different times now we're friends and uh maybe our grandchild was not was walking away from the lord okay a grandchild now they're all just babies almost but if at the time when that grandchild comes to the lord i'm running up to drain or she's running up to me and said did you hear so and so got saved right is it kind of like that huh well actually what what actually happens is the father lets you know right before it happens and you watch it you go to this design where you can look down on the earth and you declare over your family members and stuff and there's like these columns around heaven and when someone's face comes up on these different columns or like big monitors they know on those columns when it comes up they're about to get born again so they will run into one of these portals that are huge places you walk you run up these steps and look over the balcony you actually can watch your family members getting born again then the whole place breaks it the whole place celebrates every time so if you're there with a thousand people watching the family members you can imagine the celebration going on if they're all there to watch their family members get born again yeah well it's like they're all looking down but they're sitting down wow okay uh this person wants to know can you command demons out of somebody without the permission of the person you're praying for and i guess i mean that's deliverance so i don't know if there's a special what they have in their mind whether it's a ministry setting you can certainly cast a demon out of somebody right without their permission i'm not sure it actually says in the bible that's what christ gives us the power to cast out demons you know he says that right he says that so anywhere where you are if you're in authority if you have the understanding of what's going on usually the holy spirit will move on you to he'll just say cast out that demon and you will do in jesus name i i've done it many times in different places and it didn't even have to be like a church setting it didn't and that wasn't anything that was planned um you know outside of a theater or something and if if it manifests that means if you see it the manifestation of one you you have every right and authority to cast that demon out lots of times people aren't even in control of their own mind anymore you absolutely have the right to cast that demon out there are some people who have them and want them and i know that sounds awful but they do and they know what they are and then they want it you expound what do you mean cat they want them when they know that they're demons what do you mean they want them can you be more specific well i i i don't know about the darkness today but i will just say they they talk about people who who were there's a difference by the way there's a huge difference in being influenced by demons and being possessed by demons okay oh what we're talking about the casting out is someone who has one living in them and you that may freak you out but jesus lives in you okay jesus when you got born again he stepped on the inside of you he lives there people watch what you're saying i always like to say give jesus a good day give your angels a good day your angels were sent to be with you they're also present they're also there uh no matter where where you are your angels are seen i mean they're seen by each other of course as a seer you see all this going on around you is i have to focus sometimes when i go in a place because i'm seeing all this i'm seeing people's angels i'm seeing demons that are trying to speak to people they'll try to whisper things in your ear that aren't gone that's being influenced by one okay a possession is a as a whole totally different thing they probably can't even think on their own or do normally even natural everyday things needed for them to live in a situation like that you better know the power of god you better not have sin in you and try to cast a demon you just need to know that's not going to remember the seven sons of skiva go back to the bible uh they thought because they saw you know all of them cast demons out they thought they could do the same thing and the demon came out and jumped on them i'm not trying to scare you i'm just saying what's biblical you can't live a life of sin even as a christian which sounds crazy and think you're going to cast demons out they're going to come after you so if you're operating if you're operating and righteously and you have authority and you know you have authority and a situation like that that would be the most natural thing for me to say i cast you out in jesus name get out he had me do that in a whole congregation and this whole massive congregation of like 700 people three demons literally ran out of the people and those people were set free instantly from the the the the the demon that had controlled them either they gave themselves to it and i'm saying you cannot just go play around in the darkness people you should not have an ouija board i am sorry that's how you contact me you don't want one of those you don't want to mess with witchcraft i just have to be honest if you want to be full of god in these days and walk in great authority you don't have to be a prophet to do that you do need to know who you are in christ and who christ is and you walk to please him you you have authority over the darkness the bible says so you do and there's a whole list of things that you have the right to do as a believer it doesn't have to be necessarily a five-fold person in the ministry you as a righteous person have great authority in the earth but you can't play in the enemy's camp in other words you can't decide well i'm a born-again believer you know i'm operating i'm reading my word i'm i'm declaring things and and then decide to go to some wicked evil science party a guest and that guest you wouldn't want with you i'm not talking about a physical one so you need to you need to be accountable for your life and actions when you get to the age of accountability that means you know the difference and you know what's right or wrong don't play with the darkness okay if you want to be safe and powerful don't play with darkness um you just don't want to do that and i don't even know how we got into all that yeah but as far as casting demons out we we have authority to do that jesus those who followed him believed in him who had repented of the sins was living righteously they had the right to do that and remember the one man he cast all the demons out and prayed over him and then he sent him to do the same thing because he'd received christ but you need to know who you are who christ is who is christ he made everything that ever existed that does exist and will ever exist that's who he is when you give yourself to him you get everything with him you're not giving up your few little sins you had or you feel little things you like to do and play in you're getting a life eternal to one day being immortal and this is what you're giving yourself to it's not just oh no i have to read a bible it's not that it's who are you giving yourself to because one way or the other you're going to participate in the darkness or you're going to be in the light with jesus christ so i would say run after him get along and say i want to know you jesus i want to know you more i want to know about you i'm going to be like you you're going to start having his presence show up because of what you're saying okay what you say matters in this world and so don't be bashing trashing swearing profanity is how's language people i'm sorry i don't tolerate don't ever swear about me don't swear around me i'll cast that on you that's good all right now i think i may know where this came from but let's see okay so you said you said in the past everything in heaven is alive the flowers don't die the grass is alive things like that and this person may have heard that but maybe i don't know if you said the angels took care of the flowers but this person says what do angels have to do when they take care of the flowers do they have to water weed fertilize so i don't know what you might have said did you say the angels take care of them okay so what did they do they care for them uh they'll go and sing they'll release the life of god they'll go visit them i mean there's there are some that their assignment and there's some that care for the waterfalls there's ones that care for the meadows and the flowers and the creatures god doesn't have to feed them it's not the physical food you're thinking on you're connected to earth okay i'm talking about heaven the life of god feeds everything in heaven you eat in heaven because you love to eat you don't eat because you have to do it to live so these these things he made that he imparts the life life of god or joy they may bring waves of joy to whole meadows and the flowers begin to sing with joy so there's things that they're assigned to do in heaven but it's never going to be the fertilizer fertilizer they're not going to dig and put plants in there okay uh if you're a gardener in heaven you'll speak and plants will begin to come up on the ground oh wow you're gardening with your with your mouth by speaking new things that's right very cool very cool very cool um here's one i don't know if this is a child or not but i know that's a serious question but this is does anyone go to heaven and not like it and now do they what no does anyone go to heaven there is not one single person who's ever moved to heaven and lived there and not liked it okay there's so many things i don't even have time to tell about or share about that exist there you're living in an atmosphere of joy there's nothing in you that would despise or not like it's not even in you i know in your head you can't understand that because i know you go to a store and you go i don't like that outfit but i like that one no i would never wear that but i sure would like to own that it isn't like that in heaven okay you love everything you have your favorites or you'll go to different places to get favorite things that you like because everything's just given to you things are created to me but it's given to you but you're not ever going to say i don't like living here that is impossible you are so filled every bar part of your being is filled with the life and love of god and if anything you love more you love your family more you love god more you love his house the world called heaven you love everything about it you get to go on tours and nothing costs anything there's no money in heaven uh everything is freely given people share the gift that they are that they were on the earth that only they use it in more fantastic ways than they would like an artist doesn't just have to paint on a canvas their paint floats in the air whatever they use to make things it's just there they paint with light they paint the sky of heaven and it's there for a while then it fades and they paint something else there's no what there's no way you could not love being there yeah that's amazing all right let's do this this is the last one but this is a good one um never heard this one but this is this is to you cat christie's asking on one of your visits to heaven kat have you ever had a family dinner with father son and holy spirit what did the conversation can sound like i i've never had a dinner with all three of them i haven't i have visited with them separately and they've taken me different places in heaven i've i've spent i not i don't think i ever ate with any of them okay i think i've been in a bakery with jesus one time just because he was showing it to me he loves sweets yeah every baker that comes to heaven he's going to visit their shop really great i've been in the the i've been in the um mansion that is jesus christ has his own why wouldn't he he lived on the earth as a person okay he served god while he was here on the earth he has his own yes he's in the throne room a lot but he also has his own place what does he do he throws events there invites people just come home to heaven and let them meet all the prophets and all the stuff i've been there and all he served was desserts people so i hope you like dessert you had every kind of dessert imaginable on this glorious mansion and when you walk through the flowers are so high they're all greeting you you come in this beautiful carriage and then he sent for you to invite you to his place and there's people there you probably always wanted to meet if you said i always wanted to meet elijah i always wanted to meet queen esther i wanted to see david they would definitely be there for you and then you would all enjoy desserts on these tables and he's going to have dancing like beautiful dancing and i know in your mind you're thinking all these different styles of dance depending on what you like there's nothing defiling there's nothing degrading in heaven but beautiful um they dance all over heaven all the time usually from joy from celebration but everything you you usually think about is equated to what is in the what's in the in the um i'm trying to think of an earth ward right now they would compromise the area this is the best i could do of the throne room and even that would be hard for you to do if you have not been there the throne room is alive it gets huge it grows it's round the throne is in the middle of the throne room it's high and lifted up there's like platforms columns platforms columns and there's people and all different they're either worshiping or dancing or leaving sweets for jesus seriously all the way up the steps to where this massive throne is the father sits and his son sits next to him uh you have to walk past these living creatures that are so stunning to get up there and your eyes cannot contain uh so it's not like there's little small spaces and there's no place for you it's not like that you begin to worship everybody raises up off the floor the seraphim come down out of the glory cloud and they're on fire with passion and love for them with sin on the throne there's no way you couldn't love being in this place and so anyone who has someone there don't ever feel sorry for them that they're living they're existing to live you never die there's no thoughts of death there's no thoughts of harm nobody's ever sick nobody lacks everybody still wants to help one another with their events and stuff like that there's joy celebration no one is rejected no one's rejected everybody is cared about and loved and and the creatures you also can get to know all the creatures that they are not talking about the living creatures they're too busy i'm talking about creatures all over the world called heaven and the friendly forest is why they call it that in the valley of the falls uh there's just so many beautiful places and fun places i can't leave out the fun okay so no matter what when you know someone who's going and you know they're going i celebrate and i've been celebrating over marcus lamb recently a great man and woman of god have gone home to heaven my whole heart is so full for them of the glory they will experience just being in the presence um of the father of the son and holy spirit is still there people i know his base of operations is on the earth so don't even go there with me the holy spirit is an unlay unlimited layered being i hope that does something to your natural head unlimited layers of himself doesn't mean there's a million of them standing around it's not like he's here there's a million of them around him it's not like that the way that he is he has unlimited layers of himself where he sends that layer of him that looks just like him and is him he knows everything there here's everything there so when you invite the holy spirit to indwell you guess what you don't get a piece of him you get a whole of him in you that's good good good good yeah so when the holy spirit you know he's when the holy spirit lives in you that's not some euphemism or poetry it means he himself is there uh we would we would use the word in bodily form except he's a spirit being so it's not and he's killed him as a body yeah okay so spiritual body he's literally there the person of the holy spirit you get hold of him to indwell you and let me tell you he almost never stops talking to me he talks again a lot most of the time you hear him like out here speaking to you um and sometimes he'll even say oh don't turn there or don't go there or stop uh that's usually saying him saying that to you even if it's in your spirit you hear him but if you give him permission i want i want to end with this you if you're born again and you're not spirit filled invite holy spirit to indwell you you really must it's the power of god in you it gets you bold the power of god now lives in you and you have access to that and you can you need to say to the holy spirit i give you permission to talk to me even when i'm not paying attention and if you say those words to him he'll do it when when needed to protect you when needed to encourage you he will and and then you'll be the more you recognize he is there uh i talk to him like i do to jesus or the father um i've seen the outline of his being he's very powerful looking too he's outlined in fire he carries the fire of god uh on him he is god and uh they have the ability to step inside of each other i've already been in the throne and saw the father sitting there jesus gets up and steps inside the father the holy spirit comes wherever there goes that steps inside the father and then the three in one wow oh wow a five-year-old could understand that a five-year-old can understand the trinity and yet man in their natural mind still trying to figure out do they have three heads how does this work and then they step out and there they are the three individual gods the godhead but one thing is for sure they love you they care about you and they don't like the darkness that's good that's so good cat wow that's so so good so so so good all right well we got about a third of the way through the questions because i'm just enjoying it takes it longer than i love it i love the time we spend with each one but you know it's going to take us another couple hundred shows yeah he made me he picked me he made me first of all if you can imagine i'm so full of detail that's why i have a photographic memory so i never forget anything i saw heard or experienced but i grew up like really really i was really i was high maintenance because i knew things no one else knew and the family i knew things that my siblings were doing they didn't want me to know um but i also knew what god was saying and um so i was not normal even when i was little i ate once a day i slept four hours a day i was up all night long uh even young my mom would still always been this way i thought that was new in your life you've always been that way huh but i'm a detailed person which is good for god but when you're with somebody trying to be over a project or you're out picking something up from the store you're detailed then too you know i'm sure that sharpens my husband no i don't want that one it has to have this slant has this this hue this this tent this is not over here i don't want that and so i'm like that too so you get both of me you get all of that i but but it works well with heaven that's why yeah well i mean you're a revelator but you have a photographic memory and you are a photographer because to boot you i don't know the verb forget details and while you're not forgetting natural details you're seeing supernatural all around you at all times yes and i can't even i can't even you know your brain must be i mean it's like living in two worlds at the same time can't you are you um here's let me use human you know terminology language yeah while you're remembering in a in your photographic memory now you're seeing demons and angels and things as you walk around the room and this cruise ship or whatever are you recording and not forgetting what those as well do you remember what which entities were doing what how how far does their memory go well when i'm on the ship they try to not be there oh they do well they already know me because they know that i have this relationship with jesus christ they know uh they already know who i am i have they they they have blacklisted me because they could get cast out uh or i could say something that would freak them out you know the spirit or whatever uh and i won't tolerate when i get up in the morning say i'm not tolerating any of the darkness anywhere near me i take power over all the power of the enemy command the host of heaven you will shred mesh bash and trash every demon that even tries to come near me shred platforms that have been built in the spirit realm and some of those were on cruise ships because for for whatever reason uh people got away with certain things and then there's these spiritual platforms they would be destroyed if i was on that ship wow so so they don't have maybe as much activity because i'm in a captive place and there are captives already if i am there that's good well you know that's that's a thing in scripture whereas it was paul paul i know and such and such i know but i didn't know don't know you so they do know the high level uh apostles prophets just holy people men and women and children yes they do is it such that when they get on this cruise ship they have a meeting and everyone knows where the holy people are on the ship how does it go it's because of how much light you have coming out of you okay i mean they already know people who don't have christ uh it's not like they're not living obviously their body's living but their spirit man really doesn't have a lot of life in it and sometimes they may follow those people to see if they can get them pulled into something but i take authority over the whole ship wow wow wow yeah boy i would love to hear that you know i'd love to go to heaven one day and see what happened but i guess the evil you don't see the evil replayed that someone won i mean right if you go to heaven you know the only time you might see something like that is if he allows you to see what your prayers resulted in war without heaven against the enemy i think he probably it's not like it would really be there it would be something that you would get to see happen like in your life when you're praying and you were praying for somebody i think you do get to see the destruction that your prayers called calls again the enemy the spiritual darkness i'd love to see that so i'd like to see that now all right cat awesome awesome well tell people about your two websites cat we got revealingheaven.com on the screen tell us about that one yeah revealing heaven.com is where we will be putting our events which we are still going to plan some for this coming year we're going to plan some events here in the city i've already got invitations to go places um in this year so we'll be going to those places but we also have that's where our store is and our stores got very powerful things in it and you may have said well you've had some of these same uh if i've got some cds and dvds i've retained is because it's powerful truth that people need and there's always new people finding out i don't want them to lose the revelation all of those cds and dvds are not head knowledge not none of them are head knowledge every one of them contain revelation i don't know if i'm gonna have one here i thought i have one you don't know what happened to it but uh like we make things like this thing for your car that says i don't do demons this is a car magnet and we have people come up and take pictures of them so we have products that represent heaven on the earth or or sayings that the holy spirit has said and then ker.com is a whole separate website that is to get spiritual revelation from almost everything in there is revelatory we do have some images that you can see of things that have been made to represent like portals in heaven different things on the earth that i've seen so you can go to catcure.com and look at that there's also interviews on there like patricia king and other people have interviewed me those would be on catcure.com there's also truths there's a place uh that you can go watch quite a few videos and learn how to declare over your family members to be born again uh how to ask for grace for um uh i'm trying to remember what it's even called uh um abundant life abundant life grace after abundant life grace i think how to lose stuff out of your soul i think is on there um but those that is a platform where you can learn spiritual truths of revelation uh there's also all kinds of other things to do but it's the only place and i keep saying this it's the only place online if there's any other place online that's been made out there on facebook youtube that say give to me here that's not me okay catco.com is the only place you can go to and click on the treasury and give online all those other places they may use my face but they're not me i'm also going to say i will not tell you to go give to some missionary camp those people are trying to steal money from you or they're saying that i said to give to this group or for this cause that's not me and i don't do it on purpose because i don't want people getting ripped off yeah so go to category.com if you want to give and i do want to end with this make sure you are supporting elijah's an elijah streams thank you like steve said they they can't know every single person they put on there but they do know if they find out someone's not living right that's what they're saying we're not going to put them on there they're not going to even promote them i wouldn't either and sometimes people go through stages of their life where they're not hearing right or whatever reason but i tell you god calls him a platform for the prophets to speak for him and if he cares about steve and he put that in place then that is something that is definitely valid to give to your seating into the lives of millions of people when you give to him and helping to support his staff and future projects like going to israel if he ever does another tour of israel make sure you get to go on that tour it's amazing and so many things we do we speak for god we're not god but we speak for him we allow him to speak uh the best we possibly can because we want you to know him want you to know the truth the truth makes you free not lies and deception so you have a blessed day and yeah thank you kent i think days definitely never stop declaring declaration declaration is still prayer declaring declaring and decreeing over situations is still prayer it's a really high level of prayer that's good good good cat thank you again and again thank you for those kind words just now that was very nice of you and a quick reminder that wanda alger will be here tomorrow she's always very good and got good great revelation so god bless you all thank you again kat and we will see you all again tomorrow bye
